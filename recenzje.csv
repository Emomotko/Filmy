tt0400598; Adults often don't try to watch kids movies, except if they have to, as their own children's company. And they find it to be punishment or wasted time. Often not without a reason. But Lepel is a movie that should be watched without prejudices, and it will give you a lot in return, on the adult level.It is a movie about dreams, a dreams that can't turn to reality, analyzing limits how far can we go trying to live with or in them, and what are the compromises we make not to give them up completely, so at least a part of those dreams can come true.We see a boy who dreams his parents will return home. They are supposed to travel around the world, that's what his grandmother tells him.. But she is abusing him, while he is dreaming about his mother he doesn't see or doesn't care for abuse and for obvious lies she is telling him. We see a shy salesman in love with his female boss, doing the best work to impress her, but afraid to say a word, let alone ask her for a date, scared to lose the dream he lives in. We see a woman, trained driver, working in a store and dreaming of going to Africa rally but aware that she, as a woman, doesn't have a chance to do it - and still she keeps on practicing. We see a teacher eager to have his pupil win the mathematics contest, ready to kidnap a boy, help abuser, cheat children, just to have his dream come true. We see a girl, victim of mother's abuse, who only wants to stay unnoticed for as long as she can, and never to have any mother again - but finding herself in situation to help a boy desperately seeking for one.And all the dreams will somehow be realized... but not a single in a simple way, without sacrifices and compromises.A scene where a friendly salesman helps boy in search for new mother, and more than a hundred women take part in interview, asks us unpleasant questions about family in today society, when many women offer themselves as (foster)mothers, but mostly for selfish reasons, ready to do and give only what the boy had in his previous dysfunctional family. And the only good adult female person refuses to be a mother, because today families and parenting are so complicated that she feels she is not up to do it. People who have heart and conscience are rare, and don't fit in our world.In most children movies runaway kids have numerous adventures, they solve mysteries, find treasures, they are smarter than adults, go from peril to peril and nothing can happen to them. And if they have a company, police or secret services can't do anything to beat them.Kids in Lepel are not superheros. Yes, Lepel runs away, but he doesn't go to distant country or desert island. He lives in neighbourhood warehouse. A crowded place where he can hide, but always in danger to be found. Yes, a girl helps him. A girl who also lives there, for a long time. Unbelievable? For a short while, but then we learn that a salesman knows she is there, he helps her all the time, hides her, prevents other people to find her hiding place. These makes the story almost realistic.But a big flaw waits (as usually) till the end. Our older hero Max, salesman, is a lousy driver. But, to impress his boss who he is in love with, he drives a borrowed car so good that she takes him as a co-driver for the really race in Africa. And he drove so good only because a 8 year old boy (who also, of course, isn't a driver) tells him how to do it, using his knowledge of maths... So, goodbye driving instructors, all you need is a kid and in a few minutes you are new Schumacher or Loeb.Other than that, a film can be recommended to people who still have heart and conscience... and, let's hope, a family. 
tt0400598; I concur with what's been said here. A few additions: Loes, Carice and Max (the three main adult characters) play caricatures rather than personages - and they do this very well. This was to be expected of Loes Luca, whose middle name is "absurd", but seeing how Carice van Houten pulls off painting a non-dimensional character is amazing. She leaves Max, Pell--- um, Lepel, and Pleun, and you - and your children or grandchildren - guessing for almost the entire duration of the film. I knew she could play character roles with many dimensions, but this role of her is an achievement in itself. Perhaps that's a kids' eye view of adults - at least it makes it easier, even for someone pushing 50, to identify with the children. Lepel is called Lepel because he wears a "bracelet" that consists of a strand with 5 cubes with letters on his wrist: L E P E L. Try to imagine these five letters in a circle. Now, push the first two letters around the circle so that they end up being the last two, and you get the boy's real name. Because he's lost his memory, he doesn't know this. The fact that the alleged grandmother doesn't know the boy's name indicates that she is likely not be his real grandmother. The film also lightly brushes the subject of autism - the main character has trouble dealing with social relationships, but is excellent with numbers. All in all, an excellent, underrated film. Suitable for children, but there are layers in there that will please adults as well. 
tt0400598; Although I can't really write any kind of review without some memories of one of the main characters I'll try to write about the film a little, without telling too much. Lepel is a film about a boy, a boy whose parents are on a trip around the world in a hot-air balloon. He lives at his grandmothers' house which is also a shop for buttons. She makes him do loads of work and he obviously dislikes it, although he has gotten used to it I guess. He asks about his parents sometimes and his grandmother tells him time-and-time again they will return. One day, while at a big warehouse his life turns upside down after receiving a balloon from a salesman. Then the ride actually begins, we see the little kid making friends, having personal troubles and desperately trying to do what he thinks is best. At one point he is told very bad news and there is where my hard part was. Until this point it was mostly about feeling good, but here it changed for me... This is where I really got connected to the little kid (played by Joep Truijen) whose acting was actually very nice. The grandmother is played by Loes Luca whose performance is really great, Neeltje de Vree plays Pleun and is not always up to par which is really too bad, although her role is quite difficult. Barry Atsma (playing Max) is a little bit too much of a softy for me, as for Juffrouw de Boer (Carice van Houten): I can't really comment on her, we used to be in high school together thus my vision of her work is quite blurred.I would recommend this film for Sunday afternoons, preferably with kids from age 7 until 13-14. 
tt0008891; the blue bird from 1918 is one of the most beautiful, captivating films of all time. it is the story of 2 poor children who are visited by a fairy on Christmas eve. the fairy shows them how to see things through the eyes of God. she teaches them about what is truly important in life. they follow the fairy through many events and learn something new from each experience. if you have not seen this great silent film or have seen another version, then please take the time to watch this masterpiece, you will never forget it. the young girl who plays mytel (tula belle) is nothing short of tremendous. her acting is very natural and has a realism i've never seen in another child star. tula's facial expressions even without speech, is more effective than most child stars with both mediums. tula belle's performance in the blue bird is probably the single best performance by a child star of all time. 
tt0008891;  Maurice Maeterlinck's wonderful play is transformed into a magical film by Maurice Tourneur, one of the masters of early cinema.  Maeterlick's belief, that beauty is to be found in all things, is here given life in a film that works for adults and children.The visuals are splendid, and the effects gorgeous (reminiscent of Melies in some scenes and German expressionism in others).  And the two little children give excellent performances.The Grapevine Video print is very good, but it does have some nitrate decomposition, which is very sad.  I hope there is a pristine print of this masterpiece in an Archive somewhere - it deserves preservation.It will remind you of the 1939 "Wizard of Oz", especially in costume and sentiment, but pre-dates it by over 20 years.  An unmissable silent gem.   
tt0008891; There seem to be only a few directors of cinema's infancy whose films are worth much attention, Maurice Tourneur is one of them. His films may not always be the most entertaining, but most of them that I've seen contain something that interests. "Alias Jimmy Valentine", for example, has major story problems, but the heist scene is outstandingly filmed for 1915. Here, too, the allegorical messages (the bluebird is happiness and such) are too sappy at times, but then there's an inspired shot or something else innovative.The dark, flickering transfer of a deteriorated, bleeding print surely takes away from much of the visual qualities of this picture, but some of the photography and the color tinting shines through. Tourneur had some preparation for the dreamland journey of this film with the dream climax in "The Poor Little Rich Girl" of the previous year. The wonder and imagination of a child are well affected. Despite its age, the film's best element is still apparent, I think that is its awareness. Perhaps, most obviously, this film is comparable to "The Wizard of Oz" (1939), but more so to the 1914 trilogy, which Baum produced. The animal costumes are especially reminiscent, as are the cheap, but nice-looking backdrops and sets. Showing even more awareness are the trick shots in the way of a MA©liA¨s fantasy and the final shot where the boy turns to the camera and directly addresses the audience concerning the film's parable. So, to an extent, Tourneur overcomes the wear of age and the kiddy bluntness of the allegory. 
tt0008891; Somewhere or anywhere, during a snowy winter, young Robin Macdougall (as Tyltyl) and little sister Tula Belle (as Mytyl) learn their neighbor's child is sick. The ailing girl thinks she might be well and happy if she could only have young Tyltyl's caged bird, but Mytyl decides the siblings won't give it up. That evening, they are awakened by a winged fairy, Lillian Cook (as Berylune), who sets them off on a quest to find the elusive "Bluebird of Happiness" and put it in their suddenly empty cage.Companions like humanized feline Tom Corless (as Cat) consider sabotaging the mission, because he, canine Charles Ascot (as Dog), and other manifestations of inhumanity learn they will cease to exist if and when the children achieve success. Tyltyl and Mytyl search far and wide for the Bluebird of Happiness - meeting not only their dead grandparents, but also their future brother during their journey - but the creature remains hidden where they least expect to find itÂ  "The Blue Bird" is filled with beautiful thoughts from the original Maurice Maeterlinck play. Homilies like "Heaven is where you and I kiss each otherÂ " seems as good a definition as any. With majestic allegory by director Maurice Tourneur, production designer Ben CarrA©, and their crew, it was probably unwise to try to improve this orchestrated silent version of "The Blue Bird" - and filmmakers famously failed twice. Despite the ravages of time, this is the definitive version of the classic story.Regrettably, the film has deteriorated beyond restoration in some spots. Moreover, some cutting has been done. Most famous is the trimming of a nude child sleeping right of mother "Night" - still, the naked form appears full, early in the sequence. Probably, the censors left the long shots intact. The children were modestly and tastefully photographed, by the way. Also, it does seem like some exposition is missing about the diamond-studded hat Tyltyl is given - the turning of which prompts magic.After the huge success of Mary Pickford as "The Poor Little Rich Girl" (1917), Mr. Tourneur was obviously riding a creative peak. Within a year, he had three more critically acclaimed classics - "Barbary Sheep" (1917), "The Blue Bird" (1918), and "Prunella" (1918). All three placed in "Motion Picture" magazine's year's best photoplays (at #4, #6, and #3).Probably, "The Blue Bird" was too long and episodic a flight for most 1918 theatergoers, and the film performed less than spectacularly at the box office. Potential plot threads, like the Cat's mutiny, appear curiously underdeveloped. Still, the film's beauty shines through. And, the dream-like quality present in the tinted, flickering, wordless scenes only add to the magic.Perhaps most incredible is the not original, yet startling in context ending - young Tyltyl (Macdougall) unexpectedly "speaks" directly to the audience (about the quest) while the once sickly, but now beautiful young Katherine Bianchi smiles knowingly at his side - sister Mytyl (Belle) is regulated to the background, most definitely pondering this latest turn of eventsÂ  ********* The Blue Bird (3/31/18) Maurice Tourneur ~ Robin Macdougall, Tula Belle, Lillian Cook, Tom Corless 
tt0008891; As it is well-known among silent film connoisseurs, the fine Arts were an essential influence on silent films in general and Herr Maurice Tourneur's work in particular. His beautiful oeuvres gave him fame and prestige around the world from his French period in the mid 10's to his career in the USA."The Blue Bird" (1918) tells the story of two poor children, Mytyl and Tyltyl, who are led by the fairy Berylune in the search, around a fantastic world, for the blue bird of happiness. The film belongs to Herr Tourneur's American silent film period, and in this movie it is possible to watch all his artistic virtues in full display. This early astounding production is striking even today for its great artistic merits. The film was based on a book written by the Belgian poet Herr Maurice Maeterlinck and maybe Herr Tourneur during his young days could have illustrated it due to his earlier career as a book illustrator orÂ  MEIN GOTT!!! Perhaps he even read it! In any case, Herr Tourneur adapted and transferred the fairy tale story to the silent screen in a superb way.The film exudes classicism and even romanticism, artistic subjects that Herr Tourneur know very well how to employ in the world of fantasy. There is amazing art direction, elaborate decors and costumes and witty technical effects, not to mention the inventiveness that can be seen in every shot of the film and in the beautiful, exemplary photography of Herr John van den Broek and Lucien Andriot that captures the atmosphere of the classical fairy books through a cinema lens in a masterly way.Probably the story can be considered as affected, even innocent in this modern time but even that has a special value in artistic terms for this film, that baroque taste and out of date atmosphere fit perfectly in the story that moves from the real to the dream world, from the real to the unreal. Herr Tourneur's interpretation of this fantastic universe is a prodigious work, imaginative and inventive and shining with brilliant artistic merits.And now, if you'll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must listen to the gracious caw of the Schloss crows.Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com/ 
tt0008891; Maurice Maeterlinck's play "The Blue Bird" was produced for the first time in America in October 1910 and was considered a success. If Maurice Tourneur's film productions of both "The Blue Bird" and "Prunella" had met with the success they deserved, they may have paved the way in the twenties for a fantasy film genre instead of the over population of sheiks and flappers!! Most critics were abundant in their praise - "The Moving Picture World" saw in it "the simplicity of childhood and the wisdom of deep and kindly philosophy", Photoplay also praised it as "one of the most important productions ever made" but unfortunately Motion Picture Magazine spoke for the philistine portion of the public when it said "Seven reels of children and trailing through fairy places with bread, water, light and fire is frankly tedious on the screen". The production values were moral and allegorical as well as beautifully pictorial and those of the public that rejected it were all the worse for it.When Mytyl refuses to give her little bird to the sickly child across the way she and brother Tyltyl are visited by a strange old fairy who sends them on a journey of self discovery and to seek the true meaning of happiness. They first meet the spirit of water and fire that their mother had told them about (and they had scoffed at her), their dog and cat then begin to converse with them and tell them all the stories they could only bark and miaow out before.The special effects performed by Ben Carre who was closely associated with Maurice Tourneur, are extraordinary. The children are magically dressed, spilt milk turns into a lovely maid and the fairy of light finally whisks them all to the Fairy Palace, flying high above the roof tops. However Fairy Berylune, who first came to the children has said that whoever finishes the journey with the children shall die - so the cat leads the party who will try to stop the children finding the blue bird. Only the faithful little dog promises to protect them. The Underground Palace of Night - Mother Night has two children, Sleep and Death (probably a bit heavy going for children in the audience) and Mytyl and Tyltyl also find ghosts, sickness, War and terrors behind heavy wooden doors - but no blue birds. They visit the graveyard where the "happy dead sleep" but at a turn of TylTyl's diamond it becomes a beautiful flower land. They finally find the blue bird at their grandparent's little house where they also visit their little brothers and sisters who died in infancy. Unfortunately, when they leave, the blue bird flies away. On to the Palace of Happiness where luxury and riches abound, then there is also the "Happiness of the Home", "Joy of Pure Thoughts" and "Springtime". Another amazing sequence was in the land of children waiting to be born. A ship was waiting to take all the little children to their waiting mother's arms.Enchanting Tula Belle was born in Norway and was just wonderful as Mytyl, a real child if ever there was one. Unlike the two other youngsters in "The Blue Bird" , Robin MacDougall and Katharine Bianchi, she did have a reasonable career as a child actress before retiring in 1920.Highly, Highly Recommended. 
tt0008891; It's a pity that the 1918 version of "The Blue Bird" suffers so much from nitrate decomposition. Were it not for that I would give it a full 10 points. Nonetheless, what we have is sufficient to give great pleasure and it is certainly far superior to the 1940 version with Shirley Temple.Some of the scenes have a rather staged look but, even so, one admires the beautifulÂ<U+0097>often elegantÂ<U+0097>artistic consciousness in their presentation. This is particularly true of the backdrops. Generally, I thought the restoration was pretty good with effective use of tinting to make the most of the emotional atmosphere of the various sequences.I liked the presentation of the messageÂ<U+0097>always an important factor in a fairy tale. The quest for happiness which is always found to be closer than we expect, the discovery of joy in the joy of others, the beautiful and wonderful intangible world of the imagination and the truth of dreamÂ<U+0097>all these are beautifully presented through the innocence of the children. And here one must admire the performances of little Tula Belle as Mytyl and Robin Macdougall as Mytyl's older brother, Tyltyl. Tula, particularly, has an engaging naturalness which is wonderful. Dog and Cat look forward to "The Wizard of Oz" and the actors certainly convey the habits of the creatures they portray.The allegory with its spiritual message was reminiscent of the Narnian series of C.S. Lewis and the way the point was driven home at the end was very effective. Finally, I think that the music score showed excellent taste and skill in the way it was wedded to the film.The Blue Bird is a beautiful film with a universal message. 
tt0008891; The Belgian author and symbolist playwright Maurice Maeterlinck was a very popular literary figure of his day. His play "PellA©as et MA©lisande", in fact, inspired at least four well-known musical works by FaurA©, SchA¶nberg, Sibelius and, most famously, the full-length opera of the same name by Claude Debussy.The heavy symbolism of his plays including his "fairy" play, "L'Oiseau Bleu" (The Blue Bird.) from 1909 apparently intrigued the public in the first part of the 20th century. But when his works were placed on the Roman Catholic Index of Forbidden Books, they, naturally, became even more popular! There have been many film versions of "The Blue Bird", most notably, the unsuccessful 1940 version with Shirley Temple and the 1976 Russian-American disaster with Elizabeth Taylor. The present film is a 1918 silent film by the renowned French director (working in America at this time.) Maurice Tourneur.The cast of this film is unfamiliar to present-day audiences. The little girl who played Mytyl was Tula Belle (Hollingshead), she was born in Norway (to an American father at least.) and died in California in 1992! The boy Robin MacDougall seems to have made only this one film and the rest of the cast are not likely to be alive in 2007 as they'd mostly have to be well over 100. So this is a fascinating look at long-gone film techniques and acting styles.The DVD is based on an obviously deteriorated print but restored, as well as possible, at the George Eastman House in Rochester, New York. Various scenes were tinted in accordance with the theories of what each scenes' mood was meant to be. The "special effects" were adequate for the period but obviously not up to modern computer-generated effects.The characters are generally allegorical with actors portraying the personifications of Light, Night, Dog, Cat, Water, Milk, Bread etc. The lengthy scene with unborn children clearly mirrored the ideology of the time that one has a duty to have many children. A similar scene with the voices of unborn children in the Richard Strauss opera (1918 coincidentally.) "Die Frau Ohne Schatten" (The Woman Without a Shadow"), a similar ode to fecundity, shows the obvious influence of this play and probably mirrors the attitudes against Margaret Sanger and her birth-control followers. (But Sanger largely prevailed, at least in the U.S.) Another obvious influence of this play is on the 1939 film "The Wizard of Oz". In Judy's last speech, she realizes that if happiness can't be found at home "in your own backyard", it can't be found at all. There was also a popular but now rather campy song made popular by Jan Peerce in 1948, "Bluebird of Happiness". (He did an earlier version in 1935.) This DVD is an important reminder of these old attitudes and it certainly has its moments of beauty. On the whole, though, it is, in my opinion, rather of a "hoot". The acting is strictly of the period and everything else about it is quite dated. 
tt0008891; Taken from Maurice Maeterlinck's play (which was produced in the period immediately after Barrie's successful "Peter Pan") about 2 children who must go on an epic journey to find the Blue Bird of Happiness. Their journey takes them through the houses of terror, excessive wealth, and happiness. There are some very interesting scenes visually speaking. In the early sequences, we see the common household items come to life, such as milk (a lovely woman in flowing white robes), the family dog and cat (who bear comparison to the animals in the silent versions of "Oz"), a sugar loaf (amusingly portrayed by a man in a white tube costume with a pointy head) and most impressively fire (an interpretive dance with striking impact). Unfortunately some of these early scenes are almost ruined by the deterioration of the print.Later they see some somewhat terrifying things as they must enter the house of "Mrs. Night". Upon leaving there, they encounter their dead grandparents in a graveyard, who remonstrate with them for not visiting their graves enough. That's typical of the many ways in which this film attempted to give children a guilt trip about not taking things in their lives seriously enough. I found it bizarre that their "dead brothers and sisters" were also present, and there were a full half dozen of them. That would indicate an infant mortality rate above 80%. There's an amusing bit where they are in some kind of house that symbolizes excessive luxury. All the "things" begin to turn from their mission and enjoy the luxury, including the Sugar Loaf who is being licked by a half dozen lovely ladies! They end up in the house of happiness, where they see a deified version of their mother and in one interesting bit they come upon all the children who have not yet been born.The children who portrayed Mytyl and Tytyl were quite engaging, but most of the other performances in the film felt very 2 dimensional. Although there is some stylization, a lot of the shots feel very stage-bound. I think Tourneur should have strayed further from the story's original stage version and made it more cinematic in general. Also I think the film's story and its message are hopelessly obvious. There really isn't a feeling of continuity in the children's character transformations, they seem confused and at times foolish only to suddenly realize what's happening in the film's conclusion -- which might work in terms of the plot but it doesn't make this a richer film. In the end I think it has to be called an interesting failure by Tourneur in terms of expanding the scope of film fantasy. 
tt0008891; The Blue Bird (1918) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Poor children Mytyl (Tula Belle) and Tyltyl (Robin Macdougall) are visited by a fairy (Lillian Cook) who takes them on a trip to see what's really important in life. THE BLUE BIRD was directed by Maurice Tourneur, a highly visionary director who actually does a very good job with the look of this film as it's certainly one of the more impressive films visually from this era. This was actually the first version of this story that I've ever seen, which is somewhat shocking considering how many there have actually been. This is basically a fantasy-adventure film as the children and the fairy go searching for the "Bluebird of Happiness" which they are hoping will cure a sick nature. The film really does seem like a darker version of THE WIZARD OF OZ and it's funny because if you've seen any early version of Oz you'll remember that many of the animals were played by humans in costumes and that's the same case here. I've read many reviews that say this makes a film look silly but I'd disagree. I'm going to guess that at the time people were very use to this practice and I'd argue that in today's time it doesn't look silly but instead it adds a surreal effect to the film. Another gimmick is that the kids are able to view the souls of various objects including fire and even bread. The visual effects here aren't ground-breaking and they're not among the best I've ever seen but they are still impressive for the time. I found the performances of the two leads to be very good as was Cook at the fairy who really gives a comforting performance. I think there are some pacing issues in the film and even at just 80-minutes the film is a little slow at times. With that said, it's still an interesting visual film and for that it's worth viewing. 
tt0289438; If you want to make a worthwhile slasher film, there has to be certain elements present. If any are missing then this will just be an adventure for Paul Naschy completists, which is not a bad thing.There is plenty of gore and violence after the movie gets going for a while. It is not overly gory, but enough to make it a good slasher. The gore does look realistic, which is good, as did the decapitation. There was plenty of screaming, too.The best endowed girl in the film does give us a show with her boyfriend. When the slasher puts her away for later, her stupendous breasts are covered in blood. We get to see those breasts over and over.Paul Naschy made a really good killer. He had a sinister smile and was very funny as he collected his victims.It was a very suspenseful film. I won't say scary, but very tense. It kept you captivated through the entire time. The ending is, unfortunately, unclear. 
tt0289438; The World of Horror has lost one of its last remaining icons. I was deeply saddened to learn that Paul Naschy (born Jacinto Molina), a true deity of European Exploitation cinema and one of the last living legends of the Horror genre, died of pancreatic cancer at the age of 75 in his native Madrid last week. Maybe best known for playing the Werewolf Waldemar Daninsky in thirteen films between 1968 and 2004, Naschy was a multi-talent who scripted and directed many of the films he starred in himself, and doubtlessly the most charismatic and influential leading man in Spanish Horror cinema. Not all of the films in Naschy's career may qualify as 'good' in a traditional sense (though some, such as the near-brilliant "El Jorobado De La Morgue" of 1973, doubtlessly qualify as great), but they are almost entirely highly entertaining and impossible-not-to-love gems of European Horror cinema, and they all have a certain inimitable charm to them that can not be found anywhere but in a Naschy-film. The world of cult-cinema is a lot poorer for the loss of this great man, but it is oh so much richer for the wonderful films he has given us. So what would be a better way of mourning this icon than to celebrate his work by watching as many of his films as possible? I had delayed the viewing of this film several times, for the reason that I generally prefer my Horror to be old, and therefore rather watched the films Naschy did in the 70s and 80s. These preconceptions were unfounded, as one of the most wonderful films Naschy ever was in was the 2004 film "Rojo Sangre", which was directed by his son and which basically was a giant tribute to leading man Naschy. Carlos Gil's "School Killer" of 2001 is indeed not one of Naschy's best films, but it s still a highly entertaining Naschy one-man-show that none of my fellow fans of the man should miss. The main attraction of the film is, of course, Paul Naschy, who stars as the eponymous School Killer. The film starts out pretty unimaginative when a bunch of kids decide to spend the night at an abandoned old boarding school set in the middle of nowhere in the mountains. Strange and supernatural things soon begin to happen, and when it turns out that the school was the site of a massacre in 1973, things begin to get out of hand... The film begins unspectacular, and gets a little ridiculous when the first supernatural events occur. However, it really catches up in the second half, and once one has acquired a taste for the rather far-fetched premise of the film, it actually becomes really creepy. Naschy is once again awesome and wonderfully creepy in his role, which basically carries the whole film. The rest of the cast aren't memorable, and their characters are pretty forgettable, however, even though the young characters are a little annoying at times, Naschy's creepiness makes it possible to actually feel for them.Overall, "School Killer" is no must see, but it is a decent little film and, especially now, it is mandatory for us Naschy fans to see the master in as many of his later roles as possible. There are dozens of Naschy films to recommend over this one, such as "El Jorobado De La Morgue" ("The Hunchback of the Morgue", 1973), "La Orgia De Los Muertos" (The Hanging Woman, 1973), "El Espanto Surge De La Tumba" ("Horror Rises from The Tomb", 1973), "Latidos De Panico" ("Panic Beats", 1983), any of the Waldemar Daninsky films like "La Noche De Walpurgis" ("The Werewolf Vs the Vampire Woman", 1971) or, more recently, "Rojo Sangre" (2004). However, once one has seen many of the films Naschy has been in, this is yet another worthy addition to his oeuvre. Once again: The World of Horror has lost one of its last icons. My deep condolences go to Paul Naschy's family. Rest in peace, Hombre Lobo. You were a legend, and you always will be. And legends never die! 
tt0289438; A group of teens decide to take their slumber party to an abandoned school where, 27 years prior, a horrible massacre took place. Unfortunately for them, the person responsible for the slaughter still lurks the halls of the derelict school and he is not happy with their presence.This film is not like most modern teen slashers we've seen. It's much darker, much more suspenseful, no wise-cracking murderer, etc., and I liked it for those reasons. From a film-making point-of-view, it's not great. The acting is below average. The writing was pretty bad and quite full of clichA©s, containing randomly tossed-in references to American horror films, some that didn't even make sense (like. . . "Have you seen Scream 3?", a girl asks. Yes, I have, and it had nothing to do with walking through the doors of an old school so it in no way relates to this film). But, hey, it's a slasher flick, those are part of the fun. Also, the underutilization of characters was heavily exhibited in this film. There were six main characters (not including The Security Guard) and, to be honest, only three or four were really used. Two characters (the token black guy and some other girl that wasn't important enough to get a label) barely spoke: Between them, I'd estimate about five or six lines total. Also, the girls (other than one) weren't formed well enough to differentiate them from one another. They could've replaced each of the girls with one another repeatedly throughout the film and I wouldn't have noticed the difference. The pacing, however, works well as the horror begins right from the start and rarely ceases. The atmosphere is utilized well and the direction reveals some truly chilling moments. . . although, the overall appearance is a bit cheap-looking due to, what I assume is, low-grade camera equipment (and operation). The ending, though I liked the idea they were going for, was fairly poorly done. It felt rushed and without explanation enough to make it effective. With the amount of time they spent running around looking for nothing, they could've spent a little bit more time on the conclusion to make sure it didn't feel like some random event thrown in for no good reason (which is a flaw many modern horror films are afflicted with). However, ignoring a few irksome issues and trying to focus on the first 98% of the film rather than the ending, this is actually a rather good modern slasher that should be checked out, especially if you're a fan of Spanish and/or atmospheric horror.Obligatory Slasher Elements:- Violence/Gore: There's a good bit of blood and gore, realistically done, but not buckets. The violence is extremely well done, not to excess, but pretty brutal at points.- Sex/Nudity: Little bit, and with the hottest girl in the film.- Cool Killer: Well, security guards are hardly considered 'cool,' but this guy is pretty wicked. His creepy smile was chilling.- Scares/Suspense: The suspense is top-notch. . . very tense, very well done. There are also some extremely creepy moments that fused jump scares and the spooky atmosphere.- Mystery: None at all, really.- Awkward Dance Scene: Of course: between a couple of guys and a half-unwilling female in the flashback.- Classic Quote of the Film: 'One more trophy.' Final verdict: 7/10. This may be stretching it, but fans of Session 9 might want to check it out simply for the similar tone and atmosphere.-AP3- 
tt0289438; Six teenagers go to an old remote abandoned school where 27 years ago a horrible massacre took place for a night of fun and pranks. Instead the kids run afoul of the vicious crazed security guard (excellently played with supremely creepy menace by Spanish horror icon Paul Naschy) who committed the nasty killings. Director Carlos Gil relates the intriguing story at a brisk pace and does an adept job of creating a compellingly spooky and mysterious atmosphere. The witty script by Tino Blanco and Mercedes Holgueras offers a clever and inspired blend of slasher and supernatural elements that keep the viewer guessing to the very end. The slick cinematography by Fernando Arribas makes expert use of light and shadow. David San Jose's moody score likewise does the trick. The attractive and appealing young cast all contribute lively and engaging performances, with especially praiseworthy turns by Carlos Fuentes as ringleader Ramon, Olivia Molina as the panicky Maria, Zoe Berriatua as obnoxious joker Jordi, and Carmen Morales as spunky goth chick Sandra. The murder set pieces are every bit as bloody and brutal as they ought to be. Terrific whammy of a surprise dark ending, too. A solid and satisfying shocker. 
tt0289438; Spain has produced a number of good horror films over the last two decades, with directors such as Alejandro Amenabar, Alex de la Iglesia and Jaume BalaguerA3 making some truly standout films. School Killer stars one of the main players of seventies/eighties Spanish horror films in the form of the great Paul Naschy, but overall I'm not surprised that this film doesn't get mentioned alongside the likes of Tesis, Rec and Day of the Beast as one of the better modern films to come out of Spain as despite some good ideas, there's far too many things wrong with it. The plot is not particularly original and focuses on the common horror film ideas of a bunch of kids getting into trouble and an old abandoned building harbouring a maniacal killer. The kids decide to go to the old school building, where one of their dads stayed twenty seven years earlier, for a party but it soon becomes apparent that there's something strange going on inside the building and they soon learn that the boy's father was the only survivor of a massacre the night that he and his friends stayed there.The best thing about this film is undoubtedly the atmosphere and director Carlos Gil succeeds in creating a truly foreboding feeling that suits the film very well and excellently compliments the plot and the building at the centre of the story. I went into this film expecting a slasher (and thus without any high hopes) but to the film's credit, it actually tries to be more than that and it could be argued that the film is more of a psychological thriller. This certainly gives the film an extra element of interest and it manages to take a mysterious plot and blend it well with the gore you'd expect from a slasher. Paul Naschy is obviously the main standout of the cast and he still has a good screen presence despite his advanced years and provides an extremely effective villain. As mentioned, the film does feature some good gore and although it doesn't feature all the way through, what we do get works well within the context. The film is rather slow to start and it doesn't really get interesting until the final third. However, despite this, the film doesn't end very well and there's too much left unexplained for this to be an effective film overall. Still, School Killer is better than a lot of modern horror films and is at least worth a look. 
tt0289438; Why has RamA3n(Carlos Fuentes)brought his five college mates to a spooky abandoned school building which used to service the black sheep children of wealth? That answer might just lie in a diary in his possession supposedly written by his dying father. What they come in contact with is in fact a relived episode involving another group of six, with five of them presumably meeting graphic fates at the hands of a sadistic security guard(Paul Naschy)which occurred 20 some odd years ago. But, as they seek out a way to escape from this place, terror awaits them as that horrifying moment in time replays as the group run for their lives, often in states of panic as the killer begins to hunt and destroy them in a various bloody ways. Will RamA3n and any of his pals survive this night of horror or becomes ghosts forever repeating the very same night like those before them?Stylish Spanish slasher has that professional gloss and potent, shocking violence to match. Some witty exchanges between the characters..layered in their dialogue are pop-culture references to American horror films which might annoy some viewers. A demented Naschy is really ferocious with the kiddies as he attacks them gleefully..quite a bloodthirsty maniac who carries out his violent acts with relish. I found the loud musical cues a bit annoying and the filmmakers often use flashbacks from previous events in the film as reminders to the audience. I don't think these tricks are necessarily needed, but felt the director wished to communicate in depth with the viewer hence the use of cues and flashbacks. A minor diversion for this film's plot keeps moving and the camera follows the pace of the characters and how they react to the chaotic situation presented to them. Your enjoyment of this film may ultimately come down to your acceptance of the paranormal supernatural aspects of the plot. Moments in time relived and a killer who continues his work seemingly from the grave. The twist does seem a bit jarring and abrupt, but this might(..or might not)work considering how the story plays out regarding why RamA3n's father is shown amongst those ghosts re-enacting those grisly events two decades prior. I will say that this film probably wouldn't hold up if scrutinized in detail, but as a slasher flick, it's a breath of fresh air. 
tt0289438; I doubt that people from 3 years ago will look at this but they seemed to be having a hard time figuring out the story. In 1973 3 men and 3 women went to the school to party. Let me say I was in my 20s in 73 and we didn't have a boom box. The security guard (Naschy) kills 5 of them but the last man alive gets Naschy in the head with an ax and throws him down a well. 27 years later the son of the man who "killed" Naschy comes to the abandoned school with his father's diary and the ghosts of the 6 people murdered are seen by the 6 who are there now. The father is trying to tell them Naschy is alive but by the time they figure it out they are all killed and become ghosts too. Paul Naschy gives this movie both class and makes the ghost story which is somewhat old fashioned really work. A lot better than the Blair Witch or the slasher side of the film do. The only thing I didn't like was the foreign "rock" soundtrack. If you have to use "rock" do like Argento and use Iron Maiden or Motorhead. Maybe these guys are big in Spain I don't know. For great Naschy look for Frankenstein's Bloody Terror or Night of the Werewolf (The Craving) or at least Horror Rises From the Tomb. 
tt0289438; Bit of a curate's egg, this one. I started off hating it, with it's predictable' Old Dark House' set-up, it's constant references to recent US horrors and regular trips up and down dimly lit corridors.But it does get going and has it's moments of originality.I began to wonder , once the killing started, how they were going to last out with only a cast of six but then we get flashbacks to a previous visit to the building and see a whole slew of gory killings which is pretty effective.Naschy is fine and by the end it's been an enjoyable enough movie. It just does not jump up and grab one, hard enough. 
tt0289438; An annoying group of ex-students from 'Monte Alto International High School' decide to spend a night in the now abandoned institution where a 'mystery' killer called the watchman played by horror legend Paul Naschy murders them off one by one."School Killer" features some references to such teen slasher staples like "Scream" or "Friday the 13th".The climatic twist ending looks like lilted from "The Sixth Sense".The uncertainty about whether the homicidal watchman is alive or dead provide some mild interest,but the characters are one-dimensional and the endless scenes of walking through dark school corridors really got on my nerves.The presence of charismatic Paul Naschy almost saves this clichA©d slasher flick.There is also some decent gore on display including a splendidly bloody beheading.It's nice to see Manuela Velasco of "Rec" fame in a small role.4 out of 10. 
tt0289438; This movie is not a typical slasher. The tension is very high, and the story is appealing. The acting is below average, and there are a lot of holes in the plot. Nevertheless, it successfully kept my attention till the end. Talking about the end, while I understand that the director wants to leave us some space for imagination, but that is TOO MUCH imagination he's asking for. I thought there will be at least another 20-30 minutes to go, and the credit rolls already! We do not know who the killer was, what his father wanted to tell them, how each member died, who moved the bodies, etc. I really wish the DVD featurettes will have the director provide us with some explanation. 
tt0254942;  i understand that there's probably not a lot of people who are going to see this movie, much less, comment on it.. but, if you are one of the few lucky people who are reading this comment right now then i just want to let you know that Akkare Akkare is one the funniest movies ever made.The whole beginning of it is just getting into the story, the whole premise of two confused Malayalee men in the middle of America is great.. as soon as Mohanlal & Sreenivassan arrive in America the fun begins. There were few scenes of pure hilarity that i have to pick out ~- The part where Sreenivassan is framed stealing from the grocery store and put in jail and Mohanlal runs after the cop car he's in.- The part where Mohanlal and Sreenivassan put soot on their faces and put on black shirts to act like negroes to convince a Malayalee lady to give them her clothes (lol)- The part where Mohanlal and Sreenivassan do that funny dance on the top of a building and on the sidewalks, thats just funny for millions of reasons- The part when Sreenivassan gets the big gold crown stuck on his head and him and Mohanlal run from the whities.Haha, you should just watch this movie for those parts alone... hilarious. I think Mohanlal and Sreenivassan make an awesome team, definitly the funniest that I've ever seen. This is kind of like Dumb & Dumber, Malayalam style, but Mohan & Sreeni are ten times funnier than Jim Carrey and whats-his-face will ever be.I recommend this to anybody w/ a sense of humor!  ,D
tt0254942; I felt compelled to write a review due to the fact that the other two reviews (murli786 from Kuwait & Rob Stephen of the US) apart from Jenna's, seem to trash the movie. In fact I created this account just a while back.(Yeah, i am bored as work)I may not be the right person for the job but here goes.While Nadodikattu & Pattanapravesham (It's prequels) were brilliant on their own right, AAA is not a movie to be belittled, in my not so humble opinion. Yes Rob, I agree the dubbing was far beyond poor and yes murali786, while AAA may not be everyone's cup of tea, to term it 'awful' just hurts. I now know how my gf feels when i tell her 'Titanic (97)'sucked. (To the more polite, kindly substitute 'sucked' with 'overrated'). This movie is not supposed to be taken seriously.I believe this movie has a cult status among Malayalees born abroad, just as the Hindi flick 'Dil Chahta Hai' identified more with the urban Indian than the rural one.The banter between Ramdas & Vijayan reveal more hilarity with every watch. Special mention must be given to Soman for his hotel check-in scene. Even Paul Barber and his entourage provide for laughs, especially Martha when Mukesh & Raju go house hunting. Some silly trivia. Paul Barber's associate in Chicago is one 'Robert Redford'. In the Negro scene, if you listen closely, Vijayan mentions that they are 'BLACK'negroes.I rated the movie only 7*'s due to the fact that i've watched it so many times over (I sadly know almost every dialogue) that its ruined my initial "lol" experience.I don't think you'll regret watching this. Repeated viewings highly recommended. 
tt0254942; I feel quite cheated as i write this summary...the potential that got thrown away. I am a massive fan of the run away classic Nadodikattu, thus when my mom told me that sequels exist, i was estatic. Yet my initial dreams of further cinematic glory fell short to a slew of overwrought uncomedic sequences coupled with what must be...the worst English dubbing Iv'e ever witnessed. Aside from the scene where Both CID's dress up as "Negroes" to gain a woman's laundry, the entire plot made no sense. Why would India's top secret police department send these incompetent two into America? The fact that neither can speak a stitch of English is only half the problem. What made Nadodikattu so epic and amazing was its heart. You felt for the characters as the struggled to make ends meet. You felt the pain when Dasen's family suffered. In this film all conflicts are ultimately unimportant and are taken as a poorly designed vehicle to showcase the film's "BONANZA" style of inprobability and foolishness. Good yourself a favor...don't watch this...just watch Nadokikattu again. 
tt0254942; I saw it last night and have one word to describe the movie - AWFUL. All the scenes mentioned by the Texan who wrote the comment seemed long drawn and bereft of any comedy. Undoubtedly, Srinivasan & Mohanlal are a class act, but this movie is a sad caricature of their efforts.Unlike the prequel to this one, there were 2 other movies that were good with songs and one liners. Parvathy seems to be wasted and so is Jagadesh. Please check out the climax - it is sheer absurdity. Soman has a pistol that can fire off 6 rounds, but the director seems to have forgotten it as he closes his eyes and keeps firing around him. It just showed what a bad script the movie was and waste of such good talent. I give this movie 1 out of 10

tt0125994;  Don't be misled by ANY of the US critics who reviewed this remarkable movie. The Emperor's Shadow's (Qin Song) opening sequence-anything but subtle with hundreds of enormous bells being sacrificed to a thundering cataract of water and river foam--and the dying Emperor's last pronouncement are a perfect preamble for what follows.And pay no attention to the cursory plot summaries--far more is  involved here than a simple stubborn musician who seduces the Emperor's favorite daughter and refuses to compose a national anthem.  Word play, puns and verbal sparring are very important in the film (e.g. the instrument the musician plays is a qin, the Emperor is head of the Qin dynasty), and the love/hate, cat and mouse, art vs politics, peace vs war, pacifism vs force themes embodied in the relationship between the Emperor and the musician is one of the most fascinating interpersonal conundrums since Henry II and Thomas Becket.The fact that this extraordinary film did not make the rounds of all US art houses is a tragedy.  The scope, the grandure, the uniformly excellent performances, the stunning cinematography add up to a unique and unusually compelling experience.The Emperor's Shadow may also be one of your very last chances to witness a true epic--there are no computer generated masses here--each one of those thousands and thousands of soldiers is a real human being.The Emperor's Shadow is a misunderstood, over-looked, underestimated masterpiece.  
tt0125994;  This is an excellent, excellent movie. It seamless linked all those major stories that happened during the lifetime of first Chinese emperor. Jiang, Wen is a well-known actor. Sometimes it is hard to actually see a famous actor as the actual character. However Mr. Jiang has done a great job. Even though his face is so familiar to many of us, but in this particular movie, he is indeed the first Emperor of China.Best of all, it is not boring to watch this movie at all. Sometimes it is hard to follow through a lengthy old historic movie, which one can not reflect upon oneself. However, this film grabs audiences' attention, and one wants to watch it till the end.Ge You the other main character is also so excellent. It is definitely an epic. It has love, hate, massacre, etc. It may not have the fancy elegance as Titanic, but it is absolutely more meaningful.  
tt0125994; I cannot say enough about this film. The production value was TOPS. The locations, story, acting, music, and everything else involved in it was extraordinary. I watched it 10 times (Each time forcing others to watch, which they all agreed with me). It should have won an Oscar, but since there are probably big politics with Mainland China vs Hong Kong, it never got a mention. I am not Chinese, but do appreciate a fine film. WATCH IT!!! TRUST ME. You will agree. The music writer scored many other Top Chinese films like Farewell My Concubine, Ju Duo, and Raise The Red Lantern, just to name a few! WoW! The acting was superb. Natural and realistic. I cried each and every time I watched it. What can I say? I definitely think it was one of the best made films I've seen in many years. I am an actor and have produced a few action films (nothing that compares to this, or even gets close...PLEASE! I wish!). This has every emotion and is to be considered an EPIC of Extraordinary Proportions! 
tt0125994;  A stirring beautiful epic with a heart at the center. The kind of movie that the U.S. doesn't make much anymore. Not amazing that people in around 200 BC had feelings and emotions like ours, even the people in high high places. There's one line about sex and politics (the emperor talks to his council about how affairs of the state have no relation to sexual matters) that had the small audience (the movie has been playing here for 28 weeks) laughing. Really enjoyable and interesting movie. 
tt0125994;  I was surprised at how little information there is about this movie. This stunning piece of work is definitely worth more international regconition. The Emperor of Qin (Ching Shi Huang Ti) is a very popular figure here in Asia and everyone knows him thru history classes and here, is one of my favourite movie on the depiction of Emperor Qin.(221-207 BC.)I had always admire Jiang Wen , and his cute,playful,fiercesome and brutal protrayal of the emperor is wonderful. Ge You is also great and comical at times. Ge You have won the International film festival best actor award twice.One for "To Live" the other for "Keep Cool". Both movies by Zhang Yimou.The movies includes epic warfare, love, betrayal, friendship, stubborness, punishment, executions, tortures and power. Anything you should expect from and ancient epic, is all here.The relationship of the two men in this movie is complicated, fascinating and touching. Full of emotions and feelings.The entire movie from the beginning to the end are filled with gorgeous image and unbelivable scenarios. The opening sequence left me absolutely Speechless. The middle sequences left me in awe and terror and the final sequences left me in tears.The Emperor's Shadow is a tremendous hit here in Asia.Do not believe some of the US critics who down grade this film. From what I've read, some doesnt understand the culture and the history and some are political minded. See it for yourself and you decide.Trust me. We, here in Asia knows best.We came from our ancient ancestors of The Xia dynasty - ca.2000-1800 BC thru Qin,Han,Xin,Genghiz Khan to Kublai Khan who formed the Yuan Dynasty, and built the Imperial Palace (Forbidden City) and again thru Ming and finally Qing Dynasty (Empress Dowager Tsu Tzi /Aishin Goro Pu yi of Manchuria) to reach where we are in this modern world today 2001.The Emperor's Shadow is visually sumptuous, with great cinematography and engaging history. Even if you are not a history fan. The movie can be enjoy via its visuals,ceremonies and scenery.
tt0125994;  When exploring the Asian epics it is wonderful to find out that all the critics and the general ideas are wrong. First of all, not all Asian pictures are filled with martial arts nonsense. Far from it, I'd say.And here is a truely great epic. It has been compared with Kurosawa's RAN, which is rather silly since that film has been made by one of the Founding Fathers of cinema, and also with BRAVEHEART, which comes pretty close.Somehow this film keeps the mind spinning, the wonderful stories of Jorge Luis Borges about this First Chinese Emperor twists and turns in the back of the mind. The refusal of using too bright a' colours in wardrobe keeps you asking why we needed all these glistening colours with Bertolucci's tale of the LAST EMPEROR anyway.Is this epic true to history ? I really couldn't tell. It might be... I do know it is a wonderful lush film, and within its grand scale it has found a way to talk about the small yet important things. It is a gorgeous epic, and romantic without the silliness we westerners usually mix in our grand stories...  
tt0125994;  When Zang Xiao Ping died three years ago at the age of 91, Richard Holdbrooke, the US Ambassador to the UN said that he will be remembered as relentlessly trying to bring a long-lasting period of peace, away from food famines, war, instability, financial dependence to foreign nations.  The king in this motion picture, while claims that a national anthem will conquer hearts and minds of the eventually united kindoms that make China, also ponders on unifying scales and measures, trade protocols, language. Interesting parallel with modern-day China of Zang, the king's daughter is cripple from a fall off a horse.  Zang's son was crippled from a fall off a window in the late sixties trying to escape the Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution.  
tt0172811; A tragical comedy. Very worth watching - it's a story about politics and church, leading rural family life after the WW2 in Slovenija, producing comedy, ending in a tragic realization of the ways of the politics, taking down the naive, ignorant and innocent.The movie is very well at showing the rural life after World War 2 and the Communist Revolution. The State first takes the land owned by the Church and the Kulaks (landlords) away and divides it among the peasant families, allowing them to work on their own for the first time in their lives. Shortly after that, nationalization takes place, resulting in taking the land from the peasants and creating 'state-owned land'. The main character, JoÂ<U+009E>a, returns to his home village from serving in the WW2 as a Partisan, where he was caught by the Germans from whom he escaped and then joined the Soviet Forces, serving 'Stalin'. He and his family are later being treated differently by the State, depending on the Diplomatic Status, Yugoslavia-Tito, had with the Soviet Union-Stalin. He is first, treated as a hero and his children are being awarded from the local authorities, but when Tito turned away from Stalin, he is being treated as a traitor.'Sometimes, it's better to play stupid.' A great Slovenian movie! 
tt0405699;  A few years ago "Antikiller" by Yegor Konchalovsky was a nice surprise for Russian audience worldwide, because it combined both Holywood-style filming and lots of Russian humor. But since then the creators wanted to make some extra money, so they came up with a sequel. Unlike the first part, the plot in Antikiller2 is less realistic and unoriginal - good guys fight terrorism. Still it displays how selfless actions of single officers are futile because of corruption in higher levels of command.It still has some humor, but it also has a lot of hidden advertisements, like Samsung cell phones, which are shown at lest 50 times during the movie. The movie has some morale, and the main idea is that fighting Chechen terrorists is useless unless the whole society fights the common enemy, however, the idea is not developed in the plot as good as it was in "Voina" or "Brat". 7/10.  
tt0405699;  I disagree with the previous comment on all counts. First of all I like how the movie is shot, particularly the camera angles for the action scenes. It's a welcome change from the Hong Kong clichA© which makes an emphasis on specific moves. Antikiller is not an instructional Martial Art video. But it's close-ups in my opinion more truly capture the atmosphere of the fight - this is what you'd see if you were in the midst of the action.And secondly I am convinced that the movie movie is clearly anti-terrorist - it obviously portrays terrorists as criminals and savages. Yet it tries, and in my opinion succeeds, to paint the objective picture - there are different kinds of people in every group. There are corrupt police, patriotic thieves and non-criminal Chechens - fighters for idea. This is life. And if somebody expects good guys to win every fight - they should be watching cartoons. Personally I found the "happy end" in which both the main hero and his wife survive, to be the least realistic part of the whole move. I think that script writers needed it for a sequel.  
tt0405699;  This is one very disappointing movie! The director is too young, his work is amateurish, grotesque and very inexperienced. Lame camera work: these people tried to be original in their use of camera angles and camera movement. They really failed at both. The movie is hard to watch (literally bad for your eyes), all action sequences are hidden behind the jagged motion of the camera. Maybe they chose this filming style because the action sequences were badly engineered and directed, I do not really know.The reason why I decided to write a review here is because of the plot and the idea carried by the movie. I suspect the budget for this film came from Chechen terrorists and their financiers. They make the terrorists into the real good guys and heroes, while between the lines they hint as at the idea that the law enforcement people and Russian state anti-terrorist groups are the true bad guys.Obvious example: at the end (spoiler follows!) the main terrorist character completely overpowers and badly beats up the 'good guy', showing us that he really is the good guy and Chechens are better and stronger 'men' than Russians. The 'good guy' can take the terrorist out only with the help of a tricky disabled gun and a big truck. The director also highlights in the movie that Muslim terrorists do not support violence (the terrorist father disapproving the torture video of Christian people by Muslim mercenaries).All in all, I was really disappointed in the movie. My advice: do not waste your money and time watching this flick.

tt0425186; I've never read the novel on which this movie is based but I bet it's miles better than its visual rendition. The fact that I'm the first to comment here could help to understand how many people have seen it: a few, I guess, including me!. The main problem of this movie can be easily resumed by this expression: 'there's less than meets the eye'. We have a college of female orphans raised in strict discipline apparently for the sole purpose of dancing and be one day chosen by a not better defined 'prince' as the 'star of the ballet' and gain his 'particular attention'. They ignore everything about their real origins and live almost segregated from outer world. As the coming of age approaches the idyllic mood vanishes and some of the girls start wonder about their condition and found what should not be found: their headmistress is a psycho capable of horrible things, even kill, to preserve the secret that lies behind the existence of the college itself. The absurd thing is that we never know what the secret is! But there are plenty of such incongruences throughout the whole story... The direction fails, in my opinion, to follow a precise line and what we see is a lot of rudimentary sub-plots not sufficiently developed. A story about a 'sentimental education' seen from a lesbian side turns into something darker and Gothic over a badly defined environment we hardly recognize as Austria, early 20th century. Don't waste your time with this title: highly NOT recommended. 
tt0425186; This film, based on a novella by Frank Wedekind, which we read a long time ago, suffers the too-many-cooks-spoil-the-broth syndrome. Being a co-production of England, Italy and the Czech Republic doesn't help the strange mishmash this film turned out to be. To add insult to injury, the finished product suffers from a case of an atrocious dubbing, which can be quite maddening on the viewer who is paying close attention to the expressions of the actors against what is being said by them at any given moment. Since the dialog is in Italian, and many in the cast don't speak the language, the result is disorienting, to say the least.The story of a girls' orphanage makes an intriguing premise. The institution serves as the home for those who have been unfortunate enough to land in it. The girls are being groomed in ballet dancing, mainly. There is a certain degree of mystery about the provenance of these beautiful young women which is not quite easy to grasp until one adventurous girl, Vera, who has been slighted by the ballet mistresses into a secondary spot in the corps, that she decides to engage Irene and Hidalla, to help her. This proves to be a fatal mistake, as things begin to unravel around them.Jacqueline Bisset appears as the headmistress with a secret of her own. Mary Nighy and Hannah Taylor-Gordon are seen as Hidalla and Irene, they share also a passion that will get them in trouble. Nataalia Tena plays Vera, the girl who discovers where the records of the girls are being kept and pays a high prize for it. Enrico Loverso, an excellent Italian actor, has nothing to do in the film.The best thing in the movie is the cinematography of Fabio Zamarion, who takes advantage of the great old structure where the action takes place, as well as the bucolic surrounding area photographed somewhere in the Czech Republic. Director John Irvin, who evidently was involved for a long time in the project, emphasizes the homoerotic aspects of the story as well as more gory details. 
tt0425186; The title, cover and plot of the movie are totally misleading: sentimental education of young girls. That suggests an interesting and maybe sensual tinted story about girls in a boarding school. However, it's nothing but a cruel thriller, with unended plots. Nothing in the whole story leads to anything, except more cruelty, killing and crudeness. The mine-haha waterfall has no function in the story whatsoever. The only ambition of the director is to shock. If you're interested in physical, psychological and sexual violence, by all means go rent it. If you're looking forward to a good plot with sensual elements, skip this. 
tt0425186; *** NO SPOILERS IN THE FIRST PART OF MY REVIEW ***"The Fine Art of Love" looks like a film from the past, from the 20th century -- and that's a good thing. It is an example of masterful, unpretentious, adult filmmaking, so very different from the superhero-, action-, romantic-comedy- and art-house-trash that is flooding our cinemas nowadays.Unlike "Innocence" (2004), Lucile Hadzihalilovic's fine adaptation of Wedekind's novel, that stayed quite close to the source material (failing only, obviously for budgetary reasons, in conveying Wedekind's spectacular closing sequence), "The Fine Art of Love" takes liberties, creating a new storyline, turning it into more of a horror story, but still based on the setting and atmosphere of the original novel.Irvin's film moves at a steady pace, never hastening, never lingering, accompanied by a beautiful, never intrusive musical score. The cast is perfect, full of unforgettable faces and powerful performances (some commentator here complained about the dubbing, I didn't notice it at all, however I have to say that I come from Germany, where people are familiar with dubbing and it doesn't bother them as long as it is well done). The film looks great, as you would expect when you have Dante Ferretti in charge of production design.*** SPOILERS START ***The title sequence already sums up the film perfectly: We see two feet in ballet slippers, dancing en pointe, while blood from the tortured toes is slowly seeping through the shoes. Seeing it in close up, you can feel the pain, and you want it to stop, but it doesn't stop. You start to hate the music, the beautiful music: It's the same melody still, but it seems cynical now, sadistic. You want the pitiless music to stop, so the feet can stop dancing. But it doesn't stop, it goes on and on and on, while the blood keeps flowing...That is how the story works: Something terrible happens, then another terrible thing happens, and you want it to stop, you desperately want someone to stand up and stop it, put an end to it. But who can do it? The few good men an women in the story (the kind young teacher, the idealistic police inspector, finally Hidalla the firestarter) don't stand a chance against the powerful forces of evil. When I saw the film for the first time, I found the ending to be one of the most devastating endings I have ever experienced in the cinema: When the flames started licking in the theatre, I felt so relieved, I thought "finally, the whole cursed place is going to be consumed" -- how big was my shock when I had to learn that it was not over yet.You may see "The Fine Art of Love" (what a wonderfully cynical title for this story, by the way) as just an unusual horror film, taking advantage of the much-loved setting of a girl's boarding school. For me, it is much more: A desperate cry of disgust in the face of a world that is corrupt, built on lies and hypocrisy, where money and power are substitutes for love and life, where the spirits, and ultimately the lives, of the young are broken and destroyed. It is the world we still live in today. 
tt0425186; I loved this film! I can understand why some people would have a few issues with it, as it is quite violent and disturbing in some parts, but I see it as a truly remarkable story.The film takes place in the early 20th Centry, Thuringia, Germany in an orphanage for girls in the middle of nowhere. The girls have no idea where they come from,and don't have any idea about what life is like outside the strict orphanage. However, soon enough, some of the girls start asking questions that can lead to fateful consequences...I loved the eeriness of it, it made it more compelling to watch. The sets and cinematography were outstanding. Brilliant performances by most of the cast, but particularly by Hannah Taylor Gordon (Irene) who I thought was incredible in it.I thought the love story and friendship between Irene and Hidalla was very sweet and a little moving at times. The love story distracts from the gruesome plot line, however I think this is a good thing because it gives the audience something else to focus on.The only thing I found disappointing in this movie was the tragic and disturbing ending. IF YOU DON'T LIKE SAD MOVIES, THEN DON'T WATCH THIS.But overall, a good movie, which I would gladly watch again. 
tt0425186; This is a very "wake up and pay attention" sort of movie. Definitely not for the narrow minded or faint hearted. The movie will leave you cold, but at the same time is worth watching. The acting is very well done and very well directed. The love scenes are not often and not discomforting. In fact the love between Irene and Hidalla is touching and sweet.There is a great deal of violence in this movie and it is incredibly fast paced. Mary Nighy, Hannah Taylor Gordon and Jacquiline Bisset give outstanding performances which make the movie worth watching. Sad story. But a very good movie.But if you are not sensitive to violence and wish to see this movie I would highly recommend it. It is actually brilliant if watched carefully. Similar movies include,Magdelene Sisters, Girl Interuppted and Boys Don't Cry. Disturbing, but very good. Well done to all the actors. 
tt0425186; This is quite a shocking movie and crude. Shows the real side of life...no fairy tales added, straight to the point. Shows what girls had to go through and the anonymity of themselves - not knowing who they are, how they got to be there or even where they are. The school is he only thing they know. They find refuge within themselves, they are each other's family. This movie shows us the consequences to each of the girls' actions. The love story is amazing. We see the deep love the girls have for each other and it being the only thing they have to hold on to. This movie shows us that love doesn't always last forever and that it doesn't overcome obstacles. Shows us the cruel lives that these girls had to live. Amazing movie. 
tt1971466; I watched this wonderful Korean animation with my mum and by the end we were both uncontrollably crying.A short little plot of the movie: A hen escapes the barn and somehow becomes the 'mother' to a duckling, they bond beautifully but later their differences create tension and conflict.This movie has a nice soundtrack and the vibrant colours and settings of nature are really appropriate for a kids movie but this is so much more!The pictures sort of have an anime feel in the action scenes and is usually accompanied by music for highly emotional scenes. It's hard not to feel your heart sink at these moments. If you want your kids to watch it with you then be warned: there will be tears so be careful not to take the little little ones so that they aren't wailing about how sad and yet beautiful the ending is.The post-movie feelings are hard to describe because you can't help feel that it should've ended better in terms of the story line but I think that's what the real preciousness of the movie is, it really captures the rareness of ultimate love and sacrifice that you really have to appreciate what happens. A definite must-watch and I assure you watching it as a family is incredible. 
tt1971466; Anyone who ever had, or ever was a loving mother owes it to him or herself to watch this masterpiece of Korean animation.This is definitely one of the most touching, poignant movie I've ever had the pleasure to see. It will hit straight into your heart and awoken feelings you forgot you could experience.Everything from the vibrant art style, flawless animation, well structured narrative, good balance of humor and drama and brilliantly orchestrated score brings this movie to a state of perfection few other animated features have achieved before.Little warning to parents: Leafie deals with some pretty heavy stuff. I mean, you should definitely go watch it with your older kids, but the younger ones should probably sit this one out. It was, after all, based on a book for preteens and contains scenes of violence (don't worry, nothing too graphic, and this is definitely NOT one of those hyper-violent mindless summer blockbuster) and some heavy emotional investment that might not be suitable to younger audiences.In brief: I recommend Leafie heartily to everyone, it's a definitive must-watch, but be ready to cry a river. 
tt1971466; People seem to think this is original, but it is much like Doggie Poo and the English dubbing is painful at best. I really wanted the hen to get killed off pretty early on. She is pretty much a very dim stalker. I watched it and just thought of movies like Single White Female. As far as being more real, not at all, you want a hardcore animation, Watershed Down, Plague Dogs, When the Wind Blows, or any number or movies. This one was very basic and half though out. I had chickens far braver than this one and far smarter. This movie just bugged me on so many levels. It was like "are you my mom" but if the mom had no clue if she was, or like the ugly duckling if the duckling's mother was a psycho chicken. Young kids may like it, but nothing was good in this film other than some animation. There is far better Korean animation out there. Also I just watched Song of the Sea and I was a bit sad during parts of it, but this movie had me looking at the clock and never once felling any emotion (and as I said I had both chickens and ducks as a kid and think there were fun to have around). 
tt1971466; Leafie looks nothing like any American animated film. It carries out its story in a way unlike American animation as well. American animated movies are almost always kids' movies, and there's an implication that the story and characters should be similarly childish.Leafie, hailing from South Korea and based on a South Korean novel called "The Hen Who Dreamed She Could Fly", doesn't seem interested in stooping to the six-year-old demographic. There's a lot in the movie for kids to love, but it's also a bit scary, and the story isn't as neat and orderly as one expects from a kids' movie. Leafie is bittersweet, like real life, which makes it both interesting and hard to watch. Tears were in my eyes at one point, although I never started sobbing.Leafie the hen was born on a farm but wants to escape. Over time she has a child of her own who has different abilities than her. It's frustrating for mother and son that they are different enough for the other animals to make fun of them. Parenthood and belonging are major themes, "Leafie" is a blend of Animal Farm, Finding Nemo, and a little bit of The Lion King.It's all a bit predictable. Some parts throw you for a loop but it's usually not that hard to guess correctly about what's going to happen next.There are some brief jokes involving toilet humor, which weren't done in a clever enough way to make me appreciate them. They're more explicit than the toned-down toilet jokes you find in Finding Nemo or The Lion King, which is probably why I found them so distasteful.I appreciate seeing an animated movie that doesn't look like the homogenized "Pixar / Dreamworks / Disney / Sony" style. Vibrant colors abound, and it seems like the movie was animated mostly using two- dimensional techniques. It never made me as happy as "Ernest & Celestine" did, and I liked the way that movie looked even more than this one, but "Ernest" was never as sad as "Leafie" either.Although the movie always looks *different*, it doesn't always make the best use of its style. Very few scenes blew me away with their visual style: Frozen, The Lion King, Ernest & Celestine, and Wall-E have "Leafie" beat when it comes to beautiful artwork.I'm glad I watched this, there are too many sequels and too little heart in American animated movies. Characters don't have the nuance they do in Finding Nemo, and there's not enough humor to hold together the passable, but touching plot.I suggest watching it in HD - it was released on Blu-Ray in South Korea (Region A) and Germany (B). But once you're done, look up the original ending. It's a mandatory part of the experience, and it's a shame that they cut it from the film. You'll understand why it was cut once you watch it, but it contains major spoilers, so wait until you watch the movie first. 
tt1971466; This movie is absolutely beautiful. Taking it as it is, it's visually appealing, has it's quirky and cute moments, and just overall touches your heart. It's everything you'd expect from an animated movie.That being said, it does take on some more adult themes, however I feel like it would appeal to people of all ages, 3 year old's and 40 year old's alike.This movie beautifully touches on the troubles of a female who becomes a mother in lieu of the unfortunate circumstance that is nature and all its dangers. Her love for the child and wish to raise a child of her own puts her on the path to raising a baby who's nothing like her. The movie proceeds to touch on how hard and how rewarding parenthood can be, the good, the bad, and the ugly, especially when your children grow old enough to fly the coop and you're left to remember all the beautiful times they gave you.This movie also displays the selflessness of the female, as well as her determination to protect a child that's nothing like her and not even hers, while in turn aiding someone else in need of protecting their children. This message is beautiful for kids, as well as it is for teens or adults.TL,DR: I HIGHLY suggest you watch this, whether in the original Korean version with English subs, or the English dubbed version. It's a rewarding experience that has highs, lows and enjoyable moments. This movie is just one of those warm, memorable movies. I guarantee you'll remember it years from now even after only watching it once. 
tt1971466; A simple heart moving story.I was initially hesitant to see a South Korean movie with English subtitles. But I am glad I did. It is a story which will make you feel emotions that you forgot as one of the reviewers said. The story starts with a poultry hen, Leafie, wanting to be free. Leafie starves herself, so that she faints and is thrown out considered to be dead. She is then attacked by a weasel just to be saved by a duck. She is infatuated only to find him already in a relationship. It is a bumpy ride from there.She happens to mother a duck and takes care of him. When the duckling grows older he rejects her for being different and calls her an abomination. The duckling gets captured by the farmer. Leafie rescues him with her friends. The duckling then starts understanding her love.Don't forget to watch the ending and have a lot of tissues handy :) 
tt1342403; Jiri Barta returns to film making after a 20 year absence. He also hits one out of the park.This is one of the surprises of the New York International Children's Film Festival. I didn't expect to like this but I did. Actually other than it losing its way in the last 10 minutes this is a wonderful film.The best way to describe this is Toy Story meets Princess Bride.When the big head in the land of evil gets designs on Buttercup he sets a plan in motion to steal her. Its then up to her friends to find away to get her back.Its amazing. Its wonderful stop motion magic. Just track this down, its great. 
tt1342403; Jiri Barta's amazing new film is not just a masterpiece of animation: It's a celebration of imagination and invention! Discarded items, from antique toys to rotten potatoes, take on a life of their own when discarded in the attic of a Czech home during the Cold War. Repurposed and re-imagined into new tasks and roles, Barta's vision explodes with enchanting creativity and visual splendor. This newly created, English-Adaptation ads new dimension to the film with terrific performances from a stellar voice cast, and an informative new opening sequence which describes some back history of the principal characters. TOYS IN THE ATTIC is truly an amazing film not to be missed while it's on the big screen! 
tt1342403; Imagine how it would be if a filmmaker like Jan Â<U+008A>vankmajer decided to make one day a remake of "Toy Story". I'm pretty sure that the result would be easily something like this.Even when (by concept, at least)"Toys in the Attic" is a kid's movie, it still has plenty of surreal and weird scenes which seem to be quite uncommon in this kind of films (At least, in the Hollywood kid's flicks)However, considered that it was directed by JiA<U+0099>A­ Barta (Who is also the same director of the magnificent "KrysaA<U+0099>", an incredibly dark version of the "Pied Piper of Hamelin" fairytale) that shouldn't surprise me, specially considering that Barta and Â<U+008A>vankmajer share more than a common element in all their work, a unique quality that made each film and short directed by them a fascinating and surreal experience.And obviously, this movie isn't the exception of that rule. I enjoyed it a lot, but I'm sure that adult viewers will appreciate it more than the kids (In fact, I'm sure that a couple of scenes from this movie could easily scare some little children. Or perhaps they will find this boring, something which is a shame) I highly recommend this movie tor anyone who is interested to see a kid 's film told from other kind of perspective. 
tt2106440; First off, how in the world did this get "5.0" points? Must be from the lame actors. Secondly, this movie was really really bad.I watched this because I believe Danielle Harris still has it in her to become a great horror actress and seeing this movie coming out, I wanted to watch it. I did not want to watch the trailer for the fact that it can ruin movies for me. In that instance, I have made a very bad error. This movie, was so awful, the acting was similar to 3rd graders, that I had a HARD time watching it past the first 15 minutes.From the beginning, you can tell how this movie would go and I found myself skipping most scenes. Not only is it predictable, the acting is horrendous, the "killings" are an ABSOLUTE JOKE, I was laughing at most of them, as you can definitely see the dummies that were covered in blood in what was to be a "body".The end scene of the movie, the lady dies a painful, almost laughable death. That part humored me because it was so lame.PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE for your sanity and for the precious time you have on this earth, do not watch this unless you are either high or very drunk. AVOID!!For the Phantom Stranger: THIS MOVIE IS SO BAD! THERE IS NOTHING GOOD THAT CAN COME FROM THIS HORRID MOVIE. You are most likely the actor or the producer trying to brainwash most people out of their money. All I have to say is....LET them be the judge on HOW HORRID this laughable, brain dead movie really is. I watch ALL types of horror, and there are BAD ones, there are GOOD BAD ones, and there are GREAT BAD ones. This one is so HORRID, I felt my IQ drop... Folks, I will let you be the judge of it, and Phantom stranger? start making better movies. 
tt2106440; It plays like one of those movies that would be featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000...the scenes are laughable and filled with stereotypes. The acting is somewhat decent but again reeks of student film project from the high school-type writing of the script to the film quality. The sexual fantasy scene was thrown in there to keep your attention, otherwise most would have stopped watching. From one gory scene to the next, people are picked off by this uninteresting "killer" that lacks any sort of suspense...if you want the gore and entertainment you would be better off watching Texas Chainsaw Massacre or some other gore fest. 
tt2106440; If there is any credit to be given, then it is to whomever chose to use nice camera and not HD phone cam to film this :) Honestly, that's just about only way I can think of at this time that this movie could have been worse.Kids at start can be excused for being bad actors. I cant make such excuse for rest of the cast. Acting is wooden throughout entire film.Casting is bad as every actor is just too plain and unmemorable. What should be young adults are bit too old looking for their roles, and look more like crowd of couch potatoes, in bad shape, slightly overweight. In other words what you would expect bunch of people in early 30's to perhaps look like, if they chose not to take care of themselves, or had kids and did not lose baby weight. Not people in early 20's that I assume they are supposed to be.Script is terrible. Its what bunch of drunk frat boys might have come up with, while intoxicated. I watched this movie with bunch of people and nobody laughed at any point in the movie.Sometimes I enjoy a bad movie. You know, B movie that is meant to be bad and that is its appeal. This is not one of those movies. Its just boring and predictable in unfun way, where everything takes too long to happen.That's about it. I would not suggest this movie to anybody, for any reason. 
tt2106440; The story is badly done. The acting is community playhouse caliber. The only reason I watched this was for Danielle Harris. I'm sure the filmmaker knows her value, but she's really only one of an ensemble cast. It would seem more reasonable to have her as the big star of the movie.I think the story is the killer seeking revenge for a girl who was bullied to death years earlier. I say I think because the characters are poorly defined. I didn't care about any of them. The actors read their lines like amateurs, and the characters are all douchy idiots. The only reason I like the kills is to shut them up. The bloody effects are also pretty amateurish. Some of it is laughable.I guess everybody has to start somewhere. This Sean McGarry is starting at the bottom here. There isn't much interesting to grasp onto. Killing people in one of those Halloween scare-arama has some promise. It just needs somebody better to figure out how to do it right. 
tt2106440; A handful of mean teenagers pull a nasty Halloween prank on a girl with a stutter that results in the poor lass being facially and emotionally scarred for life. Ten years later the folks responsible for this terrible incident receive a brutal comeuppance on Hallows' Eve. While director Sean McGarry delivers oodles of graphic gore and a satisfying smidgen of tasty gratuitous female nudity (gorgeous brunette Katie Griffith as the abrasive Susan bares her exquisitely bountiful breasts while masturbating in a bathtub and some mystery babe pops up for a totally ridiculous and unnecessary dream scene), McGarry alas crucially fails to generate much in the way of tension or spooky atmosphere. Worse yet, Raymond Mamrak's sloppy script suffers from an appalling lack of focus and cohesion: It's not only impossible to figure out who's supposed to be who amongst the guilty, but also the wonky timeline likewise is totally off (kids who were in their teens in the past look like they're pushing thirty in the present!). Moreover, the tin-eared profanity-ridden dialogue drops the f-bomb way too much and the irritating and obnoxious villains of the piece don't get bumped off fast enough. On the plus side, several cast members manage to do commendable work: Veteran scream queens Danielle Harris as the sweet Nicole Bates and Tiffany Shepis as the feisty Sarah contribute typically solid pro turns, Courtney Baxter makes a favorable impression as the fragile and vulnerable Eve Bates, and Ashley C. Williams of "The Human Centipede" bitches it up well as the snarky Ashley. In addition, the Halloween hayride setting gets put to pretty good use. Joseph Hennigan's passable cinematography unfortunately uses annoying fades at the end of a handful of scenes, but overall does the trick. However, Dan Dixon's redundant shivery score proves to be sheer torture on the ears. A disappointing slice'n'dicer. 
tt2106440; To begin with, there are only two other reviews for this film at the time of this writing and both give it a 1 rating. As in the worst possible score any movie can be rated on IMDb. The people giving this a one rating must not have seen very many low budget movies. I would suggest for them to take a look at IMDb's Bottom 100. There may be other ways to get there, but I just scroll to the bottom of IMDb's homepage and click on Top Movies link. From there you will see a link on the left side of your screen that says IMDb Bottom 100. Now just pick out a few of those titles that sound interesting to you, find yourself a copy somewhere (just don't pay too much for them, or better yet, see if a friend has any of them so you don't have to pay at all), try to watch them until the end and then reassess this film properly. I'll even give you a few examples of some films to watch for this assignment: BIRDEMIC: SHOCK AND TERROR (2010), DISASTER MOVIE (2008), ZOMBIE NATION (2004), and HOUSE OF THE DEAD (2003). You will see that there are movies much worse than what you thought this one was. You just need some perspective.Now onto the film at hand. For a reported budget of $300k, I feel this movie did very well. I may be somewhat biased because of two names in this film. Danielle Harris and the always beautiful Tiffany Shepis (who I wish would have had much more screen time). Both did very well in their limited parts, as expected. It's not everyday that one gets to see two of their favorite horror scream queens on the same screen. The rest of the cast was spotty, but acceptable. Courtney Baxter was looking very lovely too, even with her disfigured face. Matthew Nadu (Joe) and Stephen Medvidick (Rudy) did good as well. I wasn't sure about the character of Rudy to begin with, but he grew on me over the course of the film and did really well helping to carry this movie along. Some of the sets were a little cheap (Aberzombie & Twitch), but overall the haunted farm-like setting was decent, nothing too elaborate but good for the limited budget. I enjoyed this film and in the end it wasn't just because of the limited presence of Danielle Harris and Tiffany Shepis. The story was a bit weak but passable, as were the kills. Better than represented here on IMDb thus far. A solid 6 in my book for what the filmmakers were able to achieve with a very limited budget. 
tt2106440; Sometimes I agree with some low ratings. But sometimes people's ratings Are just completely so far out of whack it isn't even funny. They are so off that I don't even think a new one would fix the problem. It is more likely the person behind the scale. People come on here and throw one's around like they are like it is their first time at the strip club. Honestly, this is not the Worst movie you will ever see. I promise you... Not even close. If it is, then I am really sorry for you. I wonder the what the three worst movies you saw Before this was.But I am not here to attack people who rate movies ones. I just really feal like It really does throw some people off of movies that they may have actually liked. Now maybe this movie isn't one of em'. Maybe other People won't like this Either. But it ain't no 1. I actually I agree with another poster. For a low-budget Film this was a pretty decent film. And I really like Danielle Harris. She definitely Wasn't in the movie enough. But the movie had a good plot, little mystery in it, had its share of blood, and the setting that the movie took place in was cool. The only thing it really lacked was money for some big time production. But for What they had, they pulled it off pretty damn good. Definitely your lower level average horror movie. 5-6 but definitely watchable! 
tt2106440; Hallow's Eve is a pretty cool late night horror flick. I really enjoyed the Halloween haunted fun house theme. Im a huge Danielle Harris and Tiffany Shepis fan, so i was excited to check this out, even though i saw this movie was distributed by Barnholtz entertainment. The plot was pretty easy to follow, a group of friends get invited to a small towns annual Halloween haunted country theme park. These friends years before were involved in a cruel prank that leaves a young girl severely injured and hal of her face disfigured. Now as a teen, she helps her family operate the haunted house attractions. As the night goes on, the responsible teens begin to be killed off. This revenge slasher is one of those where the killer is unmasked in the end. I found it pretty cool that people touring the attractions was convinced some the bodies were fake, when they were actually being killed. Not much of a twist to the killers identity though. And the kills were pretty graphic. Good set design also. This movie was fun, its worth at least a watch. 
tt1598172; Whilst the lead guy does have solid presence it wasn't until half way though that I realised this was some cheap b grade rubbish. All the mafiosi tropes are here from makin da bolognese sauce to getting gunned down at a restaurant to the rat to revenge to you get the idea. The soundtrack shifted the tone so wildly that it gives you the feeling of different editors. They should have stuck to the gritty rock stuff instead of Italian arias at the hit whilst everyone does in slow mo...I kid you not. All of it reeks of some student effort: Constant time shifts...excessive narration...useless scenes. The lead tough guy guy crying while he jerks off?! lol Looks like a tax loss production to me 
tt1598172; The film is an interesting mix of family drama and mafia movie. It balances the two quite well and plays an entertaining part in the conflict. The relationship especially between the father and son juxtaposed with the relationship of the small gang is done nicely. And the ending is especially my favorite part. Overall, I think it is a decent film and is well worth the watch. Yes, there were some things I wasn't particularly fond of such as the lack of violence I was expecting but it was still a decent film. If you don't like mafia movies then obviously this isn't the movie for you. But if you are partial to them, I would say to give this one a shot. 
tt1598172; I had no idea what to expect when I saw this film, but I was thoroughly surprised at what I got. I really enjoyed this movie, it reminds me of the good old days in Brooklyn. Exactly what a gangster movie should be, great cast, the acting was spot on, and it brings a ton of action to the screen. With a true ensemble cast, you get grade A acting. I have no idea how they got so many good actors in one film, but the end result was really good. I also have to say the cinematography was great as well. This is the new generation of gangster films! If you like this genre, it's a must see.The motorcycle shooting scene was awesome! I highly recommend! 
tt1598172; A friend of mine suggested I see this movie. I understood why she did after seeing it. The lead actor blew me away. He had incredible presence. I love the bad boys. Especially ones that can make you root for them. I thought the movie sent a very nice message of what is really important. I will be watching out for William DeMeo. I really enjoyed watching him from the opening scene. The scenes with his father Armand Assante were very good. I felt the compassion they felt for each other. Assante still has what it takes. The scene where he rips into his son towards the end of the movie is breath taking. I thought the movie had enough action for the story told and I felt all the supporting characters were very believable. If you are a fan of this genre. You won't be disappointed. I will be looking out for the future films of this director Paul Borghese. 
tt1866919; This is a film that isn't going to be what many viewers had in mind. You will not get your typical Ray Winstone film here, not in any form you've seen him in his prior roles. It's a tale of a son who has lost contact with his father for some time & begins to search him out. The film almost immediately starts with this goal being achieved, finding his Alzheimer ridden father at a nearby mental hospital in vary poor shape prone to very violent outbursts & unpredictability. The son is quick to break him out knowing full well it's not a good idea and leaves it's audience weary of his overall motives. There is much confusion and zero comedy as just keeping the son's father in tow is a serious problem. As the third act begins a twist is laid out bringing new life to a very depressing mood. It's well acted & filmed so no problems in that area, but I stand to believe many will find this not to be a very pleasing watch. It is listed correctly as a drama although I was kind of hoping for more action. There is a small dose towards the end. I would recommend this, but only to those that are aiming for a story driven drama which brings me to the rating of 5/10 
tt1866919; Main reason for review is the change of genre for Ray Winstone who usually plays the cockney bad guy with relish to find him playing an Alzheimer's sufferer taken from the typical home on a road trip is surprising but he plays the role superbly, I knew he was good at what he normally played but this role showed his ability far more than previous roles I am happy to praise his performance as someone who years ago cared for these patients he is so realistic in the role I was shocked. It's not a happy film and I would rewrite the ending but stress Ray Winstone's performance is really worth watching, hope he does more work outside of his usual genre. 
tt1866919; Most people will be more familiar with Ray Winstone as 'tough-guy' characters, so perhaps that's one reason he's decided to take a break from 'busting heads' and started to show the viewers that he's got more of a 'sensitive' side.In Ashes, he plays an Alzheimer sufferer who gets 'kidnapped' by his son from the hospital he's been committed to and then taken on a roadtrip across England. Why? Well, that's something you have to find out.The first thing you need to is that this certainly isn't a 'feel-good' film. It's dark, nasty and certainly not light-hearted in any way. Its major plus-point is Ray Winstone. He plays the part perfectly, switching from scared bouts of violence, to just plain scared. He's the reason this film is worth watching, as the 'story' is somewhat lacking. I was left wondering why exactly these two were driving across country, as it isn't really explained until about the hour mark. Although, that is the time when the film generally starts to pick up.The first hour - excluding Ray's performance - is pretty hard to sit through. It doesn't really go anywhere and drags by. However, if you can excuse that, it does get better and the last act ties everything up.If you're a fan of Ray then you'll enjoy this. Otherwise, you'll have to be in the mood for a very dark drama to get something out of this. 
tt1866919; This is an unusual film that straddles a few genres. It's filmed on a relatively small budget but as so often is the case outperforms films with much higher budget. Ray Winstone is an interesting and charismatic actor and he does a great job in this as a man suffering from the crippling effects of Alzheimer's. Jim Sturgess provides excellent support as his seemingly concerned son. The film can get quite confusing as it switches from drama to thriller and back again but this is to be applauded. You never quite know where it is heading and that makes a pleasant change from many predictable films in these genres. There are moments of real emotion and some nice twists of plot. This is a well directed and acted British film and is highly recommended. 
tt1866919; Ray Winstone is one of my favourite British actors, and usually brightens up even the most dour of motion pictures. Here though, his role is a very confused one... On the one hand, he's a mentally ill dementia sufferer who sees delusions, and on the other he remembers things from his past, such as stealing cars and killing people. I thought Dustin Hoffman's Rain Man was slightly unconvincing, but this goes right to the heart of Hollywood Illnesses. He's too hysterical and too knowing, so alas, you always know you're watching a performer rather that than a very sick man.A cross between a road movie and a buddy movie, when the film doesn't focus on Winstone's odd behaviour and hallucinations it tries to build a relationship between him and his erstwhile son. There are touching moments, but a twist late on puts a new slant on things and we wonder just why Winstone's offspring makes some of the decisions he does, and it comes across as poor writing. Ashes is a mediocrity that won't stand out on anyone involved in it's CV, and will probably be yesterday's chip paper very soon after being viewed... 5/10 
tt0109675; As a proud White American I must say that this movie is a powerful structure that requires a tremendous amount of understanding for another culture while swallowing a little pride of my own.For those who think this movie is racist only proves that more movies like this one need to be made. You can't tell a race of people to just move forward if they are not sure where they come from. You can't just say, "Slavery is over! Now go out and be successful," without understanding the conditioning slavery left behind. Economically and internally. Not to mention when African Americans try to reconnect with their past they are constantly bombarded by some of the same Whites who at times, seem a little bit too concerned with keeping this connection at bay, as if it were a threat of some sort. Meanwhile our toddlers are at school learning about their distant past great leaders like Caesar. Thus, encouraging them to be great leaders. While the black toddlers are learning about slavery and their minor, more modern American accomplishments like the creation of peanut butter or the civil rights movement, making their steps of stride smaller, surviving from day to day, check to check, with hopes of purchasing an apartment or a car as a major accomplishment.Why are we afraid for African Americans to learn they're history? Is it because there were some Black leaders greater than Whites. Is it because most of our history might be tainted with a lot of lies and cover up? If we Whites really want to be Equal (and not just announce it all the time) then we will encourage more Blacks to become one with their distant past. And if it puts some of Europeans most powerful parts in history to the background then so what? We didn't have a problem when we where in the forefront, so why would it matter now if we're in the background? If we truly aren't racist, it shouldn't matter at all. One thing Hollywood and our school system shows us is that Europeans have done great things. But not all great things. And maybe, not even the greatest. But that in itself proposes a powerful question. What if Africans have done greater things, would we be willing to accept that? The truth is, we all know we won't. Does the psychological scar of racism really cuts that deep? 
tt0109675; I believe this film was made w/ its creators knowing that it would be shot down by various "types" of people who'll just simply refuse to look at it objectively. In my opinion, it is a "must see" for everyone aimed particularly at the Black bourgeois. I like the fact that not only does the DROP Squad address the problems of Blacks self-exploiting racial stereotypes for personal financial gain, it also questions the tactics that must be enacted to solve these problems. The aim of the DROP Squad is very provocative but I especially like the human aspect whereas the "Rocky" character debates w/ "XB" and "Garvey" on how to deal w/ the captive individuals to be "dropped." Rocky has a more diplomatic approach that seems to have been more effective back in earlier times around when the group was founded. Seemingly as time has passed and the situation has evolved to crazier proportions, XB and Garvey have resorted to more drastic tactics in order to "get their attention first." I believe what many people fail to realize is that this picture is asking the question "Which, if any, of these methods are more appropriate to addressing this problem?" The tone of the film gets "crazier" as time moves on and the problem gets worse, thus developing the drama where the Squad questions itself altogether. Whether you like this movie or not, you've got to admit that it serves its purpose and that's to "incite dialogue" and not racism. 
tt0109675;  Having just seen Bamboozled, this movie came to mind.  Comparing the two, I think this one was more effective.  The similarities are striking.  In both movies, there are blacks that made it in the establishment, one as an advertisement professional and in the other as a television writer producer. And in both roles, they are enmeshed in producing something for the black audience.  The advertisement professional is soon black listed by his family for having made television advertisements that use stereotypes such as fried chickens and malt liquor, and other parodies of which the family relatives are ashamed and hint of an Al Sharpton's "genocide".  The television production in Bamboozled is protested by Al Sharpton (playing himself). The sponsors of the televion series show ads of fashion clothing, malt liquor ("The Bomb").  While Bamboozled ends in violence, Drop Squad ends with the uppity black returning to his true self, reminded of his own "blackness". In Bamboozled, reflecting the interested by white teenagers in Hip Hop, one member of the rap group is white and is the only survivor of a police shootout ("why me? why me? kill me too!"), and in the followers of the television series is a "Sicilian Nigger", an italo-american that covered his face with blackface and wants to act "black".  Or is it "blak", since we don't need the "C", as one of the rapsters suggests. 
tt0109675; I'll admit that I didn't know of this films existence until a critically acclaimed movie critic went on a rant against it(hint: the same critic that gave Speed 2 a thumbs up). That was enough to make me go out and get it. Drop Squad will not be accepted by the keepers of Status Quo and their token friends but it will most likely be accepted by those that can see past their nose.The story is simple enough: the Drop Squad(Drop is an acronym for Deprogramming and Restoration Of Pride) is group that kidnap ignorant sellout blacks and force them to reconnect with their culture while getting them to realize what they're doing to their people is wrong. Rocky Seavers(Vondie Curtis-Hall) is the leader and has questions about some of the methods that the Drop Squad use on sellouts and begins to bump heads with one of his comrades, Garvey(Ving Rhames) about the methods used. They end up kidnapping corporate clown by the name of Bruford Jamison(Eriq La Salle). From then on Bruford gets flashbacks on all the times he sold out and recalls a crucial moment when he screwed over his own brother Flip(Afemo Omilami)by refusing to come help him out when he tried to get a job at his workplace. The acting is great. Eriq La Salle, Vondie Curtis-Hall and Ving Rhames all turn in some good performances. I like the message of the movie and felt that the scene where Flip confronts Bruford was a touching scene as well as the scene where Rocky talks to Bruford. Closing comments: Drop Squad is a necessary requirement for everybody thats into movies with substance. If the Drop Squad really did exist then I'm glad they did but if they didn't I couldn't be more disappointed especially since we need them now more than ever! Two Thumbs Way Up. 
tt0109675; Although a little heavy handed at times with the central theme, "Drop Squad" is an excellent movie. The characters are developed in a way that uses stereotypes to highlight major issues in the black community with identity and the moral responsibility of its members. It is a well directed film and well worth watching.My only strong criticism of this film is that it requires an active viewer. It is doing a lot and sends a lot of messages. Minor characters are not explained more than brief sound bites and quick flashes on the screen. You have to make an effort to keep up and if you don't pay attention to the details you are going to get lost. I wish the director had spent a little more time developing these characters, especially since it is clear that they are meant to represent elements of the community he means to and does criticize. If the characters were important enough to recap at the end, then they were important enough to explain in the first place. 
tt0109675; I did not know what to expect until I watched this movie for at least a half hour. At first glance it appeared to be a black exploitation movie with a political message of 1970's, with gong-ho mercenaries. Later I realized that the storyline and the underlying message of the film was the same and served as the idea of the more recently filmed Eddie Griffin's comedic version titled "Undercover Brother." This original film was a sad attempt to boost African American pride and its culture with a very bad taste coming out of Hollywood. The movie is demeaning, sarcastic, and disrespectful toward the African American community. It manages to high lite the negative habits and traits prevalent in low income communities, which does not speak highly of the writer(s) and director(s), and their focus while making this low value production. Fortunately, Eddie Griffin was able to put a much better spin on this story and made an enjoyable comedy, as opposed to the original movie's sad attempt. 
tt0109675;  Many top name actors appear in this film.  A must see film for all people! Definitely makes one think about and analyze your own values.  Race is a very strong determining factor in American society and this movie speaks to what it means to be true to yourself.     
tt0109675; It's funny how the previous post left by Violet Weed uses racist statements against Blacks to indicate that Blacks are the racists? It's a shame that this movie wasn't made today, if it was, this topic would've been addressed as well. And that's the topic of whites being so ashamed of what they did, that they are trying to play the role of "victim" in a country that they murdered people to get. (See the irony in that?)You (Violet Weed) stated:Quote: "WE do not MURDER blacks, WE do not impregnate black women and 'force' them to go on welfare. If I can survive on my own from 12 on, so can Anybody. Granted I'm smarter than 99.5% of the world, oh well, still God gifts His/Her children equally, in one way or the other. Get over your 'poor little me' agenda, we ALL face stereotyping and prejudices, the worst one is pretending that MEN rule the world." :Unquote.Lets break this ridiculous statement down, shall we: 1- Whites do not murder blacks? (That's exactly what they did, and cops still do!) 2- Whites do not impregnate black women and 'force' them to go on welfare? (Again, that's EXACTLY what they did when they raped black women and children! And the welfare is forced on them because of poverty. A condition that white America "forced" upon them by erasing their culture, keeping them uneducated and using discrimination that prevented them to grow and build a steady future for today's generation (You know, the generation you have a problem with). 3- If I can survive on my own from 12 on, so can Anybody? (Uh, blacks are STILL here! And even greater than before! There is one even in the white house! So I'd say they are the masters of "surviving". Plus , you are concerned that they are only making pro black movies? Just be happy they are not going around taking massive physical revenge like most oppressed people do. 4- Granted I'm smarter than 99.5% of the world? (Ego much?) 5- Get over your 'poor little me' agenda, we ALL face stereotyping and prejudices, the worst one is pretending that MEN rule the world. (Wow this one is hilarious! you tell Blacks to get over there own "poor little me" agenda and then you create a "poor little me agenda" by stating that "men rule the world". Let me guess, you're an old cranky white feminist? HMM? The perfect "targeted" audience to watch a pro black film!! LMAO!!!!! Oh and BTW, I'm a white male. And a history teacher. I also have a lot of African American friends. I happen to have an open mind and am sensitive to other cultures and their struggles, not just my own. Any individual who is sensitive to other cultures and will appreciate that this is a great, positive film for the black community. 
tt0109675; I only got this movie because I collect movies that are related to the beer and brewing business as part of my breweriana collection. The connection (involving the "Mumblin' Jack Malt Liquor) turned out to be very weak (although I would like one of the 64 oz bottles used as props for my collection).What I got instead was a picture that was a little too real to have you believe it was an attempt at fiction, but too "fake" to have you believe it was real. It was just out there in no man's land.Let's face it, whether it is alcohol and fast food or facial tissue, advertising transcends sex, religion and race and targets (exploits?) some group the product is aimed at. It is not the advertisers fault that certain groups tend to buy more of certain products. It's called exploiting a market and that's their job.Bottom line - this is a confusing movie and I would strongly recommend giving it a "pass." unless you are a huge fan of one of the actors. 
tt0109675; You know, I want to like Lee. One of the great things about movies and literature is the ability to shock people. It's a childish impulse at heart, but great when you're deconstructing philosophies. In satirical cases, the childish impulse is justified by the purpose of the deconstruction. The need to expose the hypocrisy is much more than the jollies of the person doing the ripping.Unfortunately for Lee, satire requires a deft touch. Being too coy and the satire fails as a justification for the subject of the satire in the first place. Being too blunt and the satire comes off as preachy and self-serving. Lee and his work fall into the latter, he does not have the touch to do effective satire because he is too close to the subject matter. Lee has some valuable insight into matters of race (in that he never fails to remind us) and we take him at his word. Sadly, he is so bitterly one-sided that his preaching. Given his lust to bash all sides as a battle between him and THE WORLD, his movies often come off as diatribes that are disconnected from reality. The power of cinema is to put a person in a differing standpoint through prospective, and Lee doesn't grasp that. To him, it's a bigger stage for his ego and himself and we are 'fortunate' enough to pay only a meager fee to finance his house to hear this Great Oracle of the Nike Commercials speak his wisdom..which is about as intelligent as a thirteen-year old Goth girl talking about death and cutting herself.The racial politics behind Drop Squad are so pathetic--rich equals white and poor equals black--is that it makes a mockery out of Lee's MLK love. Lee never really grasps the idea of racism has a solid element of class-ism behind it. If you're black, you're poor yet humble. If you're white, you're rich and morally bankrupt. And if you're black and rich, then you're white and need to be knocked back down into being black. And with this, Lee's world of racism is complete according to this movie. And that idea is so self-hating and overly simplified that it defies logic. Are we watching an examination of race relations, or are we watching a poor little rich boy deal with his unresolved racial/class issues by endorsing the same idea of Crab Theory--see "The Corner" for more on this in a much more mature way then Lee could ever imagine or wants to--that tortured him as he was growing up? In fact, why doesn't Lee grow up and make movies a bit more textured instead of playing the game he was forced to as he was growing up? In short, Lee's "Do the Right Thing" was the alpha and omega of his career. He would never show the same maturity or grow above it ever again. In a sense, he sold out himself, and the world is lesser for it. 
tt1208723; Yvan Attal runs circles around Valeria Bruni Tedeschi in CA©dric Kahn's balls-out story of love passion and emotional confusion, 'Regret'/'Les regrets,' a movie about a youthful love affair renewed fifteen years later when both lovers are married to other people. The heartbeats are fast, and even if it feels more like anxiety than passion, Kahn and his stars take us on a wild ride. This is a lot of silliness, but it's also fun and beautifully photographed, and it does powerfully evoke the feelings of adolescent romantic obsession -- except that the adolescent here is a a grown man acting very immature and unwise. If there's an American remake, it can't be this good, because the French can do l'amour fou better than we can. Mathieu LiA©vin (Attal) is a middle-aged architect, married but without children, who runs into old flame Maya (Bruni Tedeschi) in the town square while back home with his mom dying in the hospital. The camera tracks in on both of them with that "gotcha' effect that means, these two folks are going to zoom in on each other pretty soon.What follows is all the chaos and excitement of a first-rate thriller, but without any dead bodies,though there are moments when you wonder if Matthieu and Maya are going to make it through alive. Much reckless endangerment occurs here, as well as chasing cars and trains and running from a man armed with a chainsaw. Maya turns out to have a drunken husband called Frank (Philippe Katerine) who's in the wine business and has a tendency to hatch elaborate schemes involving outside funding. Maya is maddeningly indecisive. Fifteen years ago Matthieu and Maya parted because they were driving each other crazy. They get right back into it in short order, except that life now is much more complicated.Matthieu's architect wife Lisa (Arly Jover) is pressuring him to enter competition for a major project. After his mother dies his ne'er-do-well brother wants to sell her house to pay off debts. Frank has his schemes, which Maya keeps committing to, she also has a daughter by a deceased African husband. The omnipresence of cell phones and the possibility of texting (energetically used, and romantic, here) seems to speed up the confusion and the wild pursuits. Maya is on and off about all this, ready to run off with Matthieu one minute, completely opposed the next.Kahn, who wrote as well as directed, has experience with serial-killer, crime-suspense, and sexual-obsession themes, and the mood here is one of thinly veiled criminal insanity on the part of Matthieu, with Maya as an unreliable but often equally mad collaborator. The film is skillful at weaving this pattern of wild behavior impulsively around the obstacles of the principals' everyday lives and commitments. This is adultery, of course, but it's a pumped-up, hyperventilating kind that we've rarely seen on screen, a kind that looks more akin than usual to flat-out criminal activity and is paced like a thriller. Attal is good as the hyperactive lover in his second adolescence, and Bruni Tedeschi is convincing and superb looking as the old flame he can never see without grabbing and kissing and, more often than not. quickly making love to on a table top or a stairway. Full disrobing never occurs. Shouting matches can occur anywhere. Matthieu is continually confrontational, and Maya is unable to confront.Some Phillip Glass pieces are particularly well used during a ominous car ride when the adulterous couple is rushing away together and their desperation seems suicidal. The good-looking images are thanks to cinematographer CA©line Bozon.None of this necessarily means anything, but Kahn is having fun with his blend of unlikely elements and he takes the viewer on an enjoyable ride. The near-absurdity of the behavior at times drew derision at Cannes. On the other hand, the feelings that are evoked seem perfectly valid as a description of the vagaries and torments of love -- in a brilliantly heightened and updated form.Shown at Cannes, 'Les regrets' debuted theatrically in France September 2, 2009 to fair-to-good reviews. Shown as part of the Rendez-Vous with French Cinema at Lincoln Center March 2010. 
tt1208723; I recently saw this at the 2010 Palm Springs International Film Festival. This a film about romantic obsession between two forty-something former lovers. Mathieu LiA©van (Yvan Attal) is a successful architect in the city and in business with his wife Lisa (Arly Jover) who returns to his rural hometown to visit his dying mother. He sees his former girlfriend Maya (Valeria Bruni Tedeshi) who has moved back there from Africa with her daughter from a previous marriage and new husband Franck (Phillip Katerine). Mathieu and Maya soon resume their long lost love with an illicit affair. These two really know how to push each others buttons for both good and bad. This film is a little far fetched at times but it keeps your interest because you never know which way the story might turn and it keeps you guessing as multiple situations arise. Written and directed by Cedric Kahn it features a powerful music score from multiple Oscar nominee and prolific film and television composer Phillip Glass. Also features the 1965 recording of Nina Simone "Sinnerman" that viewers will find familiar as it's opening bars are featured in the current television commercial campaign for HTC mobile phones. It kind of comes out of nowhere in the middle of the film and doesn't really add to the flow of the film. A fine cast and nice performances although the roles of the husband and daughter could have been more developed. I had a few problems with this film but would still recommend it and give it a 7.0 out of 10. 
tt1208723; Mathieu LiA©vin is an architect whose life seems stable and ideal. He is a quiet man, is in business with his girlfriend and seems very successful. As is ailing mother reaches the palliative stage of her illness, his life is about to change drastically. When he crosses a former lover on the street, the two of them begin a passionate and destructive affair.This relatively well acted film suffers from a slightly muddled plot and weak characters. At its heart, the biggest problem is that writer/director CA©dric Kahn seems unable to decide whether this is a film about Mathieu or a film about Mathieu and his lover Maya. This weakness is constant throughout the entire movie up to the very ending and I am surprised a French director would not even notice this fault back at the writing stage and commit one way or the other. Right off the bat, this is frustrating because any writer who does not know what he is writing about can't create a lasting and quality film experience.The second fault (related to the first) is that it is difficult to empathize with Maya, and the depressed and bland characterization by Valeria Bruni Tedeschi make it even very difficult to imagine Mathieu would feel so passionately about her. She is unattractive, lifeless, moody. One must suppose that the trial of losing his mother is what is affecting Mathieu so strongly but if it is so, it is rather vaguely implied.Where the movie shines is in certain scenes showcasing how desperate and wild people will get when passion overcomes an individual, affecting reason. It was particularly interesting to watch Mathieu seemingly act like a teenager, throwing himself over running cars and generally acting like an hormone-crazed younger man. But to the very disappointing end, Les Regrets never ever commits to themes that it wants to explore. The whole structure is very much that of French art cinema but the artistry on display here is all style, no substance. Giving it a 3 because Attal was rather convincing in certain scenes. 
tt1208723; Mathieu, a Parisian architect, is called to his dying mother's side. The painful realization she will soon die is made a bit less trying when he finds Maya, who has come back to the area after being in Africa for a while. Mathieu has lived to regret the loss of the love of his youth, and now, married, and having his own business, things begin to unravel for him.Maya also has regrets. Deep inside she never stopped loving Mathieu. Now that her former lover is back, she finds herself at a low point in her life. She also makes a tactical error in pursuing a situation that will leave her broken hearted because Mathieu is unable to commit to her, even though he tries.What Mathieu and Maya relive is their former passion. His wife Lisa senses she is losing him because he is haunted by the regret he feels in having left Maya when he did. After a mad Mathieu almost breaks down pursuing a resolute Maya decides not to continue seeing him, the lovers meet three years later only to realize there is nothing left of what they once had.Cedric Kahn wrote and directed the film. The film will resonate more with French audiences because the way the people understand what a passion can do to two people that have loved so deeply. It is hard to understand what these two lovers feel when they meet again after years of not having seen one another.The casting of Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi and Yvan Attal in the main roles works out because of they are intelligent performers. Basically, they are the whole film. Arly Jover, seen as Lisa, shows a promise of going far in the cinema. The musical score is by none other than Philip Glass. The cinematographer, Celine Bozon, captures intimacy between the Mr. Attal and Ms. Bruni-Tedeschi in vivid detail, bringing the viewer right into the picture. 
tt1208723; What struck me immediately when I spotted this DVD in a library was the unlikely teaming of the two leads, Yvan Attal personifies aggressiveness, virility, a sort of thinking man's ferret, hyper-active and largely insensitive whereas Bruni Tedeschi personifies fragility, porcelain beauty, vulnerability, I've more or less wanted to protect her in virtually every film I've seen her in because she exudes that rare quality that Judy Garland had. This is definitely Valeria's kind of film and by now she could phone it in, it's very much in the groove of Marion Vernoux's Rien a faire even though Kahn is light years short of Vernoux on the basis of these two movies. I would and will continue to watch Valeria in anything but I won't be in a hurry to watch this one again nor buy the DVD. 
tt0362174; SPIN takes a road much traveled - the coming of age tale of a child whose parents are suddenly absent - but the result is much stronger a story than most in this genre. Based on the novel by Donald Everett Axinn and adapted for the screen by writer/director James Redford (yes, son of Robert Redford, but strong enough a talent not to need to depend on shadows!), SPIN is an evocative moment in history (the 1950s) when the world was more quiet and young people would work their ways through the maze of adolescence without clouds of outside threats. This, then, becomes more poignant and sensitive a study of one lad's growing up to become an adult facing mirrors of those faces from the past and the present.Eddie Haley (Max Madore) is very young when his parents die in a plane crash and is placed in the care of his parent's workers Margaret and Ernesto Bejarano (Dana Delaney and RubA©n Blades) at the decision of his pilot uncle Major Haley (Stanley Tucci) - a man whose own demons have left him seemingly invulnerable to intimacy and family, electing to move away from the Haley ranch and its responsibilities rather than raising Eddie. Eddie's companion as a child is Francesca (Marissa Baca) who, while not an orphan, is motherless and living with a cruel father. They bond and in addition to the very supportive Bejaranos provide Eddie with as much footing as he is able to manage.Move forward to Eddie as a teenager (Ryan Merriman) and he has become a mild punk, floundering around seeking meaning to life and afraid of relationships - fearing he will be ultimately deserted. Francesca (Paula GarcA©s) moves back into town from Mexico and gradually the two become close and involved: Eddie's demons and issues riddle him while Francesca's equally brittle demons seem to make her stronger. Major Haley returns, is at first greatly resented by Eddie until the Major teaches Eddie to fly a plane left to him by his departed father. The relationship that develops between the two is as strong as it is difficult. A tragedy involving Francesca and her father occurs resulting finally in Eddie's ability to feel mature emotions and follows his courage and his heart to change his and Francesca's lives.Redford keeps this potentially saccharine story in tight reins, never allowing bathos but always sharing a view that each of us is human and capable of errors, but equally capable of recovering and resolving consequences. The cast is uniformly strong with Tucci giving one of his finest and most subtle performances to date. Merriman is young and shows great promise: Blades and Delany are seasoned veterans and bring a realistic rapport that adds to the credibility of a story also dealing with ethnic prejudice. The cinematography by Paul Ryan is excellent - some of the best aerial photography outside of the usual war scenes on film. Recommended, not because it is a great movie, but because it is an honest one and the first example of James Redford's seemingly generous talent. Grady Harp 
tt0362174; "Spin" came as a total surprise. We had not heard about the movie before, so when it was shown on cable recently, we decided to watch it, something that paid off because it is basically an unpretentious look at a not too distant past. James Redford, is making his debut as a director showing he has an eye for detail.The story centers around Eddie. When we meet him, he is a young boy who has to deal with the premature death of his parents in a small plane crash. As a result, his only living relative is a distant uncle, a major in the Air Force, who practically abandons him to the caretaker couple that works for him in the Arizona ranch. Eddie's uncle, as well as his father, have a passion for flying that is transferred to the young man. A few years go by and next we see a teen aged Eddie who is not doing well in school. His friendship with the lovely Francesca develops into love, but fate intervenes in their lives.The film has a lovely finished look thanks to the cinematography of Paul Ryan who captured the rugged Arizona landscape in all its glory. The musical score is by Todd Boekelheide, which serves the film well. The performances are credible as Ryan Merriman makes us care for his Eddie. Stanley Tucci, Dana Delany, Ruben Blades and Paula Garces are the other performers.James Redford does a good job with his first directorial assignment. 
tt0362174; This is one coming-of-age film I really liked and respected. Most of them are not "my cup of tea." However, this one features nothing but likable characters, including the teens. Yeah, they're not perfect, they have a few "moments," but mostly Ryan Merriman ("Eddie") and Paula Garces ("Francesca") are good kids.The adults are even better, just wonderful people. Dana Dalaney ("Margaret") and Reuben Blades ("Ernesto") play a couple who adopts young "Eddie" who loses his parents in a small- plane accident. Stanley Tucci ("Frank") has a key role as a mentor of the boy, a guy who leaves Eddie when he's young but comes back and teaches the now-17-year-old how to fly.Language-wise, there as almost zero profanity for the first hour, but there were cases of it in the last third of the movie. The photography is nice in here, too, especially for a film, I suspect, was low budgeted.This little-known film should be better-known. It's a nice story. I really can't imagine anyone watching this film and not enjoying and respecting it. 
tt0362174; This film left me feeling good, however, I admit that the story struck a chord with me in more than one area that other viewers may not experience. Being a pilot, I thoroughly enjoyed the aspect of the story that pertains to flying. Furthermore, Eddie is a character with whom I connected. The photography, particularly the sunsets and aerial shots, are beautifully captured. In all fairness, the story had a dry spot or two, but when I think of crappy films, this film is NOT one of them.The acting was well done, too. Stanley Tucci portrayed a retired Air Force Major and was quite believable as Eddie's strong, collected Uncle. Ryan Merriman, whom I've not seen elsewhere, also gave a sound performance.I give the movie an overall Bravo! 
tt0362174; As other commenters here have noted, Spin is a quiet gem with wonderful performances, breathtaking cinematography and a simple, familiar storyline that never descends into triteness.I think this flick falls into the 'life goes on' category - where Lasse Hallestrom leads the pack. It has true sensitivity without a single false note. I was ready to be disappointed by the scene in which Francesca reveals the nature of her tragedy, but the dialog was perfect - the only thing said was what was needed to be said, and the movie moved on to explore the same themes it had set up in the first 2 acts.In fact, the dialog and direction seem to be what gives Spin its depth - the cast is able to express deep and sometimes-brutal emotions through their interactions rather than through words and gestures. There was simply no artifice to this movie - not in the acting, not in the dialog, not in the images. I do have to disagree with the commenter who felt there were dry spells in the action - I fell into the movie almost from the first scene and felt carried slowly and comfortably along the entire time. They were (mostly) a nice bunch of people to spend a few hours with.I suggest Spin for anyone who would like to be wrapped in the feeling that although the world can be harsh, it doesn't necessarily have to be devastating. 
tt0362174; Air Force Major Frank Haley(Mr S.Tucci)is a typical John Ford hero.Detached and somewhat remote,taciturn,more used to giving orders than taking them and completely comfortable in his own skin.You'd better listen when he speaks because he isn't going to say anything twice. When his brother and sister - in - law are killed in a plane crash("Stormin' Stan Haley" - a very evocative name),the Major acknowledges his responsibilities and takes their 10 year old son into his care. However,he has his duty to perform and flies off to Guam leaving the kid at the family ranch looked after by the Mexican top hand and his Anglo wife((Mr R.Blades and Ms D. Delany). When he returns,the boy has become a somewhat difficult teenager although much - loved and very fond of his foster parents. It is time for the Major to step up to the plate and help the boy become a man. I watched "Spin" on Freeview the other afternoon perfectly prepared for it to be the usual soporific,superficial,glossy and instantly forgettable stuff that is the staple of a channel where the ads are for ambulance chasers and loan sharks, but I was surprised that in fact it was quite harsh and it took me somewhere I hadn't expected to go just when it was looking at it's most routine. Set in 1950's Arizona,it is to all intents and purposes a Western although their is not a horse in sight. Instead we have photogenic old aeroplanes slipping through the endless sky and stunning light,almost like a perpetual gloaming. There is Fordian darkness before the dawn,but the boy grows tall and true, a credit to his father,and is accepted by the Air Force Academy (I nearly wrote "West Point")much to the Major's delight. Mr Tucci is excellent as the Ethan Edwards/Tom Doniphon type. If Andrew McClaglen took the reins from John Ford,then Mr Redford has seamlessly carried on where he left off. "Spin" is a fine film and deserves to be better known. 
tt0362174; I was in a local video store that was closing down and selling off their stock, a trend these days it seems due to the emergence of Netflix and the like, and noticed this film. It caught my attention because I'm a pilot so I bought it ($2).It wasn't at all what I'd expected but I was pleasantly surprised none the less. The cinematography and acting are exceptional. The story is a little slow but holds your interest and you become invested in the characters as the movie moves along. They seemed real to me. That alone is saying a lot considering some of what is foisted upon the viewing public these days.While I would classify this as a family movie it does contain some dark material dealing with sexual abuse so I would not say it was for young children. Still and all, it was a pleasant viewing experience and I found it head and shoulders above a lot of what is produced in Hollywood these days.I would recommend Spin for anyone looking for a well done, mostly pleasant viewing experience. 
tt0362174; It really IS too bad that this film didn't get more publicity. I was an extra for this film (the funeral scene) and I must say how very professional and delightful the entire cast and crew were. I've been on many sets, and this one by far was the best! The days were LONG and COLD (filmed in Winter) but we got through it.I enjoyed watching the finished product and I'm sad that more people don't know about this film. Working with James "Jamie" Redford was awesome, and the day I was on set was Dana Delaney's birthday. We sang "Happy Birthday" and got cake...WOO HOO! Yeah, it's been a few years, but it's it never too late to see a touching coming-of-age movie. TELL YOUR FRIENDS! :-) 
tt0362174; In the 1950s near the Mexican border, Eddie Haley's parents die in a plane crash. Eddie's Uncle Frank takes care of him for a while, but his career with the Air Force requires a lot of travel and he can't take Eddie along. So Eddie is left in the care of Ernesto and Margaret, who run the Haley family ranch.Eddie meets Francesca at the park and they become friends. Francesca's father is mean, and she claims her mother and grandparents don't want anything to do with Francesca and her father.Several years later, Eddie is 17 and sitting in his father's airplane, which is his now. He has no plans to become a pilot, and he doesn't seem to have much of a plan for his life, period. Margaret gets a job teaching at the high school in town, so Eddie goes to school there and makes the football team.Eddie meets Francesca once again. She is very nice and quite pretty, but she has a dark secret. Not only that, but she is poor and Mexican, so she is treated differently by some people. Brad, whose father owns a mine where Eddie's parents died, is Eddie's friend. He knows about the plane crash but not the fact that Eddie's parents were in the plane. Eddie and Brad both want to date Francesca, but only one can, so the other gets Julie.Uncle Frank returns and teaches Eddie how to fly, though Eddie has never gotten over how he was rejected years ago.This starts out as a pleasant enough family film. Toward the end, though, some disturbing themes are introduced. There is nothing explicit except for one scene where there is blood, but no obvious clue as to where it came from unless one is really paying attention (what I mean is that a child wouldn't have to know it was blood). There are bruises, so we know one character was the victim of violence. And there is the suggestion of a despicable deed no child should know about.But the good news is that Eddie shows character and determination as a result of what happens. And an element of excitement is added as well. The film does inspire because of what Eddie has to do. I actually assumed this might have been a real person (otherwise, why did the film have to take such a dark turn?) until I saw the closing credits, which said this movie was fiction.Most of the actors give good performances, but Stanley Tucci stands out as a loving but firm uncle. 
tt0362174; Ryan Merriman was young Eddie Haley, whose parents die in a small plane crash as the movie begins. Stanley Tucci is Major Haley, a pilot and Eddie's uncle who travels most of the time. Dana Delany is Margaret, pretty Paula GarcA©s is Francesca who eventually becomes Eddie's girlfriend in high school. RubA©n Blades is Ernesto the ranch hand who effectively becomes Eddie's father after Major Haley leaves.Dad leaves Eddie a note, written in blood on a handkerchief as he is about to die after his crash, "Don't let this stop you." Eddie grows up bitter, is a class clown, gets into trouble here and there, wasting his potential. He even spurns the gift of love and friendship that Francesca offers. But when Major Haley returns, and offers to teach Eddie to fly, Eddie becomes an eager pilot, using a makeshift airstrip on their Arizona ranch.Eddie eventually comes around, the theme of the movie is "family", it is what you make of it with the people around you.SPOILERS, FOR MY RECOLLECTION, PLEASE READ NO FURTHER. Francesca's father has become a drunkard after her mother died, doesn't treat Francesca very well, even thought she is a model student and works after school at a local burger joint. One night while her friends are all at the school dance, her dad makes advances, beats her up and, we deduct from later comments, rapes Francesca. She leaves and he kills himself with a gun. Francesca gets out of town, gets drunk, gets sick with high fever, Eddie takes the plane to go to her, finds her, brings her back by plane for a hospital, magneto acts up, spare is bad too, crash lands safely, Major Haley comes to him in jeep, gets Francesca to safety, profess love for each other, as Eddie plans to head for Air Force Academy and Francesca for college in Mexico. 
tt2886926; I normally don't go out and watch Portuguese films, but this one caught my attention... And THANK GOD I'VE SEEN IT!! No, it's not a love story between and old woman and a kid, like the trailer suggests... It's a friendship story, and it's one of the most beautiful stories I've seen in my life! The music is good, suitable for the movie, and you kinda feel different stuff along the way... You can feel the pain and the struggle of an old lady dealing with loneliness and her husband's death, but still have lots and lots of love to give... Most of all, you can see her strength... And then you can watch the life of a kid, who's got no love from anyone, who gets beaten up the his father, forgot by his mother, and finds in the old lady some comfort and care... Overall, it's a beautiful movie, and really worth your time! Definitely GO and GIVE IT A TRY! 
tt2886926; Like other users said, don't usually watch Portuguese cinema (not there is a lot of it..) but had a lovely evening watching this one. Great cast with consistent good performance. If you let it it will take you in an emotional journey, make you laugh and cry. And if it makes you feel things isn't it a success? I would say so! Fair enough, might be a simple predictable story with the typical happy"ish" ending, but what's wrong with it? Restores you faith in mankind, you end the movie feeling good and reflect on the fact that love and care comes in all sorts of shapes and unpredictable situations. On a last note, and as expected, you can see the film didn't have the millionaire budget like Hollywood does but, even so, kudos to everyone that put it together for the brilliant job. 
tt2886926; This is a fun movie about several tragedies, placed in a dark Lisbon. Overall i think the main subject is friendship.The story is basically about an unexpected relationship between an old woman and a (still) teenager, which are connected by a mutual feeling of being abandoned and unloved.The movie tends to demonstrate in its universe that all blood family relationships are at some sort damaged or tragically nonexistent or unresolved, and i think there are two "cats" losing consecutive lives as the story progresses until both main characters achieves a mutual purpose, that is, they help one another to destroy the "spirits" of their lives that were working as a cage of protection but also as a repressive\self-destructing condition. (the movie title is in plural and while it supposedly refers only to the teenager i think the woman is another cat too).I also wonder if by the end both characters switch roles, the boy is the real older character (the only one that evolves into maturity) and the woman the only one that returns into a rejuvenated younger life, where she gets the chance to be a mother again and change a path of wrong into good, so the lesson here is and despite everything in between, "to love" is not necessary related to real blood relatives and comes out of indestructible friendship.The movie benefits a lot of having two of the best actors of their generation, the highly respected Nicolau Breyner (a small part, but Breyner is at a stage of his career that he can fill a screen with just an eye blink) and Maria do CA©u Guerra, the latter as the protagonist and the one that really pushes the movie into a succession of laughs and tears and her connection with the young actor is what makes the movie interesting. A great performance by an actress which isn't afraid of swearing like if she regresses into a rude-revolted teen against her own family as well as criticizing severely how the elder are being treated by an ever increasing narcissistic society, as if old people are just like any other trash being dumped into a recycle bin.The problem of the movie is that the story itself after a while becomes too predictable and too unreal, like, e.g., a friend of the teenager all of the sudden knows where the woman was taken and goes to that location without any problem (and the place, which we can eventually think for the high or upper middle class, it's obviously open to everyone...) and talks to her and everything is fine again, which gives some reason to most of the critics that are heavily criticizing the movie as just a soap-opera dialogue entertainment. I guess they are right about it here and there (another example, it was obvious there was a sex scene intended for the teen and a girlfriend, which didn't add anything to the movie, but the scene is cut out while the action is just starting, as if the director wasn't sure if it cheapen the movie too much, also there's another concession in the highly debated trailer which clearly implies a "dirty" story between an old woman and a young boy, a shame really).So the movie does have potential but the reality is that it drags too much in its concessions into a blockbuster movie with soap-opera's light entertainment, that is, like we often said around here, "um conto-da-carochinha" (a Portuguese popular fairy tale named after a famous one, that is often used in a phrase where something is told but the audience knows is pure fantasy) where ethics are mostly static and the end is always happy, typical of some recent Portuguese cinema, that probably thinks that to sell enough tickets they need to be empty. Even so, Guerra's performance was so solid that it lifts the movie into a much higher level. 
tt1259591; "L'autre Dumas", a well-acted, informative and entertaining film, got lambasted by most of the French critics. Why is that so? The answer is pretty simple: Safy Nebbou has "committed a double fault" by on the one hand making a period piece and on the other hand by dealing with a major figure of French literature, Alexandre Dumas, the immortal author of "The Three Musketeers", "The Count of Monte Cristo" and many other masterpieces. The wretched fellow who, like Safy Nebbou, dares recreate a past era will automatically - unless he is one of the chosen - be called "academic" by French critics. And when he is insolent enough to illustrate the life of historical figure, he makes matters even worse: he will never do the great man/woman justice. Apparently, only critics know what things really were like in the past and only critics know what Dumas or Napoleon or Joan of Ark actually thought.So, just disregard the bad reviews and go and see "L'autre Dumas": there are worse ways to spend two hours.The main interest of both the original play "SignA© Dumas" by Eric Roquette and Cyril Gely and its filmed adaptation is to put Dumas "the living legend" in his real place while bringing second fiddle Auguste Maquet to the fore. Maquet, who had been Dumas' co-writer for seven years, was never credited for his work and has often been called Dumas' ghostwriter, but the term is debatable because the two men worked TOGETHER, Maquet did not write IN DUMAS'PLACE. Always overshadowed by Dumas, Auguste Maquet deserved recognition, which he gets here. He is now the central character of this story: mistaken for Alexandre Dumas, Maquet falls in love with a lively female activist and ends up proving more revolutionary himself than ex revolutionary Dumas. And this role reversal is all the more effective as the authors do not fall into the trap of over-simplification. Maquet does not become an angel nor is Dumas demonized: both have their qualities and defects, which makes the story believable if fictitious. Moreover, they make it clear that if Maquet was instrumental in the writing of Dumas' masterpieces he was also unable to write alone. This ambiguity makes the relationships between the two men unconventional and interesting throughout.The pace is lively and the period well recreated (I did not live in 1848, granted, but I am insolent enough to believe that my own impression is well worth the professional critics'one), but what makes 'L'autre Dumas' a real achievement is of course the acting. GA©rard Depardieu was an obvious choice: just like Dumas he is a bon vivant, with an inclination for excessiveness and eccentricity. He is simply perfect for the role. BenoAt Poelvoorde as Maquet lives up to him but in an entirely different way. Cast against type, the ordinarily exuberant comedian refrains himself to become engrossed into the character of Maquet, someone reserved, frustrated and conventional but also industrious and rigorous. The actresses are good too: Dominique Blanc as Dumas' mistress, who subtly expresses romantic love lurking behind blasA© irony, MA©lanie Thierry as Maquet's vivacious love interest. Let's not forget the always dependable Catherine Mouchet as Maquet's no-nonsense wife and mother of six!A very good entertainment in which the viewer is not taken for a fool. 
tt1259591; Firstly, I saw this with English subtitles on the satellite French movie channel, Cinemoi.I'm no reader of literature, let alone French, but I enjoy my movies and this one is a good period romp, with a robust and typically fruity performance by Gerard Depardieu as the womanising and gluttonous Alexandre Dumas. His counterpart, the 'other',is the bookish, bespectacled and rather shy Benoit Poelvoorde, as Auguste Macquet.The film aims to redress literary history by stating that Dumas had a ghost writer, or 'help', in creating his masterpieces, such as The Three Musketeers. Apparently, this writer was indeed Macquet who was more a collaborator, the two bouncing ideas off each other. The story here, which apparently found no favours with the critics is rightly popularist, possibly stretched in its accuracy but always entertaining.The period detail is fine, as is the pace but it does also have its more serious side, charting stormy waters between the pair over women, writing contracts and events leading up to the French Revolution.There's some quite strong brief nudity and mild swearing and a little violence, which would suggest a cert 15. It's 105mins long and ably, if unremarkably directed by Safy Nebbou.With Depardieu at the helm, it is surprising that 'Dumas' isn't more well known and released over here in the U.K., as a 'normal' DVD. 
tt1259591; Sometimes a great man like Alexandre Dumas, one of the best French writers of all time, needed a sounding board, or a collaborator, if you wish, to bring his ideas to the written page. Such was his relation with Auguste Maquet, a man that was a historian, as well as well regarded man of letters in the literary circles of the times. In this chapter of both Dumas and Maquet's lives, we are presented with an interesting premise, which makes the basis of the wonderful film directed and conceived by Safy Nebbou the director of "Angel of Mine", which we enjoyed.We are taken on a boat trip to Trouville, a coastal town in the Calvados region near Deauville in Normandy. Dumas, a womanizer and bon vivant, is visiting the area. Accompanied by Maquet, he is prepared to enjoy the food, drink and women. Aguste, more interested in exploring the area, decides to pay a visit to Charlotte Desrives, a young woman whose father has been imprisoned for revolutionary activities. Maquet decides to pass himself as his friend Dumas to the excitement of the young woman who believes the great writer will be able to help her get her father out of jail. She gives Maquet a letter to be delivered to her father.Things get complicated as the travelers get back to Dumas' castle. Celete Scriwaneck, who was Dumas' lover, sees the excitement in Maquet. When he asks her to lend him her Paris apartment, she complies with his request, figuring he has a lover, not realizing what he is about to do. Maquet, supposedly happily married to Caroline. They have several children. Intent in getting Charlotte, he invites her to come to his place hoping for more than just a visit. As the young woman arrives, he realizes she loves a younger man who is a revolutionary."Dumas" is made more enjoyable by the high values Mr. Nebbou has given the production. Praise must go to the art direction of Cyril Gomez- Mathieu and the costumes designed by Karen Muller Serreau who reproduce in vivid details the sets of that era. The acting is first rate. Gerard Depardieu, bigger than life here, was born to play Dumas. The real surprise comes from Benoit Poelvoorde in the dramatic role of Maquet. We had only seen this actor in light fare, and he proves he is up to the task of carrying the picture, being he the central character. Beautiful Melanie Thierry appears as Charlotte. The excellent Dominique Blanc, with a long career in the cinema appears as Celeste. Among the supporting players Philippe Magnan, Catherine Mouchet, Michel Duchaussoy, Roger Dumas and the rest contribute to the enjoyment. Lovingly photographed by Stephane Fontaine with a musical score by Hughes Tabar-Nouval. It is after all Mr. Nebbou's vision on a chapter in the life of Alexander Dumas which he co-adapted with Giles Taurand and based on a play by Cyril Gely and Eric Rouquette. 
tt0098407; The plot: Writer, Dan Gillis, is hired to write a script for a money obsessed producer and a half-crazed director (and subsequently his sister) He soon realizes something is wrong, and that this film should not have been written. This leads to a confusing, and enigmatic journey trough the dark alleys of Paris. Greed, lust and insanity shows itself at very corner, and the movie becomes more about anything else than the movie itself. We never actually see the movie, and with good reason, instead we are left with an idea of a, half-pornographic, psychotic and depressing storyline. But, as many got wrong, it's not about the movies, the film is about people, their greed, lust and insanity, their madness and they way nothing is as it seems. Beware! It's one of those films where you can't trust anybody (except Jeff of course)I can't see how nobody likes this. Obviously if you are looking for Die Hard or a commercial action thriller you ARE going to be let down. This is nothing of the sort. It's an: intelligent, fascinating, psychotic, confusing, disturbing and utmost bizarre story. Then again isn't life all those things? The film is wonderfully executed, with fascinating shots and angels. If I would complain about anything it's the quality of film, and the fact that 90% of all scenes are faded out, which gives it an amateurish feel. But maybe that's what they wanted.This is a different movie, an almost neorealistic movie, it's a masterpiece of writing, and the acting is superb.I suggest you set of one evening to see this film. Preferably a dark a rainy night, cause this will scare the living daylight out of you.One thing a commenter commented was: it constantly leads to something and then stops. Some may not like this, I thought it was incredible. It's slightly Wagnerian! (Lot's of huffs and puffs, lots of build up, and never any release, never any release of the climax, it just lingers in the air until it fades away.)If you like realistic yet bizarre films, if you like a great story see this! 
tt0098407; An excellent movie, but not for everyone. Trueba's tinges of black humour cover a plot of sex, heroin and the not making of a movie. Liza Walker has an astounding performance as a young femme fatale. It's a pity her filmography is so short.This is a very dark film, with a strange suspense. You really never know where the film is heading. But this is one of its merits. And yes, in some countries (such as Mexico) unclaimed corpses are given away to medical schools and kept in huge translucid pools of formaldehyde, before they're given to students. Where do you think doctors-to-be get the bodies they train from, 1-800-deathpeople? 
tt0098407; Okay, I first saw this movie years ago mainly because it had Jeff Goldblum in it and I do love his acting style.Twisted Obsession is one of his more interesting films and certainly one of his more perverse ones.Based on the novel, The Dream Of The Mad Monkey, it tells the story of an American screen writer, Dan Gillis (Jeff Goldblum) who is hired to write a script. He becomes obsessed with the young directer Malcolm who is in an incestuous relationship with his beautiful sister Jenny. Thing begin to spiral out of control and soon he is trapped.Jeff Goldblum as usual gives a fine performance as the single father whose wife recently walked out leaving him to care for his young son.Miranda Richardson as Marilyn, his disabled agent is great as well. Both Dexter Fletcher as Malcolm Greene and Liza Walker as his sister Jenny Greene give good solid performances but to be honest, this is really Jeff Goldblum's film.This isn't a movie for all tastes, the buildup is slow and there is not a lot of action, but the story is atmospheric with a real underlying sense of creepiness that makes it interesting. While it is not as good as The Deadly Mr Frost, I think you will find it worthwhile. 
tt0098407;  This movie holds your interest for quite a while, with its eccentric and enigmatic characters, atmospheric direction and first-rate acting by Jeff Goldblum and Miranda Richardson (Lisa Walker is kind of weak though, as the nymphet). But eventually it becomes clear that the story leads nowhere. Its "title history" is a giveaway: you can find it listed under either "The Mad Monkey" (unattractive and meaningless - it's only the title of a fictional movie we learn nothing about) or "Twisted Obsession" (more "suggestive" and commercial)....but actually it doesn't matter what it's called, because it ultimately isn't ABOUT anything in particular.     (**) 
tt0098407; "Twisted Obsession" is without doubt one of the worst movies that I've seen in a long, long, time. It's obviously an attempt to emulate the kind of movies that Alfred Hitchcock made (the musical score, for one thing, sounds very Bernard Herrmannesque), but it fails in every way you can think of. Jeff Goldblum, for one thing, is extremely miscast, sticking out like a sore thumb and not blending in with the scenery or other actors. Possibly his bad performance is due to the fact that the screenplay is a sorry mess - for much of the movie, NOTHING of serious consequence happens! Things start to happen towards the end, but they are muddled and confusing, so much so that I didn't know what to think when the end credits suddenly started to roll. If you are looking for a pointless way to waste 103 minutes, here's your movie. 
tt0098407; Jeff Goldblum is a good actor. He has his typical way and sure enough this movie demonstrates his skills. However, the script is not well made. There is some interesting dialog, but there are many parts that should have been explained in more detail. The Paris scenery hadn't been used to an advantage, it could have taken place in any other city. The rest of the cast was simply poor, it explains why the other actors never hit it big. The worst part of the movie is the story itself, it's quite boring and one had wished a point or moral question would be addressed. The music was very wrong as well. It was out dated, even for 1980, and bad timing. The whole movie fails miserably in delivering a message or story telling. They posted this movie as a thriller, which puts the viewer in a wrong state of mind. It definitely was not worth my time. I voted 3/10. 
tt0277255;  This film could have been a triumph of art and satire. As it stands, it's definitely worth seeing (if you can get your hands on it).Filming was shut down by Scientologist protesters a week before shooting was scheduled to end and the film has been tied up in litigation in the US ever since. The pity of the situation is that the A-list crewmembers couldn't cross the protest line because it was made up of striking union members. This meant that the production values dropped considerably and in the shots that made it into the film from that period of shooting it is obvious that it is not the same crew.However, the movie is still a fun journey through one man's life of deceit. The acting is commendable but the standout aspect is definitely the cinematography. It's shot like a comic book, using colors to parallel the characters' journeys and accentuate the contrasts between the on-screen personalities. I could almost watch the movie with the sound off just enjoy the overall look. I strongly encourage anybody who enjoys visual style to see this film. It's also nice that this film isn't liked by scientologists and by seeing it one can thumb one's nose at their attempts to shut down free speech. :) 
tt0277255;  "The Profit" is the fascinating biography of a con artist who later founds his own cult, that later sets up itself as a religion. Sure, he has some problems from time to time (IRS, FBI, etc) but he is successful, i.e. he makes tons of money and brainwashes many people around the world. The concept used was the one used in "Citizen Kane", i.e. it starts with the cult leader dying and his life span of several decades is presented. 
tt0277255; This movie has a sort of 80s feel to it but it also delivers when given a chance.Any one who knows what this movie is about and all the back story behind it will enjoy it all that bit more. It is well made and very well written, if it could be remade I think it could be a hit... But that will never happen.I believe this movie will go down in cult status due to its big following and future following it will gain very soon. Once it is open to buy for everyone and the internet generation get their hands on it it will spread like wild fire.This is sadly why it has taken so long to get out. the "Cult" has tried very hard to keep this story behind closed doors... But nothing stays closed forever.Watch this movie and learn... You will not regret it. 
tt0277255; This fascinating legend of a man, Leeland Conrad Powers, mad with a want of freedom, who imprisons himself in a string of faulty lies, depleting his sense of stability and spiraling him, thoroughly, into madness and obsession is well worth watching. Intense, loosely edited, but nonetheless compelling, direct and honest tale of how Satanism mixed with psychotherapeutic hypotheses based in hypnosis can, theoretically, lead to a cult of Charles Manson Family proportions and eventually a religion like Judaism, or Scientology. No offense intended, just examples.Powers' followers are hypnotized into believing that all physical phenomenae are just processes of the mind, and not actually occurring. They avoid psychology and hypnosis ideas, and those in-the-know about them, because they are the basis of SciMIND, Powers' name for his process, and would easily discredit him as a quack, brainwashing people. The main tenet of Scientific Spiritualism, the religion, is that followers give it money... though they are a nonprofit organization.Ironically, Powers' madness leads him to believe his own ball of hooey, and he takes himself to be a true prophet of God, though he started it all to escape the fate of imprisonment.This is well worth watching. And, because the movie's distributor is not allowed to profit from sales in the United States, I think that you can make as many copies as you want in that country and give them away for free. 
tt0046087; I am a huge fan of Martin and Lewis and this is one of their best movies ever. The chemistry between them was phenomenal, and will always be remembered with nothing but the greatest respect from me. The other reason I liked it was the music in it, Dean had such a sexy voice and Jerry provided the comedy behind it. The color detail was superb, and the entire ensemble cast was really good. The horse in the movie did a really good job too, it amazes me the way they can train animals to do the things they do. I enjoyed the scenes Jerry had with all the animals he took care of, it was just fun. All in all, I recommend this movie to anyone who likes Martin and Lewis, it's a must see. 
tt0046087;  This one is a typical Martin/Lewis vehicle. They are cousins who have to manage a lot of troubles. Jerry gets his satirical performances, Dino gets his songs - they would manage their roles asleep and have a lot of self-ironic. But there are still more positive aspects: It is the teamÂ´s first picture in color, George Marshall directs with sure hand and the supporting cast is very good although there are no big names in it,  The first sequence in the movie where Dean is threaten by "Chambo Schneider" is a first class parody on gangster movie cliches of the Thirties, To sum it up it is a pleasure for fans like me. 7/10.
tt0046087; One of my two favorite Martin & Lewis films (the other being Artists and Models), this one was originally released in 3-D. I had the pleasure of seeing it that way a few years ago at the first 3-D fest held at the Egyptian Theater in Hollywood, but the added depth really didn't make that much difference in being able to enjoy it.Based on material by Damon Runyon (Guys & Dolls), much of it is typical Martin & Lewis fare, re-teaming them with heavy Robert Strauss and with Sheldon Leonard thrown into the mix for good measure. This may not be their absolute best, but it would be worth seeing if only for the scene that spoofs Cyrano de Bergerac to hilarious effect as Dean croons "I Only Have Eyes For You" before things go off the rails for Jerry. 
tt0046087; Money From Home was Martin&Lewis's first film in color and it is set during the Roaring Twenties and based on a Damon Runyon story from that era. With such character players as Sheldon Leonard, Robert Strauss, and Jack Kruschen playing Runyon's classic gambler creations of the era you know that at least that part of the film is more than satisfying.Dean Martin always casts well as that type and seeing Money From Home was a painful reminder of what a shame it was that Dino never got to play Sky Masterson in a planned TV special that never got off the ground in the middle Sixties. What a perfect part that would have been for him. His part in this film is a Sky Masterson type, a smooth talking lady's man who is dispatched to Maryland to fix a steeplechase race either by persuading owner Marjie Miller to scratch the horse or by having his dopey cousin, veterinarian trainee Jerry Lewis dope the horse.Money From Home never quite gets off the ground in terms of comedy. Jerry has been far funnier in other films both with Dean and one his own. The steeplechase race climax where Jerry substitutes for perpetually inebriated jockey Richard Haydn is lifted straight from the Marx Brothers classic A Day At The Races. As for Dean's singing he gets some truly forgettable numbers which he never recorded for Capitol records and he also sings I Only Have Eyes For You for which Paramount must have ponied some big bucks to Warner Brothers for the rights. Sad Dino never recorded that one because it fits him well.Not the team's best effort. 
tt0046087; Just watched this first color Martin & Lewis feature on YouTube. In this one, they're running afoul of some gangsters as they get involved with a certain horse those hoods don't want to win. The owner of that horse is a woman named Phyllis Leigh (Marjie Millar) who's in some financial trouble. Dean, of course, romances her. Jerry, who's sort of an animal lover, ends up falling for a female veterinarian named Dr. Autumn Claypool (Pat Crowley). Among the bad guys I alluded to are Jumbo Schneider (Sheldon Leonard) and one of his henchmen played by Richard Strauss in his third go-around in an M & L movie. Leonard, by the way, is another of the players from my favorite movie-It's a Wonderful Life-that has appeared with the boys during this period. He was also a recurring player from both the radio and television versions of "The Jack Benny Program" as was Frank Nelson who's the voice of an instructor on the radio who gives directions that causes Jerry into hilarious positions. Another familiar player to me that I enjoyed seeing was Richard Haydn, who I remember as Finchley in a "Twilight Zone" ep, as Edwin Carp on "The Dick Van Dyke Show", and as Max Detweiler in The Sound of Music, here playing the supposed jockey Bertie Searles. One more player I want to acknowledge is Bobby Barber, a court jester on Abbott & Costello sets who often made cameos in their pictures and TV shows, who also makes one here as a bald man in a restroom. In summary, this was the most hilarious of the M & L features I've seen yet and both Ms. Millar and Ms. Crowley made very appealing leading ladies for Dean and Jerry, respectively. If there were any creative flaws, I certainly didn't notice them so on that note, I highly recommend Money from Home. 
tt0046087;  Dean is in trouble. He owes money from gambling debts. (Why he doesn't pay off the debts by crooning those songs he's going to sing is a wonder). Jerry is an animal lover apprenticing with a vet. The mob as Dean to fix a horse they don't want to win. Dean is going to use Jerry to do this without telling him. Laughs ensue, there's two girls for the guy and a final race track scene that is up there with the great slapsticks of the Marx Bros, Chaplin etc 
tt0046087; Although this begins as a Runyonesque story, that disappears rather quickly as the film transforms itself in a somewhat typical Martin & Lewis film.There's some pleasant tomfoolery on a train with Dean as a sort of sultan and Jerry as a woman in a harem. And later a humorous ants in their pants dance. The race finale is well done."Moments Like This" is a nice song for Dean, but the version on Capitol Records had a better arrangement and vocal.Some of the scenes on the DVD were a little less than crisp, probably a result of this having been a 3D release back in 1953. Interestingly, Dick Stabile is not conducting the orchestra in the various scenes where an orchestra was involved.Pat Crowley is along as a vet and love interest for Jerry. Richard Haydn plays an alcoholic British jockey. Sheldon Leonard plays the head gangster.This is far from my favorite Martin & Lewis films, but it has its moments. 
tt0046087; This is an odd Martin & Lewis film because while it's pleasant enough viewing, it really didn't seem like a comedy. After all, isn't a comedy supposed to have some laughs? Well, this one didn't and sure could have used an infusion of humor. Now this is not to say it's a terrible film, but inserting a gimmicky 'funny' race at the end just was too little too late for the humor department.The film begins with Dean playing his usual sort of role--a heal. He is in debt to gamblers who are ready to beat him senseless (or worse) but decide to give him one more chance. If he agrees to fix an upcoming horse race, they'll not beat him half to death! So, having little choice, he decides to enlist the help of his spastic cousin (Jerry). However, Jerry really is just a nice animal lover and wants nothing to do with Dean's dirty tricks. Why Jerry eventually agrees to help him seemed a bit confusing, but help him he did. Along the way, both meet pretty ladies and fall in love. Eventually, Jerry poses (badly) as an English rider--but near the end of the film, the mob and Dean's new girlfriend learn of this and the two guys will be lucky to get out of this alive.The film is pleasant but not funny. Compared to most of their films, it's a bit flat...but at least it's in nice color! Not terrible...just one of their better films. 
tt0046087; Pretty lame Martin and Lewis feature. The pair get tied up with mobsters and horse racing. Could have been better. Lots of Jerry Lewis antics and scenes are manufactured so that Jerry can do his thing. Must have been funny back when, but now his comedy seems like he's retarded and not as funny. The character he plays would have been institutionalized if any one acted that way today. But I forgot, this is a comedy "fantasy" where anything goes. Looks like a lot was left out as scenes don't match and they jump around out of order. At one point they seem to kidnap the Richard Hayden character and drive away. Later they seem to be back at the SAME HOTEL. The harem music was playing at the Hotel of the abduction, then the harem music and girls are at the place where the gangsters kidnapped two characters. Just doesn't make sense as do other editorial flaws. The color is nice, and one nice song with two attractive leading ladies. Now available on DVD and if you're a REAL Martin and Lewis fan, I guess it would be a almost must see!!! 
tt1265994; In this terse indie effort by Peter Pontikis, Vera (Jenny Lampa) and Vanja (Ruth Vega Fernandez) are two sisters in a Swedish city who share a secret, they are vampires, although far from the kind we've become accustomed to in this age of "Twilight" and "True Blood." We do not find out much about them but are plunged straight into the story--on an evening when Vanja has promised to reveal a major life decision to Vera, a biker gang leader tries to molest Vera in a nightclub toilet and she kills him, sucking his blood. The sisters must run and try to stay one step ahead of the vengeful bikers, until a fateful confrontation.Everything about the story is brief and understated. These vampires do not appear to be undead, have no super-powers--not even fangs--and are as vulnerable as anyone else. The fact that they live on human blood seems to be the only real difference between them and ordinary mortals, but that simply emphasizes HOW different that one thing makes them.The locations are all real due to the low budget, rain, wind, etc., are all real and give this film a very immediate impact. The story leaves behind a simple, poignant feeling. Look out for an appearance by David Dencik, familiar from "Forbrydelsen," both "Girl With The Dragon Tattoo" movies, and "Those Who Kill." The acting from both principals is excellent, and I give it a 9 only because of a few scripting decisions I don't agree with artistically. Still, one of the best films I've seen in a few years. 
tt1265994; This is a good movie i gave it an 8. Since there is no plot at IMDb yet, here is the plot translated from Sweden to English, enjoy.One night two vampire sisters, Vera and Vanja, make a fatal mistake that forces them to run and fight for their lives while being chased by a biker-gang.On this particular night Vanja has also promised herself to share a life-changing secret with her sister Vera, Vanja is ready to try to give up the outcast vampire life, adjust to the real world and live amongst the humans. Vera, her sister, is frightened by a vampire-life in solitude and is willing to do almost anything to stop her sister from leaving her behind. At the same time the biker gang is closing in... 
tt1265994; Younger Sister Vera (Jenny Lampa) needs her sister Vanja (Ruth Vega Fernandez) to remain close. They are the ultimate outsiders, they are Vampire. They don't have any special powers and they don't even have fangs just a knife to make a cut and create a fountain to refresh. Vanja longs to live among the normals and has made plans to run off with a human man she has met. All this seems impossible now as Vera has taken the life of a motorcycle gang member and would be rapist. Now they are being chased through the dark streets as they each confront their own being. It is all nothingness, Vanja complains inside a movie theater before they must have a final standoff with the remainder of the motorcycle gang...only one will survive.The acting is OK, especially Jenny Lampa who takes control of every scene she is in. Ms. Fernandez is brooding and shy in her method she never seems to take control of the character. There is no professional qualities to the film making process and the look is more home movie than polished product. There should have been a more claustrophobic atmosphere to show the desperation of the sisters and the climate of their relationship. The ending is not there and there is no resolve to the film, none at all. I didn't hate it, I liked looking at Jenny Lampa's face and lips and the way she used her eyes. I give it 4 out of 10 because it is an early try and with a little effort they might have something there. 
tt0420136; Wearing a spotless white shirt and incessantly looking for clients to sell his body or drugs to, Victor strolls through the nights of Buenos Aires, vibrating city it appears to be. "Ronda Nocturna" follows this taxi boy's truly hallucinating trip on All Souls' night. Only a couple of (near imperceptible) slow motions slow down Victor's march.Backed by Cine Ojo, a production house specialised in documentaries, writer-director Edgardo Cozarinsky tidily portrays Victor and his natural habitat, outcasts of a society that itself is on the edge. Avoiding demagogy or political discourse, Cozarinsky shows the state his native country is in. But not without losing his sense of humour! A hilarious scene in a luxurious building depicts a diplomat, accompanied by a harem of rent boys, who is complaining to a peer about the allowance he is supposed to live on in Switzerland. And of course there is the unforgettable one-night stand with Margaret Thatcher!But Cozarinsky's major achievement is the subtlety with which he manages to slip a magic atmosphere in this raw-realist character study. Bizarre acts of love, dealing more with Thanatos than with Eros, make Victor doubt. Like vampires, lovers with scars hunger after their beloved. When the November 1st calendar paper is ripped off, the surreal night goes into its final lane. An encounter with an old sweetheart (an impressive Moro Anghileri) confronts Victor with his past Â<U+0096>his late youth in the country. He realises that his body is not meant for the things he does with it. At dawn, Victor is a changed man. 
tt0420136; Edgardo Cozarinsky is one of Argentina's most respected film makers and this elegiac nocturnal mood piece 'Ronda nocturna' is a stunning little foray into exploring the people who work by night in a big city, that big city could be anywhere in the world. This is not a film for those who need a storyline or those who aren't willing to go with the flow of the mind of the director in mixing the real with the imagined. But for this viewer this is a mesmerizing theme and variations that magnetically draws us into one evening on the calles de Buenos Aires.Victor (the fine twenty-three year old actor Gonzalo Heredia) is a hustler and works the streets from dusk until dawn, plying his various wares (drugs, his body, his camaraderie) on one particular November evening. He is 'protected' by a police Inspector (Gregory Dayton) in return for physical favors, shares turf with Carlitos (Diego Trerotola) who spends time in clubs with him and takes him to the 'better venues' of his trade including an ambassador's party where Viktor steals money, catches up on old times with a hustler turned taxi driver Mario (Rafael Ferro) with whom cruises the streets in the taxi talking with transvestites and hookers in a series of warm exchanges and whom he beds and has a threatened experience, narrowly escapes death at the push of a strange woman, befriends a street florist, revives an old girlfriend acquaintance....many things happen and nothing really happens. There is no story here except what happens to a pretty kid on the streets, no preaching, no climaxes, no major dramatic turns are developed and we leave Viktor as dawn rises over the city and his working time is over.The cinematography by Javier Miquelez is brilliant as is the subtle tango-influenced musical score by Carlos Franzetti. Gonzalo Heredia carries this film with sophisticated acting skills and despite the fact that we are never sure just how much of what we are seeing is real, imagined, drug induced, or remembered, we still care deeply for this quiet little charmer of a lad. His moments with the street florist are the stuff of film magic. Edgardo Cozarinsky knows his craft and seeing 'Night Watch' makes us want to explore all of his films. Highly recommended for lovers of art films. Grady Harp 
tt0420136; This film follows Victor, a young man who's making his living on the tough streets of Buenos Aires. The night in question is November 1, all souls eve.There's the policeman who takes his pay for protection out in trade. There's a private party among some diplomats in a posh hotel suite. And among these we see Victor as he wanders somewhat aimlessly through the occurrences that make up his life. There is some skin appeal in his scenes at a 30th floor health club and later in a 35 Peso a night motel room complete with jacuzzi but overall what we see is much grittier and decidedly less beautiful. We meet a few of his fellow hustlers and buddies as well as some past tricks and even the homeless street people that Victor associates with.While well made and generally easy on the eye this movie, like Victor seems aimless and while interesting for what it is, its not something that's easily loved. 
tt0420136; To all the reviewers who just about used up the frequency of the use of the word "BRILLIANT", and on this non film which IF the director had actually shot with a script or an idea in mind, I will stand corrected. What this improvisational piece of "NON BRILLIANTLY PHOTOGRAPHED" of hodge podge sequences that supposedly bring truth and knowledge to the viewer of a journey of a non developed in every way semi pretty boy who is just an ordinary street hooker who meets caricatures of johns who all speak and behave in the most boorish and colorless ways that it would have me have an "awakening" after the first "trick" was mid turned. Damn, but this is terrible filmmaking and the gushing few reviews write like they know something the rest of us do not know, or ever will be capable of seeing if we did not catch it now. This is a journey of just ordinary street trash who HAS to be more attractive than his peers, because they are just so NOTHING, but, any one of them was more interesting than the lead. There also is a dearth of humor or even a shot at mystery. The "older" reviewer who waxed so endearingly of days gone by in Paris actually makes this film more depressing than it is.A pigeon could have delivered a more meaningful message.The director was likely having a good time on the casting couch, or so it would appear. 
tt0420136; Maybe, if you are old enough and you were able to be in Paris in the fifties and sixties and lived the life after midnight in the Left Bank quartiers of St. Germain and St. Michel, you will appreciate this film of a night in Buenos Aires in Our Times. Circa this year, maybe last year, certainly next year.If you can remember the all night bar called La Pergola, where two films mentioned below were shot with hand-held cameras, you will love this new Argentine film.Probably the major difference you will notice: The streets are less crowded than they were in the fifties and sixties of the last century in Paris and London, too. And many twentysomething rent boys started their fairly short hauls toward all kinds of stardom in Paris and London back then, making the right connections in the film business, in the nightclub business, in the fashion business all with midnight trysts. Mostly in the street. That is where the talent was.No such luck seems in store for the kids in this Argentine night.If you were young enough to have seen "Breathless" when it came out, and "Les Tricheurs," a few short years before, or to have lived this era yourself, you will love this pitiless new film that spares no one. You will remember the all night La Pergola party at Metro Mabillon where most of both of the films were shot..... at night, during working hours, this was the new wave of street cinema.Print out the cast lists of those two films. It is a who's who of current French, even international cinema. I hope the fine cast of this Argentine film has such luck, but i doubt it. It is too old a subject.Just about the only difference between the mood of the Old Paris street and the recent nights in Buenos Aires in this film and in the Paris Left Bank before the invention of the Marais Gay Quarter in the eighties, which killed the Left Bank to a slow death, is the lack of hordes of young people out after midnight.Having lived that for several years, getting off my job at two a.m. and heading to the Left Bank, I can assure you that the mood, the lives, the people are the same except for the numbers. I guess Time Really Can Stand Still.There are not really any crowds in this film. There is more loneliness and alienation in it than there was in Paris back then, maybe a lot more heart ache, too. And of course, i am a lot older, like everyone.But if you love the night, wherever you are, do not miss this Brilliant film. 
tt0420136; Surely there's a better way to tell this story (there was a story?) that appears to be an attempt to quantify the meaningless of modern life, the regrets that haunt ones memories, and the endless search for something - anything - that may resemble a glimmer of hope. If Aregentina is truly this desperate, humorless and immature, forget about it. I'd rather see a musical version of "Waiting for Godot."Filled with vague, personal symbols that are probably quite meaningful to the filmmaker, we're constantly baffled by what we're seeing and waiting (for the most part) on something to happen, something that might make us care about the characters, the situation, the plight of "lost" souls. Yet, in the end, we realize that all we've actually been waiting for is the sun to rise and the final credits to roll.When asked what he thought was the hardest part about making movies, Mel Brooks said it was punching the sprocket holes along the edges of the film. This movie presents us with an alternative answer. The most difficult thing about making a movie is making one that matters. 
tt0137904; In Sunshine, Nevada, the middle-aged housewife Melanie Leroy (Talia Shire) sees her husband Ralston Leroy (Nathan Le Grand) shagging her neighbor and she freaks out. Then she poisons Ralston, who is allergic to seafood, in the dinner.Melanie travels to the California to the apartment building that she has inherited from her aunt and when she meets her tenant Patrick Forman (Jack Coleman), she believes that he would be a perfect husband for her. She uses her maiden name, Melanie Leroy, and becomes obsessed for him, killing anyone that might interpose between Patrick and her. "The Landlady" is a lame low-budget thriller, with a plot with many holes and an awful lead actress. The story is a dreadful rip-off of "Fatal Attraction" and "Misery" with a predictable conclusion. I bought this DVD some years ago and today I unfortunately decided to see it. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): Not Available 
tt0137904; If you have a thing for so-bad-they're-good horror/suspense/thrillers from the '80s and '90s, do I have the one for you... especially if you find movies about psychopaths and stalkers to be particularly entertaining. Landlady Melanie Leroy makes for a memorable psychopath. Her relentless stalking calls to mind the terrifying antics of Alex Forrest from "Fatal Attraction." Alex Forrest was a maniac to be sure, but Melanie Leroy has a more subtle evil about her. The kind of moral insanity that leads her to pop off one tenant after the other, while also finding the time to install a spy camera in a smoke detector and install a full length two-way mirror in the wall of her apartment so she can thrill herself watching a male tenant flex his muscles in the mirror. Admittedly, some of the tenants in the building were so annoying that you can't help but laugh at the various ways in which Melanie Leroy systematically murders them. From the thoroughly unlikeable scam artist of a building manager who doesn't collect rent because she's too busy chain smoking and mating with the maintenance man, to the nasty, demanding call girl down the hall who arrogantly demands new furniture for her apartment, for no apparent reason, because her trashy cheetah-print furniture seems to suit her just fine.The premise of the film seems to revolve around the unbalanced middle-aged landlady obsessing over one of her tenants, a busy young bachelor named Patrick. She maintains a frumpy, dowdy appearance, casting a disdainful eye on anything she deems to be unwholesome. Yet when Patrick enters the scene, she seems to lose control of herself, engaging in awkward flirtations and eyelash batting. Anything for you, Patrick. She spies on him arguing with his drug addicted girlfriend in the hallway and seethes with jealousy. She's not good enough for you, my Patrick. She follows the unsuspecting goof around, entering his apartment to steal one of his shirts so she can sit alone in her apartment and sniff it. Yes, the landlady has some problems. Good thing she has her murdered husband's ashes in an urn that she can talk to when she feels overwhelmed by the complexity of her feelings for Patrick. (The movie opens with our troubled harridan spying on her hubby romping with a younger woman in the buff. She kills him. From there she inherits the apartment building and her tenants' fate are sealed)There is a good build up of suspense throughout the film. You know that the day will come when Melanie finally has a break down and confesses her undying love for Patrick, someone blabs to him about it faster than she can kill them, or he stumbles upon the ugly truth himself. It's only a matter of time. And there are plenty of good laughs along the way found in the one-liners that Melanie comes up with as she eliminates anyone and anything standing in her way. "I'm a good girl!" This film also brings to mind the film "Crawlspace," another example of psychopathology playing out in an apartment building, with Karl Gunther, the diabolical landlord who is so deranged that you can't imagine another landlord ever coming close to being so completely and uncontrollably insane. Melanie Leroy might be a good match for Gunther, but isn't quite as memorable. 
tt0137904; I brought this movie for $2.00 because I was bored and I wanted a cheesy low budget horror movie and yes I did love this movie a lot. It is very cheesy yet good. Very low budget but the money the did have they obviously used it wisely. The horror in this movie well there isn't really that much horror its more thrilling and suspenseful than scary. Talia Shire's acting was very good. The other actors were very poor at acting. I really liked this movie because it was original and it was something new unlike all the remakes that there making.Acting 7/10...Death Scenes 4/10...Setting 2/10 So overall 13/30- Not a high score because there wasn't that many death scenes and the setting was always just at that one apartment building. 
tt0137904;  The script is pretty weak and has already been seen before, but Talia Shire is good.Talia Shire is a housewife who inherits an apartment building. She becomes fixated on one of her tenants. But he already has a girlfriend. She will go to desperate measures to get him, including murder.The acting is OK,however Talia Shire is even funny at times as a PSYCHO LANDLADY! 
tt0137904;  There are some unintentional laughs in THE LANDLADY as the plot gets more and more absurd--but it does hold the attention as you keep wondering how this lady's killing spree will end. Talia Shire does a credible job of making the title nutcase a frighteningly obsessed creature as she goes about plotting her next kill.She plays a landlady obsessed with a hunky man she accidentally bumps into--on the first day of taking over as manager of a seedy looking apartment building. It's love at first sight (on her part) and she quickly decides that he will fill the void left by her husband whom she has efficiently murdered after finding out he cheated on her.Thus the plot is set into motion as her obsession for her neighbor reaches titanic proportions. Saddest and funniest sequence has her eating popcorn while she stares at her neighbor through a two-way mirror while he disrobes. As the hunky neighbor, Jack Coleman does an excellent job--although it's hard to understand why he didn't fend off her designs on him a bit earlier. After all, her signals were not exactly subtle.A watchable little film that has some gripping moments as Talia gets more and more over the top in her quest for fulfillment. None of it seems real and some of the lines and situations are laughable--but just try to look away!!Summing up: a minor thriller with tongue in cheek approach to a serial killer's shenanigans. 
tt0137904;  Until it succumbs to slasher cliches in the final reel, The Landlord is a refreshingly different take on the genre. Well written and well acted, The Landlady stars Rocky Balboa's old love interest, Talia Shire, as a sexually repressed (fundamentalist?) Christian who inherits an apartment building in Los Angeles. She proceeds to get the hots for one of her tenants...and nothing will stop her from settling down and starting a family with him. You'll be pleasantly surprised by it all.  
tt0137904;  At times it seems Talia Shire was playing this for laughs.  Her performance definitely hit some very campy notes.  Fairly predictable the whole way but becomes ludicrous as the body count piles up.  And it's always good to see Courtney Gaines(Rags from "Hardbodies") still working.  Tiny role but you can't miss him. 
tt0137904;  In this depressing slasher movie `from the producer of WISHMASTER and THE DENTIST' (how could that ad copy fail to bring in viewers?) , two-time Academy Award Â® nominee Talia Shire plays Melanie Leroy, a bitter, unlikable harridan who sniffs other people's laundry and decides to go on a half-ass killing spree after inheriting her dead Aunt's apartment building. Shire spends the whole movie ranting to her dead husband's ashes and obsessing over her nice-enough social worker tenant (Jack Coleman from the NIGHTMARE CAFA<U+0089> T.V. show), spying on him with 2 way mirrors and video cameras, and eventually tying him to the bed in scenes that are like a fourth grade class production of  MISERY.  While this unbearable flick rolls on Melanie offs people with a refrigerator door, an enormous candle stick, a butcher knife, a steamer trunk, a gun, sleeping pills, a dry cleaning bag, and, scariest of all, shellfish. Yes, apparently feeding someone shellfish when they're allergic is sca-a-ary! Move over, Jason Vorhees!Where was I? This movie. I tried to think of some ways to make it better, but all I came up with was to give two-time Academy Award Â® nominee Talia Shire a Muppet Â© sidekick that only she can see and who can grant wishes. Sorry.
tt0137904; I wonder what goes through the minds of famous Hollywood actors to do low budget non-scary horror movies. Talia Shire probably made fortunes starring in The Godfather and Rocky and the subsequent sequels, so what made her star in this slow, boring snoozefest of a horror film.The storyline is Christian housewife spots her fat bald husband getting in on with someone else so she kills him.....by feeding him food he's allergic to. She then becomes the landlady of run down apartment complex in which she kills everyone who comes between her and a tenant she obsesses over.This movie is soooo boring that it takes 15 minutes between kills, and they're not even bloody. Talia forces someone to OD, she hits someone in the head repeatedly with a freezer door and she pushes a poor sap down the stairs. Other kills are incorporated but they're pretty much bland. The highlight of the movie is a flying bodypress by Jack Coleman's character (or was it his stunt double) on Talia Shire...Ricky Steamboat he isn't.Talia Shire did do a great job at playing the lunatic Christian landlady but she looked really out of place. I guess she wanted to broaden her abilities as an actress but not even her work saved this movie from putting my friends to sleep.2 out of 10 
tt0035713;  Scientist and surgeon John Carradine, having worked miracles in the area of glandular research, now wants to change a stolen gorilla into a woman - why?  We really never understand his motivation, but what we do get in Captive Wild Woman is a pretty entertaining ride that one can learn to expect from Universal Studios.  Ferocious lions and tigers, a fairly good imitation of a gorilla, John Carradine hamming it up, Milburn Stone reminding me of Gunsmoke every minute he is on film, Evelyn Ankers wearing outfits that only Auntie Mame would wear, and the beautiful, silent Acquanetta all make this a very unique and welcomed addition to the Universal pantheon of horror goodies.  Though not a great film, this one packs a punch for a 61 minute film.  Never a dull lull in the action.  Carradine plays a very suave, polished doctor that is utterly crazy, mad, and heartless.  It is a pretty good performance from Mr. Carradine.  The rest of the cast is very able.  Ankers and the silent girl transformed from ape - Acquanetta - are appealing eye candy as well.  A couple quick notations.  Ms. Ankers is a secretary, yet has a wardrobe of a wealthy socialite.  She apparently lives in a boarding house, as in one scene she is in a bed witnessing the ape woman coming into her room by the window - a landlady type comes to the door way across the other side of the room.  The landlady yells and runs and the ape woman, rather than killing her intended victim inches away from her - runs way across the other side of the room and down the hallway to kill a woman for no reason.  Hmmm.  Despite these little observations, a highly recommended film.  Hope this one comes out on DVD soon. 
tt0035713;  This is a terrific fun movie to watch, to see how great Universal Studio was back in the early 40s, when they could whip up this glittering little gem on a very low budget. For one thing, its technical crew and cast were all the very best. Evelyn Ankers shows her classic horror heroine side and her screams are among the best. Cult B-Actress, Fay Helm, plays one of her nurse roles and is fantastic, especially when she defies the mad scientist, John Carradine--also in top form--about the dangers of transfusing human blood into a gorilla. Sultry starlet, Acquanette, says not a word but is wonderful eye candy in her short, sexy skirts. Her transformation into a human gorilla is stunning. Lots of stock footage of animal tamer, Clyde Beatty, although it's supposed to be Milburn STone (later of "Gunsmoke" fame) in the lion cages. Wonderful photography and lighting. Vera West does outstanding job outfitting Ankers, especially in her fur hat and coat in the finale. Ankers supposedly hated making movies, especially the ones that Universal type-cast her in. Her talents were criminally wasted since she proved her talent in Sherlock Holmes "Pearl of Death" where she plays 3-4 roles and especailly "Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror" where she plays the heroic Kitty, the prostitute. Watch her go to town in "Weird Woman" where she plays one of her rare villains. Helm never had big roles but she always made the few minuts on screen really count. She was also "Jenny" in the "Wolf Man" and her greatest role as Margaret Ingston in the horror classic, "Night Monster" where she and another acting great, Doris LLoyd, steal the movie right out from under the hideous "Night Monster." 
tt0035713;  Mad scientist Dr. Walters steals a tame gorilla named Cheela from animal trainer Fred Mason for use in his experiments. Through the use of sex hormones (!) and a brain transplant, Dr Walters turns Cheela into a beautiful woman whom he names Paula Dupree. When Walters brings Paula to the circus where Fred works, it is discovered that Paula has a hypnotic power over animals, and Fred uses her in his animal act. Paula becomes attracted to Fred, but she goes ape (literally) when she discovers Fred is engaged to Beth Coleman. CAPTIVE WILD WOMAN has an unjustified bad reputation among fans of the classic Universal horror films. Because the film spawned two poor sequels, this pretty good programmer shocker is often unfairly maligned. The film has good performances from Evelyn Ankers, Milburn Stone and especially John Carradine. John Carradine plays the mad scientist Dr. Walters with a cool icy demeanor. Its a surprisingly low key performance from Carradine. Acquanetta is perfect as the beautiful woman whom Dr. Walters creates from an ape. She projects a perfect exotic animal sensuality. Of course her role here is helped by the fact she does not utter a single line of dialog. Acquanetta was a fine looking woman, but she was never much of an actress. Edward Dmytrk handles the director chores well, the film is well paced and moves along at brisk 61 mins. One shudders to think what would the film would have been like if the studio brass handed the directorial chores to one of studio's standard hacks.One problem with the film is inserting animal training sequences with Clyde Beatty from an old Universal film, THE BIG CAGE. While Stone resembles Beatty, some of these scenes are poorly inserted. In one scene we see Beatty in the cage with the lions and tigers. Then we see Stone enter the cage! The editor should of most certainly have caught this. To make matters worse, the same error turns up again when the studio used the same footage in the films sequel, JUNGLE WOMAN.While CAPTIVE WILD WOMAN certainly doesn't rank among the classic the Universal horror films, its not a bad little saturday double bill shocker. However, the premise was only good for one film. The films two sequels were not warranted. I can't believe Universal actually thought Paula the Ape Woman was a potential classic monster like Dracula, The Wolfman, The Mummy and the Frankenstein Monster. They should have quit while they were ahead. 
tt0035713; Silly, forgotten Universal horror film, now found on DVD in a Best Buy exclusive set. This one concerns a mad scientist with Nazi undertones (John Carradine) who kidnaps a circus gorilla and turns her into a human being (played by Acquanetta). As a human, Acquanetta has an uncanny ability to control lions and tigers, and is thus employed at a local circus (the one whence she, as the gorilla, was kidnapped) to help big cat tamer Milburn Stone. If Milburn Stone looks familiar, it's because he became famous as "Doc" Adams on Gunsmoke. The movie is silly but fun, with Carradine hamming it up like he usually does. And, while Acquanetta does little acting, she has a hypnotic look with those giant eyes. Unfortunately, the film, like many of the Universal Horror movies, ends abruptly, with a weird narration about the Carradine character. The animal work is pretty stunning for the time, and the editing is mostly convincing that Stone and the big cats are in the cage simultaneously. I would credit director Dmytryk, who was far too competent to be directing this kind of crap (the next year he would do the wonderful Murder My Sweet). If you love animals, you might be sickened at what is done to them. Lions and tigers are thrown into a cage and forced to fight each other. The one big fight ends with a fire hose, and the tiger, at least, looked like it was badly injured. The film is completely forgotten nowadays, but it did spawn two sequels. 
tt0035713;  Typical 1940's Universal monster film. It is enjoyable and is a nice way to spend an hour. The cinematography, when they show the sanitarium, is spooky looking.  Now that I think of it, it looks like the same mansion that was used in "Munster, Go Home". Could have been, as both of these films were filmed at Universal!! I liked this film, but then I like all of those Universal monster films. 
tt0035713; The film is not really 10/10. I just want to get the vote average up.Anyway it's simply a "Mad Scientist puts human brain in an ape" movie and you can't expect too much, but this film is one of the best of it's infamous kind. Carradine is quite a dedicated scientist who will, as usual do just about anything to accomplish his goals. Acquenetta, top billed, has virtually no dialogue whatsoever, she usually just looks over at the camera in a possibly intoxicated haze. The film will not change your life but if you've seen most of the Universal horror classics and want to explore some of the lesser ones, this is a great one to start off with. 
tt0035713; Dr. Walters {John Carradine} has made great strides in his field of glandular transplants. But as his work progresses, the more unhinged his approach to his science becomes. Stealing a tame gorilla from the local circus, Walters transforms the gorilla into a beautiful woman whom he names Paula Dupree {Acquanetta}. Upon taking Paula to the circus it's found that she has hypnotic powers over the lions and tigers and is promptly made part of the taming of the beasts act. But can Paula contain her true animal instincts?Sounds bonkers doesn't it? Well it is, but it's not the plot that makes the film so distinctly average. This is after all a low level Universal Pictures movie, we want, in fact demand, bizarre plots and berserker horror episodes. The problems exist with the complete lack of tension in the script, for a film that has a running time of just over an hour, you would think the big "transplant" and creation of "wild woman" would come sooner rather than later. But it doesn't, what we get is 45 minutes of musing about science and continual takes of circus animal training. With the latter containing some truly awful editing. Paula puts in an appearance late in the piece, then bang! it's pretty much the end and one can't help be disappointed after having stayed with it thus far. Carradine hams it up and enjoys himself one feels, while Evelyn Ankers gives the other performance of note as Beth Colman. The film also serves as an interesting point of reference in the career of director Edward Dmytryk, who in the following few years would deliver some classics in a number of genres. He deserved better material here, hell they all did. But as ever with most of Universal's horror pictures, you end up taking the rough with the smooth and still enjoy yourself. A watchable yet frustrating experience it be. 5/10 
tt0035713; John Carradine's first lead in a horror picture. He's a doctor and authority on glandular diseases who becomes interested in an extra-intelligent gorilla named Cheela. His plan is to use the blood of one of his human female patients to transfuse into the ape and turn her into a beautiful young woman (played by Acquanetta). The typical problem is that the ape tendencies keep on creeping back. This performer Acquanetta made several other films after this one, but she was always a terrible actress whenever she opened her mouth to speak a line. However, she pulls off the role as a human with primitive origins fairly well enough here by keeping mute and using her eyes and limited facial expressions. Sometimes things get a bit bogged down by an over-reliance on animal stock footage from THE BIG CAGE, but the presence of Carradine's mad doctor and a different breed of "girl monster" keep this a serviceable entry in Universal's horror series. **1/2 out of **** 
tt0035713; To be honest, I had little faith in this one Â<U+0096> and, if the "Leonard Maltin Film Guide" is to be trusted, that feeling is certainly true of its two sequels, however, I was pleasantly surprised by it Â<U+0096> even if, at the end of the day, the film rests squarely on the (most capable) shoulders of John Carradine and, admittedly, the animal training scenes (actually stock footage from a much earlier title!) probably take up more than half of its running-time (which is barely over an hour to begin with!). Anyway, the plot is basically "The Island Of Dr. Moreau" using more up-to-date technology (glandular transplant) and given an American small-town setting, however, the latter stages Â<U+0096> denoting the hybrid creature's murderous jealous fits Â<U+0096> are a definite nod to the Val Lewton classic CAT PEOPLE (1942). Having preceded this with a viewing of the superior (and more sci-fi oriented) MAN MADE MONSTER (1941), it was interesting to witness the similarities in the "Mad Doctor" characterization Â<U+0096> down to the dialogue, where not only is he willing to commit murder (sacrificing one measly life for the good of Science) but in the way the mind of a brilliant scientist has warped in the pursuit of his own 'immortality', a Shakespearean actor, Carradine cannot have been pleased to be appearing in this type of fare (and he made scores of them throughout his lengthy career!) but there is no denying the intensity and, thus, conviction of his performance here (amusingly, he plays a Dr. Sigmund[!] Walters) Â<U+0096> particularly the calmness with which he tosses circus wrangler Paul Fix into the path of a gorilla which hates his guts or working out in his mind how to use, rather than merely dispose of, people who threaten to disrupt the all-important experiments (such as wavering assistant Fay Helm and, eventually, heroine Evelyn Ankers). The latter (with whom I happen to share my birthday!) graced many a Universal horror movie Â<U+0096> as did, incidentally, some of the borrowed music cues! Â<U+0096> but here she has to contend with the oddly-named Acquanetta, who looks exotic enough (and certainly fetching in 'jungle' garb) albeit saddled with a speechless role (thus having to act virtually with her eyebrows alone!) and, later, unbecoming ape make-up!!, also appearing briefly as Ankers' younger sister (and Carradine's guinea-pig) is Martha Vickers Â<U+0096> billed under her real surname, MacVicar, and who would later be memorably sexy in Howard Hawks' THE BIG SLEEP (1946). Lloyd Corrigan, then, is the flustered circus owner, Vince Barnett the diminutive comic-relief of an absent-minded feeder and, of course, there's rugged Milburn Stone as the would-be animal trainer leading-man: apparently more often seen as a character actor or in bit parts, he makes for one of the dullest heroes in the annals of Universal Horror! Although this film eventually found its way on that exclusive (or is that elusive?) "Universal Classic Horror Archive" 3-Disc Set, I had to regretfully settle for an artifact-riddled DivX copy... 
tt0035713; Brilliant, but ruthless and unscrupulous scientist Dr. Sigmund Walters (nicely underplayed by John Carradine) turns a huge wild ape into a beautiful, yet still deadly mute woman named Paula Dupree (an impressively expressive pantomime performance by the ravishing Acquanetta). Paula gets a job keeping animals tame in a circus. Complications ensue when Paula falls for rugged and dashing animal trainer Fred Mason (a likable portrayal by Milburn Stone) and reverts back to a hirsute bestial state. Director Edward Dmytryk, working from a compact script by Griffin Jay and Henry Sucher, relates the engrossing plot at a steady pace, maintains a serious mood throughout, and stages the thrilling climax involving a fierce thunderstorm and a hulking rampaging gorilla (veteran simian thespian Ray Corrigan in a nifty suit) with considerable rip-snorting aplomb. This movie further benefits from sound acting by a sturdy cast: Carradine keeps his trademark eye-rolling hammy tendencies on a leash for once, Acquanetta's dark exotic beauty adds credibility to her admittedly far-fetched role, plus there are praiseworthy contributions by the fetching Evelyn Ankers as Mason's concerned girlfriend Beth Colman, Lloyd Corrigan as jolly circus owner John Whipple, and Fay Helm as the reluctant Nurse Strand. The scenes involving savage lions and tigers performing various daring feats in a cage are genuinely gripping and exciting. George Robinson's crisp black and white cinematography makes neat use of fades and dissolves. The spirited film library score likewise does the rousing trick. The terse 61 minute running time ensures that this picture never gets dull or overstays its welcome. A huge enjoyable fright feature potboiler. 
tt0016481;  This is another of Jannings' towering and sensitive portrayals that earned him the accolade of being silent film's best actor. He is wonderfully energetic and playfully in love in the first half, tortured, shocked and rage-filled in the second.  Norma Desmond's "They had faces then" was never so apt as describing his wonderful performance here.  The story is a simple one of seduction, betrayal and murder.  What is so brilliant is the extraordinary cinematography of Karl Freund and the equally extraordinary editing, both of which would most probably have copped Oscars if the Academy had existed in 1925.Freund's moving camera, especially in subjective trapeze swings, compositions and amazing use of extreme close-ups are revelatory.  Herein he advanced the art of cinematography by leaps and bounds.This is one to see and to relish over and over again.  Great Jannings performance, great cinematography and editing.  Don't miss it. 
tt0016481; The male flyer initially appears in cinema as a flawed hero. The prototypes are characters found in Variety (1925), directed by Ewald Dupont and based on Felix Hollaender's novel, The Oath of Stephen Huller.This is a semi-expressionist film about a heavy-bodied catcher-husband, Boss Huller (Emil Jannings), whose wife, Bertha-Marie (Lya de Putti), is seduced from domestic bliss by the trio's lighter-bodied star flyer, Artinelli (Warwick Ward). The cather-husband imagines dropping his rival, the flyer, but murders him instead in a fight, and goes to prison. The seducing male flyer is the provocateur of extreme passion, a position subsumed by female aerialist characters in later films. But the male aerialist as a criminal, even murderer, intermittently reappears in representation because he epitomizes a capacity for extreme risk-taking, which is translated into socially risky immoral behavior. But it is the male flyer who becomes especially vulnerable to depiction as a fallen hero, literally and for losing emotional control.Although little-known today, Variety is one of the major works of German Expressionism. It's an immorality of emotion drama with a fine performance by (the always great) Jannings and the wonderful visual film-making that is the hallmark of the Expressionist movement (extraordinary cinematography by Karl Freund). Variety was heavily censored for its American release, how it was changed makes it almost as interesting as a case study in film censorship as it is enjoyable as a movie.In its original version, the film begins with a drawn-out portion showing how Emil Jannings falls in love with Lya De Putti, left his wife for her, and created a trapeze act with his lover. This part of the story was excised completely by the American censors, and title cards added to redefine Jannings and De Putti as the married couple of the U.S. release version. The censors' intent was to erase the plot point of casting adulterous lovers as the established couple in a love triangle. The effect was to far more radically transform the story. The unfaithful husband who is in his turn betrayed by his unfaithful lover is transformed into a sympathetic cuckold. The opportunistic temptress who catches two men only to end up with none is transformed into a young wife who succumbs to temptation. From unsparing morality play to conventional melodrama, courtesy of censorship. 
tt0016481;  The print I saw recently did not contain the "prologue" mentioned above, which I assume was lifted from the novel on which the film was based. If it had been included in some form, it would have made several things clearer: 1) where "Boss" got his nickname, 2) why he was so much older than Berta-Marie, 3) why so much older (and less in-shape) a man would still be a trapeze artist, 4) why the couple seemed so puppyishly in love at the beginning, he to the point of slavishness, and 5) why "Boss" would be so jealous when Artinelli shows attentions to Berta.None of this is absolutely necessary to enjoy the film, however, which has beautifully detailed performances and terrific camerawork by Karl Freund. The trapeze sequences will leave you giddy. The montages of variety acts are witty and vibrant. Berlin nightlife in the '20s looks glamorous. And Jannings surely has one of the classic silent-screen actors' faces, eloquently conveying a wide spectrum of emotions."Variete" was a sensation when it appeared, primarily for its camerawork. At the time, director EA Dupont took most of the kudos and seemed launched on a promising career. But he was tapped out after his next flick, the estimable "Picadilly," and in retrospect, Freund is the creative force whose part in "Variete" assumes a place in a major body of film work. That being said, Dupont's work with the actors here is outstanding and a key part of the film's success. 
tt0016481;  Variete is a well-directed and well-acted morality play.  Chock full of cynical humor and ironic twists, it keeps your attention throughout in expert fashion until the last 20 minutes of the movie.  Then things unravel too quickly and too obviously to hit home with the intended impact of the final irony.  Still, I give it 7 out of 10. 
tt0016481; The Plot: Prologue: The murderer "Boss" Huller - after having spent ten years in prison - breaks his silence to tell the warden his story. "Boss", a former trapeze artist, and his wife own a cheap side-show that displays ''erotic sensations''. But he longs for his former glamorous life in the circus. When he meets the orphan Berta-Marie, he falls under her spell and leaves his wife and young son behind. He makes Berta-Marie his partner in a new trapeze number. One day, the famous trapeze artist Artinelli takes note of them and engages them for his trapeze show in Berlin. Their salto mortale becomes an immediate sensation. Calculatedly and cold, Artinelli seduces Berta-Marie and destroys "Boss'" happiness.If you are watching a version shorter than 112 minutes, you are watching the edited version. My screening was 83 minutes so I know there were lots of scenes cut out.Still, it's an interesting movie. Yes, the story line is dated, but I assume that was not the case back in 1925.The direction is really good.I found interest in watching how people lived back then. Smoking all the time indoors, the luggage used, the different acts at the circus (which, BTW, was not a circus as we know it today, more a vaudeville show).All the guys wear suits and ties and hats. A different time and place.Anyway..it's true that the story is not complex. And it's also true that the female lead is not especially attractive. Nor is she slim. And Jannings is laughably overweight to be an acrobat.The guy who is is stunt double for the acrobat scenes is literally 80 pounds lighter!Despite all...watch it for the cinematography! 
tt0016481; In 1915 Germany, burly trapeze artist Emil Jannings (as Stephan "Boss" Huller) leaves his wife and partner for sultry young Lya de Putti (as Berta-Marie). Soon, the carnival performing pair are hired by famed trapezist Warwick Ward (as Artinelli), after his flying brother is derailed by a fall. The high swinging threesome is an immediate success. But, after his trimmer partners begin to take care of their mutual attraction, Mr. Jannings must commit the crime for which he serves ten years in prison - as revealed in the present-day prologue. No doubt, it's going to get nastyÂ  Appearing decidedly middle-aged, and with his overweight figure impossible to disguise, Jannings is miscast to the point of ridiculous. But, he was so popular most viewers accepted Jannings as the trim athletic "catcher" flying high. For American consumption, Paramount left out Jannings' adulterous first act (and trimmed the remainder of the film). This softens Jannings' character, of course. The film cutters did leave in some flashes of female nipple. That, Jannings, and some great camera-work from Karl Freud made "VarietA©" a critical and commercial success in the US.****** VarietA© (11/16/25) E.A. Dupont ~ Emil Jannings, Lya de Putti, Warwick Ward, Maly Delschaft 
tt0016481;  Wonderful cinematagraphy and cutting influenced other films of the day. The story is old, but made interesting by the acting, sets and location shooting. The trapeze act shots are well worth seeing, though vaudeville and circus fans will be unhappy that there are few other acts shown. However, a 30 or 45 second summary of the variety (vaudeville) show is clever.The print I saw at New York's Museum of Modern Art did not have the 'prolog' either. Perhaps it was omitted when the film was released in the US.  
tt0016481; Among silent film conneisseurs Herr Ewald AndrA© Dupont is well-known for a trilogy of films, "VarietA©" (1925), "Moulin Rouge" (1928) und "Piccadilly" (1929), they all explore troubled relationships against a background of twenties popular entertainment (music-hall, cabarets, vaudeville). Of these, "VarietA©" is certainly the best and Herr Dupont's masterpiece, an excellent film that maintains intact its virtues and cinematic merits after so many years, This Herr Graf revisited it recently and found that it had lost none of its power.The love story involves Herr "Boss" Huller ( Herr Emil Jannings ) and the seductive orphan Frau Berta-Marie ( Fay Lya de Putti ) Once a famous trapeze artist, "Boss" has been reduced to managing a sordid fairground attraction together with his wife ( Frau Maly Delschaft ). He falls madly in love with Berta-Marie and seeks to start a new life with his lover, leaving his wife and child behind. The virtuosity in the dramatic use of the camera-work together with film narrative by Herr Dupont is simply great. Through the eyes of "Boss'", Dupont skilfully compares the young and vital Berta-Marie and the faded and worn wife. Later the camera shoots from behind Huller's back to depict a desperate man utterly defeated and broken. The expressive close-ups wherein hidden feelings are made transparent are also superb as is the portrait of the people of Berlin, inhabitants of a decadent but thrilling city. The frenzied nightlife of Weimar Berlin (Wintergarten, Vaudeville Theater, fairgrounds) is vividly captured by the camera-work of Herr Karl Freund und Herr Carl Hoffmann.The camera-work is especially impressive during the trapeze sequences wherein Herr Dupont, with the aid of optical special effects by Herr Ernst Kunstmann, employs many different camera angles to emphasize the riskiness of the trapeze act and the riskiness of the relationship between "Boss", Berta-Marie and their partner, the famous artist Herr Artinelli ( Herr Warwick Ward ) . The tension builds during the performance because we know that Herr "Boss" has discovered that Berte-Marie and Artinelli have become lovers.The actors are splendid, specially Herr Jannings who, when properly directed , can express powerfully the most inner and divergent human feelings, Frau Lya de Putti, is no femme fatale type at all but that certainly is the point, she's attractive enough but common, someone easily charmed by a stylish man like Herr Artinelli."VarietA©" is an exemplary work wherein all the achievements and virtuosity of German cinema of that time are on display. You have Expressionism intertwined with social comment, a fascinating portrait of the times. Dupont's wavers a bit at the end and allows a minor concession which is forgivable and by no means fatal to the film as a whole. And now, if you'll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must refuse a splendid offer to be a fairground attraction. 
tt0031680; A distressed Oriental woman comes knocking on the door of James Lee Wong seeking his help. Before we get to learn her request, she is murdered by a poisoned dart, fired through the open window of Wong's study. She is Princess Lin Hwa, a woman of high degree from the Wang-Ki family, as evidenced by a ring displaying her family crest.As in prior Mr. Wong films, James Lee Wong (Boris Karloff) is accompanied in his investigation by Police Captain Bill Street (Grant Withers), though he needn't bother, as the detective is mostly ineffective in getting any real police work done. It's Wong himself who develops his leads and is more effectively helped by Herald newspaper reporter Roberta Logan (Marjorie Reynolds), a somewhat romantic interest for Street, though she's pretty much pushed around by the Captain for most of the film, while maintaining a wry smile and quick wit to counteract the blustering bully.In her last minutes before dying, Lin Hwa manages to scribble a curiously worded "Captain J" on a piece of paper, pointing Wong to not one but two different but connected leads - Captain James of the steamship "Maid of the Orient", and Captain Guy Jackson (everybody's a Captain!) of the Phelps Aviation Company. It's revealed that the Princess was arranging for the sale of airplanes to her brother in China, but the two Captain J's were conspiring to rid her of her money without fulfilling their end of the bargain.The real villain behind the murders though is the outwardly helpful bank president Davidson (Huntley Gordon), having had access to Lin Hwa's bank account and freely forging checks to relieve her account of a million dollars. The giveaway - Davidson claimed to have had a vicious dog buried with an expensive headstone, but Wong correctly surmises that the grave actually conceals the body of a mute dwarf that was a friend of the Princess.Monogram Pictures released this movie in 1939, and later remade the film in 1947 with another Oriental Detective in the lead role, casting Roland Winters in his first screen appearance as Charlie Chan. "The Chinese Ring" is virtually a carbon copy of the Wong movie, with the "Captain J" clue changed by one letter to "Captain K". From there it moves along at pretty much the same pace until Chan's revelation of the killer. Both films are passable, but if you've seen one, you've seen both. 
tt0031680;               Princess Lin Hwa(Lotus Long) visits Mr. Wong (Boris Karloff) at his residence for assistance, however, she is killed by a poisoned arrow.  Mr. Wong, with Capt. Street (Grant Withers), seeks the murderer.  They are helped by Bobby Logan (Marjorie Reynolds), a reporter and Street's girfriend.  They arrive at the princess's apartment to investigate and look for clues, at the same time they find her maid has been murdered.  The only witness to the murder is a mute dwarf (Angelo Rosita) who mysteriously disappears.  Karloff held this picture together and has made this film a true Mr. Wong series classic for all Karloff fans.  It is difficult to critize this film, it was made with a very low budget and was considered a "B" film  in 1939, which was usually shown with another picture, news and a cartoon. Boris Karloff was between filming of horror movies and this Mr. Wong series gave him a small income.(not like the large salaries of movie stars today. However, Karloff is very calm and unmoved in this film and nothing seems to bother Mr. Wong at all!! 
tt0031680; Hugh Wiley's Chinese detective Mr. Wong(Boris Karloff)finds a pretty Chinese Princess Lin Hwa(Lotus Long)dead on his study floor. Why did someone shoot the poison dart that killed her? An enterprising and attractive female newspaper reporter, Bobbie Logan(Marjorie Reynolds), seems to keep getting in the way of Wong and Police Captain Street's(Grant Withers)investigation. It is discovered that Princess Lin Hwa came to San Francisco's Chinatown to purchase airplanes to help defend her homeland. And embezzlers find it hard to outsmart Mr. Wong. This low budget movie from Monogram runs 71 minutes with Mr. Wong as a poor man's Charlie Chan. Also in the cast: Huntley Gordon, James Flavin and Bessie Loo. 
tt0031680; 'Mr. Wong in Chinatown' is quiet but lively. Good movie, dramatic, atmospheric, suspenseful, a genuine mystery chiller, with one scene set in Chinatown (so don't expect much about colorful exotic shocker, yet the Chinese princess had charm and appeal), and the rest in offices, houses, etc., it's also a screwball. Karloff plays Wong as a good-natured gentleman, and he sometimes resembles a bit Irons, Wong puts few questions, and sometimes needs help (he's rescued by the girl in this movie), Wong meets some really tough businessmen, who do not hesitate before the strongest measures, and his visit to the Chinese oldsters is nice, but Wong's two pals, the policeman and the newspaper girl, provide good roles. The screwball is funny. Wong, charming, soft-spoken, mild, reasonably streetwise, would of made an actor's career, but Karloff did so many interesting performances, that this one got less love. I missed such an old mystery movie, and this one did charm me. In these old movies, they disposed easily of secondary characters (like Carradine in a Moto outing, and the dwarf here), not to mention bit players and lesser parts. These movies were like episodes of the serials they made once, but on a bigger budget perhaps. 
tt0031680; A Chinese princess coming to Mr. Wong for help is killed in his home by a poisoned dart. This movie introduces a clichA©d nosy reporter character, Bobbie Logan, played by the beautiful Marjorie Reynolds. She would appear in the rest of the Wong films. I take it as a sign they knew the Wong series wasn't working quite right and felt it needed some more side characters. Perhaps they just wanted to rip off Torchy Blane. Who knows? Grant Withers returns as Captain Street. He doesn't bark as much as he usually does, except when Bobbie's around. She's his girlfriend and he wants her to stay out of trouble. Another Torchy Blane similarity. Curiously, 1939 was also the year Torchy Blane in Chinatown was released. This is a watchable movie, as all the Wongs are, but nothing special. 
tt0031680; For Boris Karloff fans Mr Wong in Chinatown makes for good curiosity value and has good things that makes it a little more than that. Mr Wong in Chinatown is far from bad and Karloff has certainly done worse(look at the Mexican films he did) but he has also done better and deserved better. If asked whether Mr Wong in Chinatown is recommended, I'd say yes but only partially. There are some good things, Karloff is still commanding and gives a very good performance(as said many times by me one of those actors that gave his all regardless of the material). Marjorie Reynolds is the other, and in a way only other, standout in the cast, she brings a great deal of sass to Logan and really spices things up but deserved better material to do so more. Some of the sparring-constant- between her and Grant Withers is entertaining. The closing gag is great. The music has its jauntiness and eeriness. The sets are appropriate and nicely done. And Lotus Long while killed off quickly, perhaps too quickly, she makes for a sensual presence and makes things promising to begin with. However, while the sparring between Reynolds and Withers is fun their chemistry could have been better, aside from their dialogue the chemistry doesn't gel. And Withers to me is the problem, his performance more scenery-chewing rather than subtle and often of the worst kind, the shouting and frozen facial expressions did get annoying after a while. The photography is serviceable but could have been more fluid, the low-budget does show. Outside of the verbal sparring and the closing gag, the dialogue does come across as stilted and could have developed things more. The story shows good potential but peters out after the beginning but picks up at the final solution, which is a nice surprise, the mystery did feel weak because of the dull pacing(the film did feel longer than it was), lack of suspense and tension, the lacking dialogue and that really only two performances stood out. It also got very routine and didn't contain that many surprises. In conclusion, a watchable film with interest points but not great, one of the weaker entries of the series. 5.5/10 Bethany Cox 
tt0031680; Mr. Wong in Chinatown (1939)I've seen a number of these Boris Karloff movies where he plays the Chinese detective Mr. Wong, and I can never quite get used to the idea that they cast Karloff in that role. Oddly, he's the best part of the series (he was a great actor, really, going far beyond being a great Monster.There was the potential at first for some pre-WWII intrigue, because the key element behind the murders with the poison darts is a shipment of airplanes (which seem a bit tricky to smuggle, but whatever). Nothing really comes of it, however. Strickly low budget.For a full intro to the series, check out this very nice site: cheddarbay.com/0000celebrityfiles/films/wong/wong.htmlThis one is a routine affair, with the chipper female reporter to spice up the dialog. I'm not sure I'd recommend it in particular! 
tt0031680; Poor Lotus Long the oriental actress who got murdered in two Mr. Wong vehicles. In Mr. Wong In Chinatown she no longer arrives at Boris Karloff's home when she's killed with a poison dart fired through the window of his study.Probably because the victim was Chinese, Mr. Wong would have gotten involved in any case, but won't these movie villains ever learn? Doing it that way was an open invitation.Lotus lives long enough to leave a written cryptic clue and Karloff and police captain Grant Withers go chasing leads. The victim was a Chinese princess in town allegedly to buy airplanes for her country during war time. The clue itself by the way turns out to be a bit of a red herring.Mr. Wong In Chinatown marks the first appearance of Marjorie Reynolds in this series as Withers's pesky reporter girl friend. Reynolds is in the snoop and scoop Lois Lane school of journalism. She actually does prove useful, more at times than Myrna Loy was to William Powell.But this is Monogram, not MGM so the production values are really on the cheap here. Still for that studio this isn't a bad film. 
tt0031680;  It certainly doesn't waste any time getting started: the murder occurs in the first three minutes, and in Mr.Wong's house, no less! And with the always dependable and dignified Boris Karloff in the title role again, you'd think this could develop in a pretty interesting mystery. Wrong! This film is tremendously boring. Mr.Wong has boring conversations with boring suspects who have boring motives. I had stated once that every whodunit is inherently interesting if it is at least executed with a minimum level of competence...this film proves the importance of the "competence" part. 1 star out of 4, strictly for Karloff.  
tt0031680; I've seen several Mr. Wong films and I can definitely understand why Monogram Studios decided to drop the series in favor of making Charlie Chan films. Unlike the Chan films, the Wong series is pretty dull--with unlikable or bland supporting characters and a very low energy level in the movies. It's like the characters are just walking through the lines and putting little into it--particularly Boris Karloff, who was capable of so much better work than this. His supporting characters don't help, as Grant Withers is a pretty dull police inspector and Marjorie Reynolds in her first of four appearances in the Wong series as the nosy reporter is a tad annoying.The film begins with a Chinese princess coming to Wong's house. When his butler goes to get Wong, an unseen person kills the lady with a poisonous dart! It turns out that the princess was in America to buy planes for their war with the Japanese, though since the US was not yet at war with Japan, they were never mentioned by name. Why she was killed and unable to complete her mission is mildly interesting, but that's about all. My advice is try to see a different B-detective series, such as Sherlock Holmes, The Falcon or Charlie Chan--they are just a lot more interesting and fun to watch. 
tt0104012; Italy went through a wave of kidnapping not long ago where wealthy citizens, or their children, were taken away by professional bandits. Most of the people behind this type of crime were from the Calabria area. In fact, it was an industry where some poor people without scruples stood to make a lot of money by extorting rich Italians with the crime they were committing. These evil men would keep the unfortunate victims hidden and would only return them to their families when they received payment. Some times the kidnappers killed their prey when something went wrong.The film concentrates on two enemy families of kidnappers. When Vito's father kills two opposing members of another gang, their family comes to get revenge and kills six members of the young boy's family. Vito runs away to go look for a brother at a cave, where he discovers a boy, who has been kidnapped, lying dead. When he discovered the boy, he also found a knapsack with an address printed in it, which he assumes is the dead boy's.The film follows Vito as he flees from the enemy that wants to kill him in amazing fashion. This peasant boy, who probably hasn't left his backward area, finds uncanny ways to avoid being killed and outsmarts the guys that are pursuing him. Eventually, he ends up at the house of the dead boy, where the distraught mother believes her kidnapped son has returned home, to the horror of her husband, who sees the truth.This Italian film, directed by Carlo Carlei, is a document about that era of that tragic period in the country. Mr. Carlei paces his story well in the way he sets the chase of the boy as he tries to evade his pursuers. Manuel Colao is perfect as the young boy. Francesca Neri and Jacques Perrin are seen as the parents of the kidnapped boy.The film will not disappoint because it shows the sure hand of a director, Carlo Carlei, who takes us for an exciting ride. 
tt0104012;  Corsa means race. And this is one of epic dimensions. It is interesting to point out that Carlo Carlei, the director, was in his first effort at the time.As a director myself, I find some of the many runs of Vito a bit over the top. But, at the same time, I must admit that the scarcity of dialogue and the stupor in Vito's attitude is alluring and simply unnerving.This is a film that uses in a very effective way the dramatic and cinematic expression of Panavision. This format is completely accepted as the de facto standard for any major release. But the complexities of using this format in a story that will be told through the eyes of a child is not easy.The superb landscapes and contrasts that make this film as visually stunning and as dark as it is is not a small achievement for a first film. Actually, it's quite unbelievable this is a first directorial job.The natural settings and lighting give, to some scenes, a beautiful psychological break within all the violence and desperation the main character experiences.But, above all, this film is effective. It takes the audience completely off-balance and never lets it go. It's gripping. Even with some really redundant scenes and not so believable twists. But we have to remember that for some dramatic purposes, these twists are a valid resource.Music becomes almost a character in a very unobtrusive form, and I like the sparse passages of really weird and doom-reminding sounds.The language is beautiful, even when the boy and his family speak with a very tight lilt  -true to their land. I only object to the incredibly bad voice-over of the only french actor, it's a voice that is as unconvincing as if the man was talking with Hugh Grant's voice.Even when all the slo-mo scenes are masterfully planned and shot, the violence is overwhelming. I wouldn't be that explicit, but -then again, this leads the audience to the unexpected with such a speed that it is pretty justified.All in all, La Corsa... is a riveting film. Manuel Colao's performance and beauty are all the more enticing within such a dark subject matter.  
tt0104012;  (Plot spoilers ahead.) Violence erupts in a shepherd's field in the Italian region of Calabria. Several men are shot and killed.  Later the entire family of the men responsible for the slaughter is itself brutally wiped out in a revenge massacre, except for the young Vito, hiding under the mattress of a bed.  He spends the rest of the movie evading his family's murderers, who need to get him out of the way.Vito realizes his own family was part of a kidnapping crime involving a young boy (son of wealthy Sienese parents).  The two murderous and murdered crime families had clashed over the issue. The kidnapped child has been killed, but the surviving criminals still want to collect the ransom, asserting that the child is alive.  Vito runs away, on foot, by train and truck, any way he can, seeks sanctuary with a relative in Rome (and his girlfriend), until he too is killed. He is questioned by the police, sent to a safe haven, apprehended by a gang member, escapes, continues his noble quest to seek the parents of the slain boy, to tell them what happened, to return to them the ransom money he had found, to tell them not to pay a ransom because their son is dead.  At heart he is engaged in a quest to seek new loving replacement parents, to become a substitute son to "replace" the son the Sienese couple has lost.He finds the family's home, with information found in the kidnapped child's bookbag. He barges into the house. The lost child's mother (Francesca Neri) finds this young intruder, takes a liking to the lad, going so far as tenderly bathing the boy and outfitting him with her missing son's clothes.  The father (Jacques Perrin) refuses to believe his boy is dead, and negotiates with those still seeking the ransom.   This final confrontation between father and criminals causes Vito to be nearly killedÂ but because of him the villains are subsequently snuffed out by the police in a final violent shootout.Vito dreams of a world where all can live in harmony, children are safe, and blood feuds are unknown.  Would that were so. This is a beautifully made film with moments of great excitement and tension and sudden bursts of extreme violence and slaughter that look like out-takes from Sam Peckinpah's "The Wild Bunch."   Nevertheless, there is a tenderness at the core of the film, which is often very lyrical, sometimes excessively so in long-winded dreamy evocations that pop up from time to timeÂ and at the ending.  In short, it's a good thriller, with a humane dimension, on a relatively rare topic, the Calabrian Â<U+0091>Ndrangheta and its record of child-kidnappings.Performances are uniformly convincing with the remarkable Manuel Colao as the sweetly poetic and shrewdly cautious youngster.  Jacques Perrin and Francesca Neri as the kidnapped kid's parents are perfect, and Federico Pacifici is frightening as the deranged scarfaced killer.  The direction by Carlo Carlei, whose first film this was, is top-notch.I used to show this film to high school students of Italian, despite the R-rating (for violence) and it invariably went over very well with the teen audiences. It is of interest to note that the 2003 Italian film "I'm Not Scared" ("Io non ho paura") by Gabriele Salvatores, has a story with a number of similarities to this one.    
tt0104012; If you are looking for a movie that has a great story, well done acting,fantastic direction and a score that will give you goosebumps when you hear it, look no further Flight of the Innocent is a Masterpiece of pure action and excitement.I have just finished viewing this movie for the fifth time and I am still not bored with it. I am writing this review now since I have just found out that it has finally been released on DVD, which now is probably the best chance to view this movie better at home.I have this movie on video bought years ago when it came out and the movie although now 10 years old has not aged a bit. One reviewer asked where the boy got hold of the address, without give any details away about the plot,I would like to point out that the address was written on the boy's bag.Like I stated before, I have seen this movie more than once and the movie has no plot holes at all. The movie is quite violent especially the shootings, but also a very intelligent one that grabs the viewer from the very start and never lets go.Take note of this movie and if you see it at your local DVD store give it a rent. You will not be disappointed. 10/10 
tt0104012;  Jtur has a fair point, you could add that the picture never shows how young Vito obtains the address of his goal---but this is a parable, not a New Realism movie with peasants employed as actors. The most striking feature of this highly cinematic picture is that for the whole 101 minutes it has little dialogue. You could write the lines on a couple of pages. It cuts to the chase in the first 30 seconds, and never stops. At the climactic moment, when the young hero bursts into speech for the first time, putting his own life on the line and thereby redeeming his whole murdered criminal family, it has marvellous dramatic, emotional and philosophical impact, nobly underlined by the literary epitaph. Somehow, I can't see the Disney organisation taking on a big issue and dramatically working out its theme in this way. Flight of the Innocent is so well structured. Every 10 minutes, there is a plot point, and it certainly has no "sagging centre"---an exceptional achievement in any picture. The boy just runs and runs and runs, until he is in the arms of---well, don't let's spoil the story, because this is a passionate statement about a genuine horror of southern Italian life, and well worth seeing.   
tt0104012;  Honestly is one of my all time 10 best italian movies ever. I cant understand how a director like Carlo Carlei it`s not working in Hollywood after this one, like G.Tornattore o R.Bennigni this movie is a great movie and also very original, touching and well shooted. E X C E L E N T italian movie E X E L E N T Carlei "avanti caro" 
tt0104012; Oh how i wish i could save people from watching this film. It is sooooo cheesy, soo over the top, i wanted to laugh, as in a serge leone film, but unfortunately the director here was dead serious. arggggh. felt like a series of commercials. ALL it had going for it, and I mean ALL, was some beautiful scenery shots including some great Roman buildings. Other than that, if you are a sophisticated film goer,you will buck at the melodramatic schmaltz (both of the repeated shots of bloody murders, the repetitive slow motion shots of bloody deaths, and the light-filtering-in-the gauzy- child's- bedroom shots with the vaseline- coated lens.) Fortunately I could fast forward through all the stupid predictable dreck.If I save one person from watching this, i will feel so much better. 
tt0104012; Although from a cinematography the production is good, the story and the actors are in doubt. First the story: it is about a kid from a crime family in the deep south that escapes from a deeply agrarian society to the heavily services-oriented north. Well, sorry to tell you, but the deep south as it is mythologized in the Godfather movies, doesn't exist anymore. Everybody has a cellphone now, nobody wants to be a Sheppard anymore, everybody wants to have an office job. The story is highly simplistic and idiomatic, kind of a cute story of a sweet looking kid with bad guys around him. Then the actors: the parents of the kidnapped child are "acting" the part that it is so obvious. When they see the child's school backpack, the knee to it, pick it up, and embrace it. So obvious, that it is classic "B" movie, and so predictable, more for a melodrama aired in soap-opera afternoons. Even how the director directed the shots has some unnatural feel: when the kid emerges from the crypt in the cemetery, he is made to turn his head slightly and then express surprise to discover there is a vehicle. It is as if the kid didn't have peripheral vision. Such scene direction by putting emphasis on frontal screen scape is typical of television direction of simple and uncomplicated easy-to-do productions. To have it here just shows how simplistic that was. But it was the only time it happened, otherwise, the other scenes are more dynamic 
tt0104012;  This film was a bit too Disneyesque for me.  The requisite beautiful child, equipped with intellect, wisdom, incredible luck---everything but a dog. With three years of school, he reads remarkably well.  Fresh from a Sicilian olive orchard, he's street wise enough to have Rome eating out of his hand. He's the only target that's too small for the bad guys to hit unerringly with every shot.  To make matters worse, befouled with needlessly explicit violence, which kicks it out of the Disney Channel, straight into Action-Max. 
tt0396735; Magic Kitchen (Moh waan chue fong) has got a cast of beautiful people and a fun convoluted plot told in flashbacks from a few times, moods and perspectives. You will either love or hate that way of telling a story.It is a story of how a circle of lifetime friends from kindergarten support each other and negotiate the sticky points of being adult and in the search for a partner or true love. It doesn't fit squarely into drama, comedy or romance genres, while having moments for all of them. While it makes social commentary on this age's shape of love and dating relationships, it is light, falling just short of fluffy. It is sort of a watered down version of Like Water for Chocolate so far as the aspects of chef and cooking goes. The movie has definite parallels to the movie Woman on Top, with a chef, quirky unexpected plot turns, the bit of the surreal, and a woman who would be ditsy if she weren't so loved and smart. I liked this one better than the Penelope Cruz one because Magic Kitchen struck me as having far more believable characters, less sanitized view of choices in relationships, with less of a pat fairytale ending. It's soundtrack isn't intrusive. It's cinematography doesn't take center stage but these things are considered. In the subtitles, it would have been handy in a couple places if the print on screen would have been translated not only the spoken words. 
tt0396735;  Moh waan chue fong or its English title Magical Kitchen is the latest Hong Kong movie in offering for the lunar new year. However, there is not a single mood or occasion of a Chinese new year movie in it. I should say this movie is much better for a Christmas fare or Valentine's date movie.Yau (Sammi Cheng) is a successful chef and owner of a restaurant which is located in a flat called Magical Kitchen which is more like a home rather than like a restaurant. In a tale told by Yau's mother, that she would be haunted by a family curse overshadowing three generations, which destines her (Yau) to fail in every relationship. On a tour of the Iron Chef TV show in Japan, Yau is at the crossroads between her love life and career.To spice up the this "dish" (movie), we have Yau's assistant chef, Ho played by the hunky Jerry Yan of the fame popular Taiwan teen-throb quartet, F4. Yan is secretly in love with Yau but doesn't have the guts to express to his 'boss'. Next comes in the picture is Yau's former boyfriend, Chun Yao (Andy Lau) who is a sports goods company operations manager and a bowling expert. Further throw in two girlfriends of Yau, played by Maggie Q and Nicola Cheung, and you have a relationship roller-coaster ride.Sammi plays her usual unpredictable self similar to her previous movies such as Love on a Diet, Good times Bed times and Needing You. Still she's a delight to watch. The same, however cannot be said about Jerry, who is extremely wooden here, and shares little or no chemistry with Sammi. Perhaps we got to blame the casting here as with one look at it we will feel it's a mismatched couples in all the roles.If the name Magic Kitchen would have made you thought of some sort of a similar cooking stunts like Stephen Chow's The God of Cookery then you would be truly disappointed. Nothing unusual or special dish were being cooked up. At best, Magic Kitchen is good for a few laughs and the chance to see so many good looking actors (as well as other famous actors in cameos) on the big screen. But story-wise, it's wasted. 
tt0067084; Duccio Tessari is probably best known as the director of several Spaghetti Westerns, most prominently the "Ringo" films with Giuliano Gemma, as well as the well-known Italian Crime flick "Tony Arzenta". The man also served as an (uncredited) co-writer of Sergio Leone's Italian Western milestone "Fistful of Dollars", and as a writer of several sword and sandal films in the early 60s. As a director, Tessari's doubtlessly best films are his two intelligent and plot-driven Gialli, "L'Uomo Senza Memoria" (aka. "The Man Without Memory", 1974) and this gem. "Una Farfalla Con Le Ali Insanguiante" aka. "Bloodstained Butterfly" of 1971 is a terrific, beauty- and suspenseful example for a purely plot-based Giallo that profits from an excellent cast, a great score, wonderful settings and a sublime cinematography. As it is the case with Tessari's other Giallo, "The Man Without Memory", "Bloodstained Butterfly" is a Giallo that focuses on the Mystery more than the Horror-elements of the genre. And the film is indeed a perfectly constructed puzzle of a mystery that is (though convoluted) always easy to follow.When a French exchange student (Carole AndrA©) is murdered by multiple stabbing in a park in Bergamo, the police arrest TV anchor Marchi (Giancarlo Sbragia). Marchi's daughter Sarah (Wendy D'Olive), who was friends with the murdered girl, does not believe in her father's guilt... As said above, this is a purely story-driven Giallo. For genre-standards, there are only very few murders and very little gore. The film is very suspenseful, however, and delivers mystery and innovative twists from the beginning to the end, as a good Giallo should. The beautiful Bergamo locations are a wonderful setting for the film, which is furthermore (in good Giallo-tradition) brilliantly photographed. The beautiful score intensifies the atmosphere, and the film profits from a very good ensemble cast. The characters are all complex and elaborate. The always-sinister Helmut Berger and Italian Grenre-cinema regulars such as Ida Galli ("The Case Of The Scorpion's Tail"), GA1nter Stoll ("What Have They Done To Solange"), Silvano Tranquilli ("The Black Belly of The Tarantula"), and Giancarlo Sbragia ("Tony Arzenta") all deliver very good performances. As said, for a Giallo this features little violence and gore and also little sleaze, but the magnificently elaborate plot should be more than pleasant to Genre-fans. "Bloodstained Butterfly" is beautifully filmed with a lot of style, and highly recommended to my fellow Giallo-fans. 
tt0067084; I must say that after hearing nothing but good things about this film I was a little disappointed. While I wouldn't call this a bad film, I didn't think it was anything special. With all the great gialli out there I don't understand how this one gets so much praise. Maybe I'm missing something... Perhaps if I went into it with lower expectations I would have enjoyed it more.I felt like it spends too much time on the police/investigation side of the spectrum for my tastes. I would agree with the other reviewers in that this is a more "serious" toned giallo than most. Overall though, I found the film to be pretty forgettable upon my first viewing.***POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD*** The "whodunit" element is enjoyable, with all the twists and turns you come to expect from the genre. It also has a pretty sleazy bit where the attorney tries to have sex with the daughter of the woman he is having an affair with, who happens to be the wife of the accused killer he is defending in the first half of the film. 
tt0067084;  Though Mario Bava had gotten the Giallo ball rolling in 1964 with "Blood And Black Lace" (though some may argue that it was really 1962's "Evil Eye/ The Girl Who New Too Much" that was really the first Giallo), it wasn't really until Dario Argento's 1969 masterpiece "The Bird With The Crystal Plumage" that started the Italian Production trend. But between 1970 to 1972 it was in it's full swing!They must have been throwing these films out weekly! But Duccio Tessari's 1971 Giallo "The Bloodstained Butterfly" is a standout for many reasons. First it takes a slightly different approach in it's proceedings, anouncing the characters names like an Agatha Christie thriller. It contains a lush hypnotic soundtrack supplied by Gianni Ferrio (that blends out of a jarring Tchaikovsky number), that fits in snuggly with Ennio Morricone's doodlings (yet retains it's own originality). The entire cast is solid, with Helmut Berger's Giorgio (a pianist) going mental every time he hears Tchaikovsky, and Giancarlo Sbragia (the main suspect) looking timid (yet shifty) while trying to defend himself.  Red herrings abound (everyone seems slightly guilty and slimey) the story weaves a web of perplexity until the surprising (or not so surprising if you've seen enough Giallos) climax. Dementia out of passion is called into explanation, and this is not just your regular moral avenger or greedy interloper Giallo. Beautiful Wendy D'Olive plays the daughter of the suspect (the only character who isn't dipped in slime), and one can't help but feel that this poor character will probably suffer a nervous breakdown at the end of the chaos. To give away the story would be a crime, because this is what keeps the interest jumping. Again the black gloved assassin is taking the lives of beautiful women, but this tends to feel like a more mature outing with restrained gore. The emphasis is placed on the convoluted, puzzling story. One thing that makes Giallo films so great is that it's stylized trash. Not simply just stalk n' slash fair (unlike so many of America's horror films of the time), but great detail is placed on locations, clothes, interior decoration, and music. Giallo films tend to seduce (before destroying) it's viewer with everything abound incorporating a lushous veneer."Bloodstained Butterfly" is a prime example of this asthetic. One of my favourite moments of the film is when Wendy D'Olive is taking a tram through the city, while Helmut Berger is driving his sports car right before their chance (or maybe it isn't?) meeting. The wonderful music glides you through the scene like an Italian daydream, only to drop you into a scene of suspicion. Highly recommended for fans of Italian Cinema!
tt0067084;  I just picked this little gem up recently and had the pleasure of finding out what a great film this is.  I was unfamiliar with the director, and wasn't sure what to expect.  The film is filled with clever camera work and symbolism.  The soundtrack too is wonderful.  I did not miss the mighty Morricone while watching this giallo.  Morricone has scored many films like this and has created a style all his own for these sort of films.  Even though I noticed some Morricone-like melodies, the score overall was original, with well placed moments of Tchaikovsky's piano concerto.  If you have already seen all the Argento, Fulci and Bava giallos, then by all means do not miss this one! 
tt0067084; Very fine, if slightly unusual giallo. Unusual in the sense that this is far more serious than one might expect and the 'in your face' violence is less evident. This might have made the film less fun, especially as there is a fair amount of time spent following police procedures, plus courtroom scenes! But, it all works and one is totally involved from the killing at the start. There is not a lot of death but we see this first one several times through different people's eyes and the film holds together remarkably well, helped along by a great soundtrack, some of it Morricone. The film moves at a very good pace and even the police comings and goings and the trial are handled very well and if the ending seems a bit abrupt I think that is because it really is a bit of a surprise. Excellent stuff and a very good intro to the wonderful world of giallo. 
tt0067084;  One of the best gialli to come out of Italy in the 1969-77 period, it's very stylish and (of course) convoluted, but always interesting and ultimately quite clever. For once the solution to the mystery actually matters (and makes sense!), and the motive behind the murders and the finale are worthy of Agatha Christie. I highly recommend it. Great soundtrack too, I just bought the CD. 
tt0067084; I only heard about this giallo recently, but it's undoubtedly one of the best examples of the subgenre that I've watched. Besides, from the little I've checked out of Tessari's work so far (incidentally, I've just recorded his Spaghetti Western A PISTOL FOR RINGO [1965] - which I'll catch up with soon enough), it's easily his most significant effort, I should also be getting to PUZZLE (1974), another giallo of his, in the near future.THE BLOODSTAINED BUTTERFLY (as ever, the title is only peripheral to the main narrative) - which opens with an identification of all the major characters - is especially notable for its complex editing structure, with details of plot related throughout in abrupt flashes (as either part of a lengthy trial sequence, which occupies the majority of its first half, or during troubled lead Helmut Berger's regular fits, which remain unexplained till the finale). While characterization is somewhat aloof (with no real female counterpart to Berger, despite a fair number of women in the cast), the principal actors are well chosen and also include such familiar Euro-Cult faces as Carole Andre' (playing a murdered victim), Evelyn Stewart (the wife of the suspected killer), Silvano Tranquilli (the police detective assigned to the case) and Wolfgang Preiss (the prosecuting attorney).The narrative is a bit on the seamy side - encompassing (if ever so discreetly) rape, infidelity, paedophelia, pornography, prostitution, etc. - but welcome comedy relief is provided by the interaction between the flustered Tranquilli and his long-suffering junior partner. Unlike many films of its ilk, the audience is kept guessing as to the identity of the villain up to the violent climax (resulting in a curt but satisfyingly bleak ending) and, just as thankfully, the script dispenses with the idea (popularized by Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO [1960]) of presenting a forced last-minute explanation - wherein a psychiatrist is appointed to dig into the killer's past, in order to extract some lame motive for his misdeeds. Typically, however, the eclectic score (courtesy of Gianni Ferrio) is masterful - especially in the way a Tchaikovsky symphony is seamlessly woven into the soundtrack!The film is available on a bare-bones DVD from both Italy and Spain - but it more than merits a decent release in R1 through, say, Blue Underground (given their predilection for such "Euro-Cult" offerings)... 
tt0067084; A girl is murdered in a park. A suspect is tried and convicted but the killings continue.The Bloodstained Butterfly is a giallo that occupies the more restrained side of the genre. Despite having a plot revolving around a series of knife murders, it doesn't really focus on these killings. One is shown briefly in flash-back, while the others are essentially committed off-screen. Instead, the narrative concentrates more on the mystery. For this reason it is on the more sober and intelligent side of the giallo genre. Quite a bit of the story is taken up with the police procedural angle and court-room scenes. And similar to many others in the sub-genre, an intense melodrama underpins the murder mystery, and, as is often the case, it's populated by a group of quite unsympathetic people. These are made up with the usual concoction of the psychologically troubled and the sleazily untrustworthy.While the emphasis on melodrama and detective/courtroom dynamics might not be to everyone's taste, it works here. The mystery is compelling and you are kept guessing all the way. I can't say I predicted the outcome either, which is always a bonus. But in amongst all of this are some great typical giallo moments such as the opening scenes in the park with the killer making a get away shot from a number of nice angles. In general, as you might expect from this type of film it is photographed well throughout and has a good soundtrack too. It also has a somewhat unusual opening credit sequence where we are introduced to all of the main characters where they are shown with their moniker displayed on screen. This is quite good, as these films almost always have convoluted plot-lines and this helps ease us into proceedings with a quick look at whose who in the film about to start.The Bloodstained Butterfly is overall a pretty involving mystery. It isn't a horror-orientated thriller at all though, so if that's what you're after you'd be best looking elsewhere. But it has the specific mood and essence that early 70's gialli have. If you're a fan of the sub-genre you should check this one out. 
tt0067084;  A young pianist, Giorgio, has kept his highly delicate happiness only by having his girl friend, Francoise, and therefore when someone stabs  her to death at a park everything is badly changed. Although the police arrests a middle-aged man named Alessandro as the primal suspect of the murder case, Giorgio isn't and can't be satisfied with the judicial system itself any longer. But the whole situation becomes more complex when he meets a girl, Sarah, who is a daughter of Alessandro... This Italian film begins not only with the highly impressive music by Gianni Ferrio but also with the unusual visual introduction of its eight major characters, namely, Marta, Francoise, Sarah, Maria(mother of Sarah), Alessandro(husband of Maria), Giulio(lawyer), Giorgio, and Eriprando(father of Giorgio). Needless to say, Mario Bava did same kind of thing in his 1964 classic SEI DONNE PER L'ASSASINO, but in contrast to its expandability the introduction part of this film limits its own story and therefore one can easily expect the self-limited story is ongoing almost exclusively among the eight characters. Indeed one can even say every part of this film is trying to almost minimalistically exclude any kind of cinematic unexpectablity. And this seems to be one of the reasons why this film is not always loved by so-called Giallo lovers. Leaving from that question, this film is definitely not so-called Gestalt psychological and therefore one can and should realise that, at least in this film, not only music and/or musical event per se isn't and can't be emotion(s) but also music and/or musical event per se doesn't and can't have emotion(s), it merely indicates emotion(s). And this is the very reason why Giorgio chooses the unfamiliar gun instead of the familiar piano. Indeed I believe this anti-Gestalt-psychology, which does not allow for various players and/or listeners to have different emotional interpretations of the same music and/or musical event, is the most unique and powerful side this film has. And regarding the film's tile, THE BLOODSTAINED BUTTERFLY, has its own importance. Giorgio had given Francoise the present of a blue-butterfly-figured pendant. And when Francoise was murdered the butterfly was, at least symbolically, stained with her blood. And latter when Giorgio begins to take the law into his own hands the now-invisible-butterfly becomes to be stained not only with the problematic murderer's blood but also with Giorgio's own blood. I think this film as a whole is an almost unusually serious and realistically-oriented film with its own high-quality, whether it per se is Giallo or not.  
tt0067084;  I recently watched this movie first time and it hasn't everything that I was hoped for. Plot was too average, with some giallo twists, but too scattered. In one point, I thought movie turns out to be courtroom drama (it reminded me 'Sacco e Vanzetti'). Another thing I'm used to see in giallos is even couple of violent scenes. Lack of those (well there is some violence in the movie, but it isn't very graphical, when compared to eg. Dario Argento's or Lucio Fulci's giallos) made me very actually very unsatisfied with whole movie. Even so, movie wasn't all that bad. Soundtrack was more than nice and ending was very unpredictable. So, overall: 6/10 
tt0038038;  A long but pleasantly sentimental journey. This delightfully odd-ball film is based on the real-life story of one Louise Randall Pierson, an eccentric free-spirited woman who was ahead of her time in her thinking and actions. This lady didn't need the assistance of women's liberation movement!  The film opens in 1912 and ends during WWII.  In between are many amusing episodes. Louise's first failed marriage, her daughter who suffered infantile paralysis and her introduction to her future second husband (Jack Carson) - in a fish pond while dressed up for a costume party linger in the memory.  Rosalind Russell is superb as Ms Randall-Pierson, and although the film is a mite long at 117 minutes, it is expertly directed by Michael Curtiz, the dramatic and comical aspects being cleverly balanced. Highly recommended as a fine example of a forgotten fine movie to remember. 
tt0038038;  Rosalind Russell plays Louise Randall Pierson (someone I've never heard of, but this is based on her autobiography). Directed by Michael Curtiz, it showcases Russell and the often underrated Jack Carson as they face financial feast and famine and an ever-expanding family.  Russell is tough, and unapologetic, and Carson is her equal.  The film, coming from 1945, has a strange cliff hanging effect, as it ends with the beginning of World War II, and you wonder what will happen next. At the time it must have hit home for a lot of families with men (and women) fighting overseas. But I would strongly recommend it as a movie to watch before the films "Since You Went Away", with Claudette Colbert which chronicles life at home during the war, and "Best Years of Their Lives", which is probably the best coming-home-from-war film ever made. The three would make a great sequential view of life from the turn of the century to post WWII America. 8.5 out of 10. 
tt0038038; Louise Randall Pierson lived a wonderful life. Mrs. Pierson was a woman ahead of her times. Her biggest accomplishment was a total dedication to her family. The film, based on her own autobiography, clearly shows why this woman was so unique. Michael Curtiz directed with his usual flair.Louise Randall Pierson went from a childhood of privilege to almost poverty after her father died when she was still a girl. Louise pursues a career as a typist and joins a firm where no women had been employed. Her friendship with Alice Abbott brings her to New Haven where she meets and marries a man that never amounts to anything, but who leaves her for another woman without any qualms, leaving Louise to do whatever she can with four small children.At this point in her life, she meets Harold Pierson, a lovable man who had big visions, but who never was able to have the recognition he deserved. Louise and Harold were made for one another. Their love will get them through some rough patches, but they manage to keep their spirits and give all the children careers of their own.Rosalind Russell makes this film come alive. Ms. Russell was such a lovable actress that no matter what she appeared in, she always managed to please us. Jack Carson, an underrated actor, was perfect as her second husband Harold Pierson. Mr. Carson and Ms. Russell seem to be having a great time while making the movie. Ann Doran is the loyal friend Alice and Ann Todd plays the young Louise."Roughly Speaking" is one of the most positive films that came out of Hollywood in the forties because it shows us a determined woman with a great heart who raises above of what life gave her. 
tt0038038; Long after this movie's release, the term "Slice of Life" was coined to describe films such as this. I dislike labels, and I especially tend to dislike modern films for which this term was coined. However, it seems like an apt label for this movie which I paradoxically love. (This comment provides as much insight into film history as it does into my own character.) I admit to being a sentimentalist. Consequently Slice of Life films from the thirties to the late forties usually appeal to me far more than later films. A lot of Slice of Life movies since the late forties seem to me to be rather pointless, rather tragic - or worse - both! Like any art form, films express the ethos of the culture in which they are made. I sometimes lament the passing of the society that produced Slice of Life films from the thirties to the late forties...Roughly Speaking is a film that is full of tragic events, but none seem pointless or even tragic. In that sense it is moralistic. As their dialog during the film's fadeout clearly indicates, Rosalind Russell and Jack Carson seem made for each other in their twin indomitable spirits. That spirit imbues this entire film with optimism. If the film seems at times to be overly sentimental (even maudlin to some), I think it is because today most people think of that kind of optimism, itself, as overly sentimental. Raised by parents who experienced the Great Depression and WWII, I can imagine a time when such optimism was not deemed overly sentimental or unbelievable. This film epitomizes that time and those people, and it speaks to my heart and soul. It inspires me and makes me yearn today for such a milieu, in a retrospective way that was not possible for audiences at the time of the film's release. So, for me this movie has grown in stature and improved with age.Russell is one of those actresses who is capable of delivering a performance that evokes laughter and yet tugs at your heartstrings. Carson is not usually seen in roles that offer him the opportunity to portray such nuanced characters. Here he is, and he shines. He was one of the era's great "second bananas." When I see him in a film such as this or Mildred Pierce, I regret that he wasn't given more meaty, starring roles. In this movie Russell is the strength and Carson is the vision - they are a great team, and I enjoyed seeing them grow old together.The ending does come rather abruptly. Yet for those who lived through WWII, there is enough foreshadowing for the rest of the story to be imagined in a general sense. Hardly any family that sent as many sons to the war was blessed to see them all return home. This family had seen plenty of hardship, and would, no doubt, see more. But it would overcome...This doesn't seem overly sentimental to me - just optimistic. 
tt0038038;  Until I happened to catch it on the Turner Classic Movies channel, I'd never heard of Roughly Speaking.  It turns out to be a charming and genuinely funny romantic comedy, set during the Roaring Twenties, the Great Depression, and the 1939-40 New York World's Fair.  Roz Russell and Jack Carson, as a married couple raising a family, keep us wondering what crazy scheme they will cook up next in order to survive hard times.  Their optimism is contagious.  This family laughs a lot, especially when everything is going wrong, and it's real laughter--the kind that makes me laugh along with them.  The ending seemed kind of abrupt, but apart from that, I found this movie great fun and often quite touching.  
tt0038038; Having lived throughout the depression and the Presidency of F D R, I was pleasantly surprised when I happened upon Roughly Speaking on T C M last week. Somehow,in all these years of movie going and viewing,I never had a clue about this moving film.The author expertly weaves into the plot glimpses of those bygone days.. The early airplanes,the the struggle to ride out the lean times. The staid mother's daughter having fought the same crippling disease as had the President,the stock market crash the early war years. Her heart wrenching scene watching all three sons go off to war.Although the movie depicted the triumph over adversity women of the thirties/forties achieved, the young women of today are the daughters and grand daughters of the multi taskers of my mother's dayI wholeheartedly recommend this movie to all American women. Edouarto. 
tt0038038; Rosalind Russell was just right for this movie. Bette was a great actress, but I cannot imagine her as Auntie Mame. Same with the heroin of Roughly Speaking. Russell played it just right, with a touch of laughter and a touch of pathos. It is about a woman who lives through: Divorce, polio, the Depression, one monetary failure after another, and finally seeing her sons off to fight in WWII. However, you see that it makes her family stronger, they learn to fight thru their problems and come out better for it. It is this movie that made me fall in love with Jack Carson. Jack Carson never really made it as a top, top star. In fact in most of his movies he played a buffoon or a jerk. But in Rougly Speaking he plays the kind of man most women wish we were married to. It is my opinion that he pretty much played himself. I recommend it: It comes on TCM regularly, if you have not seen it you are in for a real treat. Watch out for Roughly Speaking you will love it. 
tt0038038;  This was a real surprise.  I found it hard to switch channels once I started watching the movie.  The dialogue was witting and the whole movie charming. The movements between segments of the movie were abrupt but everything else I liked a lot. 
tt0038038; A wonderful Rosalind Russell vehicle with Jack Carson in fine form as her 2nd husband.It tells us of a woman's determination to survive this world-despite deaths in the family, a heel of a husband, (Donald Woods),illness, and the Great Depression.Russell throws her usual zest for this type of commanding woman in the film and succeeds. Though out of his league as the usual grade B actor, Woods succeeds here in the part of the first husband, who walks out on Russell after 10 years of marriage, 4 children and a life of hard times.The film is definitely a slice of Americana and the idea of hard work and accomplishment. It also very well deals with adversity just as things are going so well. Isn't that so true of life itself? That's why the film succeeds and is quite memorable. 
tt0038038; ROUGHLY SPEAKING combines laughter and bathos with good doses of Americana, telling the story of a free-spirited woman (Rosalind Russell) whose positive outlook helps her through hard times after her marriage to stuffy Donald Woods collapses. In a short amount of time, she finds another like spirit in Jack Carson, who has great chemistry with Russell and turns in one of his most heartfelt performances.The story covers a lot of ground so the coverage may seem a bit episodic at times, but in all it's smoothly directed by Michael Curtiz, who gets a good balance of tears, laughter and sentiment from the script. Russell has a tendency to get into her "Auntie Mame" mode at times, but overall her performance is splendid, especially in the final farewell scenes at the train station where she has to see her sons leaving for war service.The good supporting cast includes Robert Arthur, Robert Hutton, Mona Freeman and Andrea King.Although it has several dramatic sequences, the overall feeling is that you've witnessed a "good feeling" kind of movie with a certain kind of nostalgic charm. 
tt0255237; I've been around the horror block a few hundred times. I've literally seen a few thousand horror films from every corner of the world. I actively seek out the sickest films on earth, and had thought myself hopelessly jaded. Now, for the first time in years, I find myself genuinely shocked. Of the thousands of horror films I've seen, Iki-jigoku ranks in the 10 sickest of them all.An excruciating examination of cruelty and insanity, this film makes Make Them Die Slowly look like The Jungle Book. A very cringe inducing mother and daughter team, with amazingly reserved glee, torture a wheelchair bound young man in his own (apparently very well soundproofed) home. With each new scene, I would grind my teeth in dread and anticipation as new and more wretched horrors were visited upon our long suffering (and suffering and suffering) hero.About an hour into the movie, things take a completely insane turn. Humor darker than a cosmic black hole permeates the films decent into total madness.If this were a lousy film (and lets face it, most horror films are), I would have still been pleasantly appalled. However, this movie was actually GREAT! The cinematography was creative without drawing too much attention to itself, the lighting was damned perfect, and the performances were absolutely believable.Those who are not truly horror film junkies will undoubtedly not understand, but if you are among the converted, SEE THIS FILM, even if you have to watch some third generation dub like I did (far be it from Americans to release something this bold).I have just one question: are the Japanese the only people on the face of the earth who can create REAL horror movies anymore? 
tt0255237; Yasu is a depressed wheelchair-bound young man living with his father and siblings. He gets the news that two distant relatives (an old woman who seemingly has Alzheimer's and her 22 year old mute granddaughter) need to move in with them because their immediate family is no longer able to care for them. Upon their arrival, Yasu immediately senses something is wrong with these two strange women. When the rest of the family leaves for work, horrible things start to happen. Is Yasu going crazy or is he stuck in a...drum roll please...living hell?! Filmed in 9 days for around $100,000, "Living Hell" is a perfect example of how great, effective, and well-made a low budget quickie can be if it has the proper talent behind it. The terrific performances range from nuanced to delightfully over-the-top. There is some innovative camera-work, as well as some sequences that are clearly send-ups of more famous directors. This movie has a very gloomy atmosphere, and countless horrifying and disgusting sequences. There are some "jump scares," but the movie does not rely solely upon these. There is also some well-done gore, but (like "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" before it) "less is more" here and it succeeds in being nasty and nauseating.The writing is clever, with a solid dose of black humor thrown in. The story unfolds at a good pace that lets the audience in on some secrets, but keeps you guessing all the way until the twisted finale. There are plot holes galore that some viewers will be unable to overlook. If you can get past these and just go along for the ride this movie and its wildly wonderful performances want so badly to take you on, it will be well worth it.There are a few other flaws, including a synth score that sometimes evokes laughter instead of fear. But overall, this is one of the better horror movies I've seen from the recent wave of Japanese horror cinema. And one of the best minuscule budget horror movies of this decade.The DVD includes 4 short films by the director. The only one I enjoyed was the darkly comedic "Dead Money." There is also a director's commentary that is hit (insisting the movie is more akin to "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?" than "Texas Chainsaw Massacre") or miss (talking about how he filled Rumi's bra with paper, but her breasts were "still not big enough," with no explanation as to why that was necessary for the character's role.) My Rating: 8/10 
tt0255237;  At first, I was a little disappointed by the synth score and what looked to be a low-budget schlocker...but then A LIVING HELL opened up to be a wrenching, well-written horror film that surpasses the landmark TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE on just about every level.When a Japanese family accepts a pair of relatives into their house -- an old woman and her mute, feral daughter -- no one seems to know the pair's murderous past. It would ruin the fun to reveal much beyond this. Let's just say that the film gradually builds its level of intensity with such raw skill that it's almost unnerving. A LIVING HELL leaves nonsense like EVIL DEAD TRAP at the starting gate.This one is well worth seeking out through auction and collector's channels.  
tt0255237;  I had the very special honor to watch this movie at it's first screening at the Fantasy Filmfest in munich this year. I even got me an autograph from the director :) There was indeed a big fuzz about the world premiere, director and producer were in the cinema, as well as many camera teams from japanese TV-stations. Before the screening everyone was excited and, well, a bit wriggled, after it, I looked around and what I saw where shocked faces. The movie really is cruel and filled up with blacker than black humor, but it also shows great photography, a very good story with a wonderful ending and good acting by amateurs including the director as well. Watch this movie, if you like horror movies like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, you won't regret it. 
tt0255237;  I love horror movies. Good ones, bad ones, silly ones - I like them all, except when the only plot device requires the characters to all be total idiots.I picked this up at blockbuster today because I generally find Japan low budget horror films to be better than most. I don't want to tell you readers to skip this one so I'll offer some questions. You can make up your own minds.Q1: You are a journalist who is investigating a missing mental patient and murderer that the police are looking for. You track down the address of her son. If you'd call the police, you might want to pass on this one. If you'd drive over at night (when you know he's home), sneak in a bathroom window and start wandering around, this movie could be for you.Q2: You come home and find your brother beaten, bleeding and frightened. Power is out, phones are dead and you know that two evil people are still in the house. Brother says "Go out the window and get help". If you'd get help, skip this. If you think wandering though the house looking for your cell phone is a better idea, have at it. Q3: You find your cell phone. Dial 911? Not for you. Nope, watch this movie if you think the best action is to now get a flashlight and start looking for that lost first aid kit. There's a lot more stupid stuff. Watch this film only if you can totally and I mean totally turn off your brain. You won't find a bigger collection of morons until you get to a slapstick comedy.  
tt0255237; I have to say I was kinda disappointed in LIVING HELL. I had initially read some reviews in Rue Morgue magazine, and I had high hopes for this film due to the fact that their reviews usually match how I feel about a film pretty closely. I read how "disturbing" and "graphic" this film was, so naturally I was ready for an all-out bloodbath. Unfortunately, LIVING HELL didn't provide on that front. I do have to say that the first half or so of the film was entertaining and had some cool concepts and visuals. The idea of the kid in the wheelchair being unable to defend himself from the two psychos that are torturing him, and also being unable to make anyone else believe him, did amp up the tension factor. But after awhile the story started wearing thin and by the end I think I just didn't really care anymore. All-in-all, not a bad low-budget effort. There is some gore and shocks, just not enough for my taste. 7/10 
tt0255237;  What a huge disappointment this film turned out to be! It's just frustrating to watch as writer/director Shugo Fujii fails to capitalize on all the promise his film help up to the last third. There was something really disturbing about the torture and cruelty in this movie that instantly won me over. The evil old woman and the corpse-like teenaged girl who invade a seemingly normal household are quite freaky and used cleverly and effectively. There's a subplot about a newspaper reporter getting on the trail of the two madwomen that injects a lot of tension into the narrative. But one downright silly climax (that is filled with annoying overacting and megalomaniacal laughter) and about ten unnecessary twists (which make both Shyamalan's antics and the ending of Haute Tension look coherent in comparison) later only a distant memory of the above mentioned virtues remains. A Living Hell could and should have been a modern horror film classic but instead it turned into a disappointing mess.  
tt0255237; So this movie loves to see itself as a blend of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and movies from the Hammer studios, which is an interesting approach to take for a Japanese genre movie but not really one that works out all too successful.Thing about this movie is that it just isn't being much good as a horror. For most part of the movie, there is no good tension or mystery in it and when it does feature elements such as that, it doesn't quite work out that well, since the movie just isn't the best made or most convincing one. In the first half of the movie you'll basically have no idea what is going on and during the second half, when everything gets explained and revealed, you simply don't care enough anymore.It's really a problem that the story just isn't being all that good. Besides, it's hard to follow and messy at times and the story doesn't always makes the best choices. Of course basically all Japanese horror movies have a certain 'weirdness' to them but this movie really pushes it at times and unfortunately goes a bit overboard with it as well at certain points, especially toward its ending, which also doesn't really rhymes with the movie its first half.Another thing I also disliked about the movie was that it didn't really featured a good and likable enough main character in it. What, just because the main character is in a wheelchair we are supposed to sympathize for him? No, he just doesn't have enough character to him and it doesn't help that he's being mostly mute throughout the entire movie.The movie is mostly being torture-porn and this is also where most of the movie its horror comes from. If you're looking for gore, this movie still has some moments in it but it isn't the best, since most of it is very random and doesn't really work out as anything shocking or graphic, also mainly because it isn't always being handled that well, or incorporated into the story convincingly. The movie is mostly taking a 'fun' and entertainment type of approach, as opposed to a serious and atmospheric horror kind of approach, which wasn't one of the best choices this movie made, since it pretty much ruins all of the horror aspects about it.You could say that the movie perhaps tried a bit too hard. Director Shugo Fujii was only 26, at the time he did this movie, so perhaps he let his youthful enthusiasms take over, which blinded him and prevented him from making a truly good and successful genre movie. Or perhaps it was simply being a lack of experience thing. After all, it was only his first full length movie.I just couldn't ever really like or get into this movie.4/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ 
tt0255237; I was lucky enough to come across a copy of "Living Hell" in a record shop, used. I scooped it, not really knowing what to expect, but it looked cool on the cover. I laughed at the goofy tags on the insert...It claimed to be 'a Japanese chainsaw massacre..' Truth be told, I think this movie is almost as good as "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre." The story is like this: a family of four with a handicapped, wheelchair-bound son, takes in some relatives that have been sort of abandoned. An old lady and a mysterious, ultra-creepy, animal-girl. Things take a turn for the worse and we find that the seemingly innocent old lady is not so innocent, and the animal girl, she's, well...an animal. I won't give anything else away, but I'll say this: I usually don't get creeped out by movies and I've seen my share: "Cannibal Holocaust," "Beyond the Darkness," etc... This one creeped me out. I got a little nervous when "Living Hell" takes a turn for the dark side.I'd highly recommend this one to people who love Asian horror or gore films. If you can find it...8 out of 10, kids. 
tt0255237; Living Hell (2000) ** (out of 4) Yasu (Hurorito Honda) is a troubled twenty-two year old who is confined to a wheelchair due to some sort of anxiety, which has taken over his body. The young man lives with his father, sister and brother but soon two new relatives show up at the house. Chiyo, a senile older woman and her granddaughter strike the young boy as being a bit weird but soon he realizes that they are a lot more than that. Within days of moving in the two women start torturing the boy but no one in the family will believe him because they think this is just an act to get more attention. With no one to believe him Yasu is trapped in the house with the women who go all out to serve their deadly plans.I went into Living Hell with high expectations but in the end I found myself checking my clock way too much to totally enjoy the film. There are many wonderful ideas floating around in the film but in the end we're left with a pretty empty film without any characters to root for and an ending that's so over the top and ripped from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre that the eeriness the director tries for went way over my head.The first thirty minutes really kills the film with its boring introduction to the new family, which will soon be stalked by the crazy grandmother and granddaughter. We first see the family gathered around the breakfast table arguing about the new guests that are about to arrive. All this fighting is so incredibly annoying that within minutes you'll be wishing they'd get knocked off right then and there. Also in this time we never really get to know any of the family members, especially the paralyzed boy who is supposed to be the guy we're rooting for throughout the film. What we do get to see of him doesn't make us care too much for him and the wooden performance by Hirohito Honda doesn't help mattes either.Without anyone to care for I really had a hard time getting into the actual torturing that goes on. I'm quite certain the director wants us to cheer for our young hero yet since he never bothered to let us get to know him then we're left without any real emotions going throughout the film. Another incredibly boring and pointless plot line has a local detective trying to track down the grandmother but this here turns out to be nothing more than filler, which adds an extras thirty-minutes to the running time and doesn't offer us anything interesting. Even without a likable character I was hoping the violence would push this into the entertainment level but that didn't happen either.I think the film tries to appear a lot meaner than it actually is. Perhaps I'm just a little too jaded but the violence here wasn't really anything we haven't seen before and if you've seen any horror films from Italy then I highly doubt you'll be shocked by this film. In the torture department we see teeth being pulled out, heads beaten with hammers, the young boy used as a dart board and to top it all off we even get to see his private area soaked with water only to have a stun gun put to test. None of this is done overly graphic and the director makes a mistake by keeping the film a bit too clean. With such films like Organ and Men Behind the Sun I'm really not sure what the point of this cleanness was. Perhaps budget problems? Director Shugo Fujii adds some nice touches here and there but the bad editing and constant blackouts really start to get annoying very quickly. The director does a wonderful job trying to set up a doomed atmosphere, which is nicely brought to life by the way the film is lit. Most of the scenes take place with light only coming through windows while other scenes are merely lit by candles. Another nice addition are some wickedly creepy sound effects that come into play throughout the movie. Living Hell is worth a viewing but I can't help but feel it should have been a lot better. 
tt0290867;  "La Spagnola" (literally "The Spanish Woman", in Italian) is a searingly sexy black comedy from "down-under" that explores the dysfunctional relationship between the fiery and beautiful Spaniard, Lola (Lola Marceli in a star-making performance) and her sensitive and lonely daughter, Lucia (the beguiling newcomer Alice Ansara). There is not a false note in the entire film. Under Steve Jacobs' assured direction, the faultless performances, stunning cinematography, playful musical score and songs, work their surprising and indelible magic upon us.Anna-Maria Monticelli's achingly funny yet deceptively simple narrative rings with harsh truths about the migrant experience in 60s Australia, and propels this sublime human drama towards a touching conclusion. "La Spagnola" is firecracker of a film and a sure-fire bet for the next "Best Foreign Film" Oscar.
tt0290867;  What was up the previous reviewers butt, I dont know? Pure hate if you ask me. I mean, how could anyone destroy such a delightful and interestingly shot film so thoroughly as to make this reader doubt it was the same film at all?This film was refreshing, happy, sad, completely entertaining if you want to see things done freshly with a camera and acting that takes you away into the movie itself. Reaching deep emotions quickly and coming up for air just as fast for the next scene, many times throughout, this cast held me in awe.I reccomend this film to anyone who simply enjoys film. Period.And if youre from some difficult childhood issues, you might even relate to the subject matter.Oh, and take any uncomfortable objects out of your bum before viewing, please, or you'll end up sounding like that other reviewer, no matter the film. 
tt0290867; This delightful Australian film came out of nowhere, as I doubt it was ever was shown commercially in this country, except maybe in some markets, but never in the N.Y. area, as far as I'm concerned. It is a film that holds one's attention because of what Steve Jacobs, its director, working on a screen play by Anna Maria Monticelli, has achieved. He deserves better than the obscurity this film seems to have gained. Had it not been for HBO Latino, we would have missed this funny Australian movie.Perhaps most viewers get confused with this movie trying to be a lot of different styles, not settling into being just a comedy, or a black one, at that. There are lots of situations in the film that immigrants all over the world could easily identify with. There is a 'melange' of languages enough to confuse the most brilliant linguists, but in a funny kind of way. It's easy to follow what one sees on the screen.The two principal actresses, Lola Marceli, and Alice Ansara, make this film enjoyable. Both women bring a fire to whatever they do in line with what one's expectations. Lola Marceli is a gorgeous creature who smolders the screen with the heat she projects. Ms. Ansara, as the long suffering daughter, is quite good herself. The best thing in the film is Aunt Manola's version of the ritual of preparing the cucumber salad. Lourdes Bartolome is nothing less than genial as her facial expressions are seen in close ups. Not only that, but Aunt Manola adheres to the most hygienic ways of preparing food!Watch this movie with an open mind and it will reward the viewer. 
tt0290867;  There's a lot of negative reviews about this film on this site, but in fact I found it to be quite quirky, funny and engrossing. If you get a chance to see it, do so - you'll be pleasantly surprised by this funny, fiery dysfuctional Austalian film (also good if you're studying Spanish or Italian) 
tt0290867; While the DB reviewers all seem to be unsure of what to make of this film, it does indeed have a growing tradition in style with other Australian quirky movies such as Strictly Ballroom, Priscilla, and the Baz Luhrmann Red Curtain series. The staging, cinematography, execution and editing of shots are quick, colourful and energetically paced.This allows the bizarre story to unfold, and the characters to develop, with explanations for their motivations being revealed gradually. The genius lies in Anna Maria Monticelli's beautiful script which intelligently begins to unravel events that have already occurred without explanation, all in a comfortable linear format. Such imaginative exposition is rarely given without confusing flashbacks, and is the heart of this film. I found the structure elegantly clarified all of the initially obscure scenes.The mother Lola never becomes sympathetic, however Lola Marceli's sterling debut convinces the viewer of a person becoming truly disturbed by her transplanted identity as Spanish woman amongst Italians, in an uncaring Australian society, deserted by her husband and scorned by her neglected daughter. Alice Ansara's Lucia cool-as-a-cucumber performance is understated and believable, and all the more commendable for her excellent language skills which define her character, and serve as some of the funniest bits of business as she gently toys with her clients' own lack of linguistics.And of course Alex Dimitriades yet again demonstrates his smouldering leading man persona which we first saw in 1998's masterful "Head On".Lourdes BartolomA©'s turn as catty sister Manola chews the lush scenery and deftly steals the show, particularly in the dancing and cooking sequence! I might point out that she is most entranced by a courgette (zucchini), rather than a cucumber, as one reviewer has written... 
tt0290867; There are several things about this film so clunky and amateurish that they make me cringe. But it kept me glued to the screen anyway. The plot's not the problem: its disjointed nature seemed quite lifelike and realistic. It was very dark, and it surprises me that other commentators can call it comedic and enchanting. It certainly had comedic moments and enchanting moments but I found it pretty wrenching watching a 14-year-old begging her father not to abandon her to her mother, not to mention watching said mother have sex just to try to get money for the rent. But I was moved by those scenes. I was also intrigued by the scenario of the beautiful sister who doesn't have any fun in bed and her plain sister who knows how to enjoy herself. That's not what usually happens in the movies. What bothered me was the following: 1. All the anglo-Australian parts were caricatures of evil (except for one neutral, non-evil shop assistant). Yes, I know that's how Arabs, Germans and South Africans are portrayed in Hollywood films, but I expected more subtlety from this film. 3. Lucia spoke Spanish with a strong Australian accent, and I'm pretty sure you don't do that when your parents are native Spanish speakers. Well, you would if they never spoke Spanish to you, but Lola speaks almost exclusively in Spanish. I don't know quite how I expected the actress (Alice?) to overcome the problem, but it was a problem. 2. Lola looks like a 24-year-old movie star in every single shot, even when her daughter comes back to visit her. While I loved watching her for her sheer gorgeousness, it was hard, despite her acting talent, to believe in her as the mother of a 14-year-old, suffering poverty and stress. All that artfully shot dust never seemed to touch her or her beautiful clothes. Maybe her unchanging beauty was meant to be some sort of statement about how her daughter saw her, but I suspect it was really down to overzealous stylists or the director having a crush on her. Well, it wasn't perfect. I don't even know if I'd say it was good. But it was different, and that's something you don't see very often. 
tt0290867;  LucA­a is a 14-year-old girl living in Australia with her beautiful Spanish mother, Lola (the title refers to her and means "Spanish woman"), while her Italian father (named Ricardo) has run off with an Australian woman. Lola is a woman of fiery emotions, which she demonstrates very quickly by throwing herself on top of and then in front of the car as Ricardo attempts to drive off. She wants him back, or at least for him to pay her bills, and failing that she wants revenge. LucA­a would just like a normal family and to spend time with the family chickens and the goat named Elvis.That barely gives a hint of the flavor of the film, which is *very* quirky, often darkly humorous, and sometimes dramatic. I enjoyed individual bits (Lourdes BartolomA© steals the scenes she's in as LucA­a's aunt Manola), but on the whole it didn't really work for me. Still, there's enough here to give it a mild recommendation.This was Australia's nomination for the best foreign language film of 2001, which is an interesting concept in that Australia is an English speaking country, but this is in fact a foreign language film. It is currently playing in Europe, but the director (who was at the San Francisco International Film Festival screening where I saw it on 5/1/2002 to introduce it but not for questions) does not expect it to get distribution in the U.S. 
tt0290867; The life story of a bitter woman that's despised by his husband and her continuous fight with her only daughter... Though the plot may look like a drama "La Spagnola" is actually a comedy with traces of tragedy. It's rather rude and hysterical and with a coarse sense of humor (just like Almodovar in his early works, but without the transgression of the Spanish director). It has also plenty of topics about Latin women (they're loud, passionate, etc., etc.).As for the actress that plays the main role, Lola Marceli, it is funny 'cause in Spain he had never taken part on a movie. She had just played some minor roles in soap-operas and stuff, and suddenly they offer her a part in this Australian production. Well, I think he did a nice job, too bad it made no difference for his career, she's still making TV series... How come?? Well, I don't know. There you got actresses like Elena Anaya or Paz Vega that are just dreadful and still they participate in lots of movies. OK, they're younger than Marceli, but definitely they're not more beautiful than her and, above all, they're not as good actresses as she is. Spain is different.*My rate: 6/10 
tt0290867;  The plot is tenuous, the action is repetitive, the cinematography is gawky industrial, the obsession with cars is cute, the multiple languages is interesting, the performances are adequate, the overall effect is "if you are tired watching Hollywood stuff you may want to check it out but then maybe not, just curl up in bed with a good book".And if you are male, you may want to see it just for the blatant pleasure of ogling Lola Marceli in glorious 35 mm color. 
tt0290867;  La Spagnola had a lot of potential but didn't live up to expectations. The plot just was not strong enough. Despite fine acting this was a missed opportunity. It has its heart in the right place but  not a lot really happens. Alice Ansara is a real find and is a young actor we will here a lot more from in the future.
tt0429482; Before expressing my opinion, I must say that (while I have no personal involvement in the film project) being a school teacher, who's gay, and who grew up and lives in the area in which this film is set - I strongly identify with it."50 Ways of Saying Fabulous" has a strong ring of authenticity to it. This may not translate well to the world outside Central Otago, New Zealand - but for a local there's a lot to recognise. A 'coming of age' film it is, but it is also a lot more. It's a brave telling of the true childhood stories that we tend not to allow to see the light of adulthood. The actors achieve the perfect balance between the paradoxical naivety and knowingness characteristic of the early teenage years. They inspired me with the bravery of their (sometimes misguided) idealism and the story leads them to expose, through their inevitable frustrations, a lot of the senselessness of the restrictions of our narrow society. I loved the relative absence of developed adult roles. The children were not only the main protagonists, but with the unwavering focus on their story: their view became ours - no translation required. Those who would criticise the 'cheesy low budget space-show' scenes woven throughout the film must surely have forgotten the fantasies of their own childhood, or perhaps they never needed to resort to fantasy to escape an all-too-restrictive daily reality. These sequences really were very funny in all of their overt symbolism.The bravery and incredible sincerity of the outcast character "Roy" (played with unwavering emotional and physical conviction by Jay Collins) struck a chord with me. The tragedy of his determination was almost too much to bear.I found the shifting of accent for the character "Jamie" (played by Michael Dorman) a little jarring. Somehow "South Auckland Polynesian, circa 2005" segued into "Aussie Battler" a few too many times for me to suspend disbelief.The filming, in the stunning wilds of Central Otago, captured the vast emptiness of the place beautifully. The characters owned the terrain, there was nothing else there. The intense colour saturation reinforced the historical nature of the film (It was set in the 70's). The drought, and the constant threat of fire, added beautifully to the undertone of tension. Something might go wrong.Stories like this need to be told over and over in all their variety and colour. I loved sitting in our local cinema surrounded by teenagers from the school at which I teach and seeing them enjoying and responding to the message to "be themselves". New Zealand is perhaps coming of age too, to see a feature film of this nature to fruition.Anyone with a curiosity for the culture of this isolated southern island would do well to catch this film. It adds a new chapter to the story of where we come from as told in the likes of "The Piano", "Heavenly Creatures" and "Once Were Warriors". Fabulous. 
tt0429482; Not as true to the book as it could have been. Some of the more feminine moments in the book ended up on the cutting room floor. However congratulations to the young male actors for very brave performances. The golden colours appear too contrived at times and this was unnecessary because the landscape is awe inspiring anyway.At screenings in Wanaka this last week I am told the audience is clapping at the conclusion of each screening. Well done to all involved particularly given the budget the film enjoyed.This is another example of a New Zealand film that takes a universal theme (the complexities and confusions of adolescence and early sexual awareness)and puts it into a very traditional rural context and reminds us of the normality of it all. 
tt0429482; The movie tackles a sensitive subject in a way that is accessible to a wide audience. The plot moves at a brisk pace, and the acting is always excellent, especially by the three lead child actors. Dialogue is true to life, and sometimes very funny. I found several of the scenes very moving, especially those where the characters try to come to terms with the complexity of their adolescent emotions. The story concentrates on the children's viewpoint, with adults mostly absent - this is a good idea as puts the focus onto the relationships of the adolescents, which are the most dramatic. The period art direction is faultless, the landscape settings are awesome, and the music adds a nice comic touch. This is a very entertaining film that also carries an important and heartfelt message - that we are all basically the same and need to show each other tolerance and understanding. That's an important message in this day and age. 
tt0429482; What an enjoyable watch with a real sense of rural New Zealand in the 70's. There were some wonderful performances from the children & the audience embraced the gentle humour & story, especially it seemed, an older generation. It connected with an audience who either knew these characters or anyone who had grappled with the complications, the lows, the trivia & the joys of growing up. The landscape of Central Otago looked stunning & was transformed into an amazing moonscape in the day-for-night scenes - loved that moody twilight world.The 'look' actually reminded me a lot of the genius & madness of Canadian Director Guy Madden's films. The 'zany' quality w/ camera zooms, fantasy sequences & OTT music worked fabulously together, but it's a rare beast that also has a sensitive, good looking and well told story - all bundled into one fab package. Well done I say!! 
tt0429482; Based on the novel of the same name by Graeme Aitken, and directed by Stewart Main, 50 WAYS OF SAYING FABULOUS is a coming-of-age story set in rural New Zealand in 1979.Its protagonist is Billy (Andrew Patterson), an overweight and overly-imaginative 12 year old boy main whose passion in life is watching science fiction adventures and reenacting them with his tomboy cousin Lou (Harriet Beatie).Lou loves rugby, Billy hates the game, a fact which confirms his status as an object of derision among the other local kids. The arrival of the even more awkward Roy (a gangly Jay Collins) at their small regional school changes the pecking order, and provides even Billy with someone that he can bully and belittle. Despite the tension between them, the two boys also embark on early sexual explorations together down by the creek, although neither of them know what a 'poofter' is, and accept the taunts of their peers to that effect in pained innocence.Complicating matters is another new arrival, Jamie (the charismatic Michael Dorman), a handsome young farmhand working for Billy's father, whose presence becomes the catalyst for tensions that disrupt the shared lives of these three almost-teens.While 50 WAYS OF SAYING FABULOUS does have merit in its honest exploration of the sexual awakening of a young gay boy on the verge of adolescence, and is occasionally warm and affecting, its narrative is episodic, and its dramatic structure is often contrived. Too, the plodding, unimaginative direction fails to imbue the story with any real tension, although several scenes, especially those shot at night, looked superb, with evocative lighting and composition.Had its running time been cut back to 45 minutes to an hour, this would have been a stronger film. As it was, its 90 minute duration definitely outstays its welcome. 
tt0429482; The story of my life as a young overweight gay boy growing up in a small town 35 years ago. What a darling little boy. I also noticed how very true it was that the young man knew what he wanted. His eyes were bleeding to see what he wanted to see! And, yet, his girlfriend, who was not all too happy about being a girl, had no concept of attraction to anyone. She just knew she wanted to play sports and it was her job to take up for the "puffits" of the world. My favorite line was near the end when he said he "belonged here." That sense of belonging is what brings us all together.Sweet movie. Lynn 
tt0429482; Stewart Main's production is a coming-of-age story that bears little resemblance to other typical and predictable movies. 12 year-old Billy idly watches a TV show with his best friend, a rather tomboyish girl who excels at boys sports and acts a bit manly. Inspired by what he sees on TV, Billy wears a fake ponytail and pretends to be Lana, the heroine of the sci-fi series while Lou, the girl, poses as the male hero. They subvert traditional gender affiliated roles as part of a game, but they are also aware of a certain otherness, a certain counterpart that can exist only in private.The figure of the double, largely described in fantastic literature, is usually developed when the main character fails to recognize his own-self, and starts experiencing a feeling of alienation. The double can adopt several forms, as for instance the form of the exact replica of the character, like in Dostoyevsky's "The double", or on the contrary, it can become the form of an absence of reflection in the mirror image, a horrifying 'presence' as in Maupassant's "Le Horla". Clearly Billy and his friend Lou find an ideal refugee in the form of fictional characters that supply that which they are lacking, Billy is a boy that wishes to be a girl, and Lou is a girl that wishes to be a boy.In this scenario, two other characters will help develop the dynamic of the double. First of all is Roy, the new kid in the school, who soon becomes attracted to Billy. A most revealing moment takes place when Roy is picked on by kids that held him to the ground, as a consequence of all this roughhousing, the young boy exhibits an erection that soon makes the other lads lose interest in him. This moment is defined by the emergence of sexual excitation in Roy's penis, an irruption of the drive of the real in his body, such pulsations also exist in Billy who stays behind and accepts Roy's invitation to touch his "stiffy".Do they experiment joy only through phallic exploration? The phallus has no image, the absence of representation in the visual field "signifies that in everything that is imaginary localization, the phallus appears in the form of a lack". As the days go by, Billy is not acquitted of guilt, but nonetheless he decides to join his friend Roy in a shack, wherein they mutually masturbate. But why does Billy seem uncomfortable after these sessions? Perhaps because if the phallus 'is characterized by a lack', then any image would only 'mask' that lack, evoking something which is absent, and in principle one can define that absence as something that pertains to our bodily existence in so far as what is missing in the virtual image is our real existence itself. In the same way Billy can never truly be Lana, from the TV show, he cannot envision his acts with Roy except in the darkness and secrecy of the shack. But what part of our anatomy permits the distinction between oneself and one's own image, including the multitude of others with whom we tend to identify? It is this distinction that seems to get distorted and somewhat effaced in the phenomenon of the double.The second important character in the story is Jamie, a guy in his twenties. As soon as he enters into the scene, Billy seems to forget all about Roy. He now starts daydreaming about this guy, this strange adult that could eventually pay some attention to him. But before Billy can get closer to Jamie, he must first decide if he should adopt the male or the female position, which is basically the same decision Lou has to make. As the relationship with Roy deteriorates, new problems will arise. The double, again, could signal the coming of ominous events. 
tt0429482; Despite reviews referring to 50 Ways as "charming" the movie is hardly a pleasant coming of age film. If you're looking for something sunny and lighthearted to watch look elsewhere. Though 50 Ways is quite sunny in its setting, New Zealand during a drought, there is a mean tone throughout the film as the cruelty of children and families is accurately portrayed over and over and over again. (So much so that when the films main bully, a standard stock character adolescent bastard, plunges over a bridge to the rocks below it feels like a bright spot in the film.)The scenery is nice, the acting is good. The music is horrible and plentiful, meandering flute tunes that seem as if they're meant to hammer home the notion of how charming it all is.50 Ways is pretty boring, nothing much happens except children being mean to anyone different than them and some moments of melodrama which seem thrown in just to make the film more exciting. There are also some fantasy sequences which are so irregular in their appearance that they seem as if they somehow bled over from an entirely different film. 
tt0429482; This coming-out story of 12-year-old Billy is set in rural New Zealand in 1975. Actually, it's more of a Bildungsroman, because it's no secret to anyone that Billy is gay. His family and friends accept him for who he is, but he's having problems at school.We follow Billy as he shows us his home, family and childhood friends (mainly tomboy Lou) and his school life, where he is bullied and struggling with his dislike of rugby.We follow him as he experiences his first relationship with fellow "pufter" Roy and his first crush on older and completely unobtainable Jamie (played by a sexy young Michael Dorman)."50 Ways" has an incredibly strong sense of time and place. I can't remember any movie that so successfully reconstructs the 1970s. The clothes, the haircuts, the town scenes, the homes -- it was all spot on. There was even a fondue dinner. Am I imagining it, but did the cinematography somehow reproduce the quality and texture of photographs from the 1970s? Movie goers are also treated to almost two hours of beautiful New Zealand landscape.Main seems to have directed this movie using a group of rural New Zealand children. The line between fiction and documentary is a thin one. The child actors in this movie appeared only in this movie and almost nowhere else. How often do you see real children acting out a graphic gay coming-of-age movie? How did Main accomplish this? I think this would have been unthinkable in puritan America, wouldn't it? For this reason alone, the film is remarkable.The realism is astonishing. This is not a phony after-school special school. These are not American movie children. These are children without guile and sophistication, without internet, without MTV. Main shows us children and school life as they really were, with all its complexities, difficulties and awkwardness. Sure, the acting was occasionally amateurish, or the dialogue a little forced, but for the most part I felt like I was watching a real group of New Zealand children ca. 1975.Andrew Paterson, Harriet Beattie and Jay Collins -- I'd like you to thank you for playing in this movie. You did a great job. Your characters will remain with me for a long time.I found the film to be moving, engrossing, relevant. I thought the movie had good character development and a few interesting plot twists. The complex and problematic relationship between soft Billy and tough Lou was the core of the movie. We outgrow our childhood friends as we discover ourselves.Main doesn't sugar coat what it's like to grow up gay. It's a rich and full look at every aspect. Billy's hopeless and awkward crush on Jamie felt true. I felt really sorry for hapless Roy. Billy's difficulties with Roy and Jamie reflect core relationship issues that reverberate throughout every gay man's life. The struggle with "rugby" (and what that represents) is also familiar. Adults play a very minor role in this movie. Isn't that also accurate for gay teenagers? What I particularly liked was the way that Main explored how we come to terms with those dreaded words ("pufter", "faggot", "queer", or whatever). "What does that really mean?" And "Yes, that is what I am." Dealing with those words is a big part of growing up.At times the director introduces some whimsy, mostly based on the theme of Billy's imagined fantasies of a television show similar to Lost in Space. Billy identifies with Lana, Lou identifies with Brad. It's difficult to know what to make of such a deliberate and in-your-face use of cheese in a movie like this. I have to confess I was also into these shows when I was a kid. Or perhaps I have a high threshold for cheese. I think it's accurate to make a television show the centre of a boy's imagination in the 1970s.I see the movie has not got a strong score on IMDb. However, I wouldn't let this dissuade you from seeing it. Gay movies tend to get inexplicably and undeservedly low scores. Worth seeing! 
tt0429482; '50 Ways of Saying Fabulous' is an absolute gem of a film. I was so thoroughly delighted to come across it inadvertently, thanks to the continuously dedicated efforts of Wolfe Video. Perhaps as an Aussie growing up during the same period and now having lived abroad for 19 years I found it particularly refreshing and nostalgic. My only wish is that this film had been helped to find a wider audience, as I'm convinced that it would have become a cult classic. I was disappointed in the sensationalised trailer which I only watched after having seen the film, as I wanted to post it on face book and encourage all of my friends to see the film. This movie should be seen by both queer and straight audiences alike, as it's themes are universal. Sadly, I could not bring myself to 'post' the trailer (which was not remotely representative of the film) as it would have put a lot of people off. Please re-release this pearla of a movie in order that it can have a new and on-going life in the canon of superb cinema. Simone L. Petersen

tt0056537;  I've seen this film recently at the Ritwik Ghatak retrospective in the Vienna Filmmuseum in February 2002. I only can say: a masterpiece. A real discovery.After having seen this extraordinary film, I can't understand why Ghatak's genius was hardly appreciated in his lifetime, why it had to take so long to rediscover him as one of the most amazing film directors of the 20th century.The beautiful and heart-wrenching story tells about a family of Hindu refugees from East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) who struggle to find a new home in West Bengal. Ishwar Chakravorty gets a job near the river Subarnarekha and goes there with his little sister Shita and Abhiram, a low-caste young boy from the refugee camp he has adopted after the boy's mother had been abducted. They hope to find happiness in this new environment, but when Abhiram comes home after his school years and wants to marry Shita (who is also in love with him), tragic conflicts emerge that shatter the lives of all main characters.The impressive direction with unorthodox usage of sound and music and expressionistic camera angles, the beautiful photography (notably in Ishwar's "breakdown scene"), and the great performances especially by the amazing Abhi Bhattacharya and Madhabi Mukherjee (though there is also some rather bad acting by some supporting actors, but this is only a minor drawback to the film) all add to the great impression of this wonderful picture. An absolute must-see! 
tt0056537; I've seen two of Ghatak's films, this and "Cloud-Capped Star". Ghatak creates a distinct and poignant mood of tragedy that is not entirely without redemption or promise. He also puts music to powerful effect, here the lead (Sita) sings so beautifully and sadly it will break your heart. The film has elements of a fairy tale - - I am thinking particularly of the way in which fateful forces separate and then reunite the long-lost characters. Ghatak handles the story in such a way that such elements feel entirely natural.I cannot figure out why Ghatak is relatively unknown in the United States. He's at least as good as Ray. Both, though, are underrepresented, and their films are pitifully hard to find.I thought this was one of the best films I've seen. 
tt0056537; It's criminal that this masterpiece isn't better known. Ritwik Ghatak is a fascinating director, haunted by the trauma of the Partition, the arbitrary line the British drew across northern India to mark the border with Pakistan. He is a far more political and provocative artist than Satyajit Ray. Subarna Rekha Â<U+0096> Golden River Â<U+0096> is an angry, tragic film about displaced Bengali refugees. Ishwar Chakraborty IAbhi Bhattacharya) is a middle class educated man who leaps at the first chance to get out of the colony when an old friend offers him a post in a provincial factory. This will afford him the security to bring up his younger sister and an orphan boy for whom feels responsible. Years pass, and the boy Â<U+0096> now an aspiring writer Â<U+0096> and girl fall in love. Their older brother is horrified. The boy is lower caste, and this will undo his professional standing. No spoilers here, but the last act of this almost Shakespearean drama is absolutely unforgettable, and if you get the chance to see it, grab it. I was reminded of Shakespearean tragedy, but also of nineteenth century novels by Balzac and Dostoievsky. Yet the film-making is expressionist and remarkably modernÂ  the way that Ghatak amplifies and distorts sound, the way he exploits and subverts the conventions of song in popular Indian cinema, and his bold but sparing use of point of view shots and close upsÂ  I am not in the habit of awarding perfect tens, but this is one of the greatest films I have ever seen. 
tt0056537; I watched this film at my college days.I saw it twice.But still I have not lost my appetite to watch it again.This film features post-independent state of Bengal.This film contradicted many old ideas like 'Nachiketa','Upanishad' and pioneered a new era after partition of Bengal.The river Subarnarekha and a beautiful home (surrounded by birds,music) on the bank of the river symbolizes the happiness,joy of the homeless people who has come from the East Pakistan.The director shows here that continuous rioting,communality,partition have killed Bengali classic culture,pride etc.The background music applied is just awesome by Ustad Bahadur Khan and good singing by Arati Mukherjee.The application and implication of the Rabindra song "Aj Dhaner Khete" implies the director's great sense.No doubt it should be taken as one of the best movies ever made in India.This great work by Ritwik Ghatak should get many awards but got nothing.I think this was the next master work after 'Meghe Dhaka Tara' by Ritwik Ghatak. 
tt0056537; "Subarnarekha" means "Streak of Gold". Even for a layman like me this critically acclaimed film had brought along a golden treasure, in a sense that it makes a mind think about the duality of fiction and fact, of dream and void, and of course of the dilemma about truth and beauty in life. The film showcases outstanding acting performances,featuring some of the most brilliant actors/actresses(Abhi Bhattyacharya,Bijan Bhattacharya,Madhabi Mukhopadhyay)of our age. To me the greatest moment of this film appears when at the riverbank (subarnarekha) Sita's little son eventually asks his uncle Iswar the same questions which his mother had asked years ago when Iswar along with little Sita, had first come to Subarnarekha to settle for a job. The questions,wrapped with childish imaginations, were about their "new home", Iswar,who did not believe in telling fictions("lies" to Iswar) to amuse a child, when confronted with the same questions from Sita's son,stares at him, remaining baffled and speechless. He loses himself in a trans,perhaps in search of an answer, and finally protects the child's fantasies by giving an affirmative answer this time. 
tt0056537; Ritwik Ghatak's Subarnarekha is a tale of a refugee family in the aftermath of the partition of Bengal. Subarnarekha tracks the lives of a man, his child sister and a young boy whom the man provided shelter after the boy loses his mother in a mAalA©e.The film begins in a refugee camp of the then Calcutta, where a number of refugees have gathered in the hope of building their homes anew. We witness how the pangs of poverty and homelessness metamorphoses an individual's attitude towards life and his decisions throughout his life. Subarnarekha is a tale of hopelessness at most times. Ritwik Ghatak portrays the plight of the three characters, their hardships and its ensuing effects on their thoughts, actions and the very paths they tread in their lives. The mood is often one of darkness and despair as Ritwik chooses not to offer any artificial sugary balm for the viewer in his tale of stark, heartrending reality.As is Ritwik Ghatak's trademark, Subarnarekha is a film of tremendous strength, that bombards the mind and stings the senses, leaving behind a gash in its wake. 
tt0037849;  This film was a wonderful tribute to Paulette Goddard's looks and abilities. At the top of her career, she proves that she is one of Hollywood's most glamorous enduring stars.  In this film she plays a guttersnipe that is chosen by Gainsborough (played wonderfully by Cecil Kellaway) to have her portrait painted in typical Gainsborough fashion.  As she poses for him two handsome dandies stop by for a visit, only to be bewitched by her beauty, thinking she is of noble birth, much to Kellaway's amusement.  Upon learning the truth, Ray Milland, trains Kitty to head for bigger prey, hoping to make himself rich, as he is living way over his means.  Of course, she falls in love with him. Along the way to fame, Kitty becomes a Duchess and goes her own way to success, even though she still loves Milland.   In the end, love wins out.  A wonderful performance is also given by Constance Collier as Milland's drunken lady friend in conspiracy.  The scene when she is introduced to the waif Goddard and is reposing, drunk in her bed, is hysterical.  5 stars to this one.  Goddard never looked lovelier.  In fact,I have an original color poster from the film.  A vintage collection I am quite proud of. 
tt0037849; Paulette Goddard deserves to have this movie seen and enjoyed, and so do we. She was a charming actress, and this film gave her a chance to show it. Ray Milland is also a very charming cad. It's been too long since I've seen it, on TV when I was much younger, but I remember how much I liked it. For years I think I had it confused with FOREVER AMBER, but I was able to get ahold of that film on VHS a couple of years ago, and was greatly disappointed--I thought it sure wasn't as good as I remembered. It wasn't until I happened upon KITTY while looking at films done by Paulette, whom I also loved in REAP THE WILD WIND, that I realized I was disappointed by AMBER because it was not KITTY. Well, so it goes. Come on, whoever owns the Paramount vault, dig into it. And look at other Mitchell Leisen films too, like HOLD BACK THE DAWN, TO EACH HIS OWN, and LADY IN THE DARK (which I don't think I've seen but would love to). He is one of the great UNDISCOVERED directors.Give us DVDs--PLEEEEZE.leisen 
tt0037849;  Amusing and witty story of a street girl (Paulette Goddard) in 18th century London, who rises to become a duchess.Of particular note is Constance Collier, showing off a brilliant flare for comedy as Lady Susan Dowitt, an aging courtesan who instructs Goddard in matters of gentility.  Constance had a long career on stage and screen going back to the silent era, and this film displays her talents as a fine comedienne.
tt0037849;  I remembered this one from TV a hundred years ago. Paulette Goddard has the title role, and she is quite beautiful and completely convincing. Real-er than Eliza Doolittle, she slips in and out'a Houndsditch slang, but she is never comic or plays it broad.  She is a lady long before she marries into royalty.Her persistent love of Hugh (played at his caddish-sexy best by Ray Milland) is the engine that drives the story.  Plenty of good supporting roles, including Sara Algood, Cecil Kallaway (playing Gainsborough),Eric Blore, and that divinely handsome eternal man-who-loses-the-girl, Patric Knowles.I loved it - and though I am not a great Ray Milland fan, I find he can be very convincing as a lover.  His only better example of it is "Golden Earrings" with Miss Marlene Dietrich. And as for Miss Goddard, we never saw enough of her to type-cast her - feisty, spirited, yes, but a little unexpected in the depth of her performance, and a very lovely lady to boot.This is what movies used to be - good characters (somebody to root for), an intelligent story, and Glamour. I recommend this picture highly!
tt0037849; Other IMDb comments on this one tell all that ought to be said about this lavish feast, unaccountably mounted in black-and-white when Technicolor was obviously called for.  I suspect that the iron control that Natalie Kalmus exercised on almost every Technicolor film made through at least the mid-Forties discouraged many a producer from adding the extra expense to the budget, burdening his crew with the cumbersome three-strip cameras and the hellishly hot lighting they required, and the high cost of the final prints.  Now that virtually every film is made in color, we forget that making a film in color prior to the introduction of Technicolor's own single-strip process and its rivals (i.e., Metrocolor, Warnercolor, DeLuxe Color, etc.) was a very big deal, indeed.  Which is not in the least meant to say that Hollywood's artisans did not achieve some memorably beautiful work using black-and-white cameras.  "Kitty" is a prime example, with a luxurious production and a cast fully able to flesh out the script's frequently funny evocation of a very pre-modern England.  Even on a TV broadcast which I caught many years ago, this one was a thoroughly entertaining and eye-filling treat, and it would certainly merit a VHS and/or DVD release in my estimation. 
tt0037849;  Mitchell Leisen was at the top of his form as a director in the mid-'40s and KITTY is a high point in his career, as it is for Paulette Goddard. This is the tale of a sharp-tongued guttersnipe (Goddard) who rises to become a Duchess in society thanks to the manipulations of the scheming Ray Milland and Constance Collier. It's a variation of the Pygmalion tale, a 'My Fair Lady' without music, sumptuously photographed in glorious B&W photography, although it's one of those costume films that would have looked even more ravishing in technicolor.As for any further comment on the film, here's what I wrote in a recent article on the career of PAULETTE GODDARD:"When Paramount failed to make a successful bid for 'Forever Amber', they decided to make their own costume drama about a poor wench from 18th century London who rises from guttersnipe to society woman. Paulette gives undoubtedly one of her best performances in a lavish period film that should have been in color. The N.Y. Times noted: 'Paulette Goddard has worked up blazing temperament to go with her ravishing beauty in the title role. If she is less fetching as a late 18th century duchess, it is because the script runs thin on humor and drama. In any case, she gives the work the correct touch of wry romanticism.'" 
tt0037849; I am absolutely smitten with Paulette Goddard. She is incredibly beautiful and such an immensely gifted actress. Yet I have seen so few of her films. Why is that? Here she is a sheer delight as the Duchess of Malmuster. She made me laugh. She tugged at my heart. She mesmerized me with her beauty. And she made me root for her.I am not such a fan of Ray Milland. In this film his character, Sir Hugh Marcy, is a gold- digging, self-absorbed schemer. In one particular scene, he refuses to leave the Lady's residence, ordering around her servants as if they were his own and forcing his way into her dressing room in some misguided cinematic display of "love." In truth, Marcy is a domineering manipulator. In this entire film he has two scenes in which he is sympathetic. Sandwiched between those two scenes, he executes a plan to expose Lady Malmuster, dragging her back into her "Houndsditch" gutter and sabotaging her engagement to his supposed friend, Lord Carstairs. In reality, this little ploy likely would have been very hurtful to both the Lord and Lady. However, in the unreal realm of Hollywood filmdom, the Lady throws over the fine Lord Carstairs to take back the foul Marcy, and the audience is supposed to believe she lives happily ever after with this lout.The film kept me guessing whether it would end happily or unhappily for the lovely heroine. I had been hoping for an ending worthy of her. What a terrible disappointment that she should end up with the likes of Lord Marcy. She deserved so much better. This film would have been an 8 or 9 with a better ending. 
tt0037849; This film is one of my favorites---just a whole heck of a lot of fun, but how I wish it were in COLOR! The costumes are beautiful. For a frivolous trip back to George III's England (great for a rainy night and a cup of tea), you'll enjoy this movie. A 1940s "chick flick", for sure. I even bought the movie book off eBay, with pictures from the film. Kitty, in the original book, is a real tramp---a female Tom Jones almost. They certainly toned that down in the movie script. Reginald Owen as the Duke of Malmunster is a riot and nearly outshines Paulette Goddard's character. Ray Milland is also wonderful. I love the "oldies", and this one is right at the top. Have a jolly good time with this. Cheers! 
tt0037849; I also remember watching this film on AMC and loved it to death, it is a twist on the Pygmalian story with lots more sass, and gritty, but in a total Old Hollywood glamor. Which seems to make no sense but that is why this is such a gem of a film. Eliza Doolittle would not last two seconds with Kitty in the room, she's a lot more earthy than most heroines and reminds me in some respects of Becky Sharp from Vanity Fair in her single minded climb to the top. All in all a great actress playing a part that is the best of some great female characters all in one juicy and sassy package. This film is well worth preserving, and bring into the modern format of DVD, hopefully with restored picture and sound. 
tt0037849; Some 20 years ago, I left my VCR recording late at night, there used to be good movies on TV at 3 or 4 a.m. I expected to enjoy the movie, but I didn't know it was going to be the movie of my life! I just love it! I kept the VHS for years, unfortunately, I moved and I lost it. I still hope some day we'll get a DVD edition for it would be a pity such an excellent movie could fall into oblivion without letting everybody enjoy it. I particularly enjoyed seeing the evolution of Paulette, she goes from a guttersnipe to a lady and the transformation is perfect.."she's become that lady"..and she really had.. "Love a duck me pearls!" "Sir, a joke is never as funny the second time".DVD NOW!!! 
tt0472113; I saw this film at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival.Iron Island is the second feature film from Iranian director Mohammad Rasoulof, who also wrote the screenplay. Iron Island refers to an old, abandoned oil tanker floating in the Persian Gulf, populated with all sorts of people and presided over by Captain Nemat (Ali Nasirian). The ship is a miniature city, with its own school and barter economy, and Nemat is constantly running about, seeing to the needs of the people under his protection, while at the same time overseeing the gradual disassembly of the ship for scrap metal.The ship contains a whole coterie of characters, including the young man Nemat adopted who is in love with a girl betrothed to another man, the old man who is constantly looking out into the distance for who-knows-what, the young boy who is trying to rescue fish from the hold and return them to the ocean, the teacher who insists the boat is slowly sinking. Under threat from the authorities to abandon the ship, Nemat must decide what to do to keep his little city together.The film was enjoyable, and it was fascinating to watch the society that Nemat had built up on his own little floating island. The characters were absorbing to watch, especially Nemat, who seemed to be partially motivated out of love for his charges, and partly because he wouldn't know what to do with himself if he wasn't leading the people.Director Mohammad Rasoulof attended the screening and did a Q&A: - The film is about the isolation and loneliness of a society, but one that still has a beautiful life.- The story is purely fictional.- Nemat disconnects the people from the outside world from the moment they arrive, resulting in the people willing to follow or do whatever the captain wants. When a society is completely cut off from the outside, whatever is left rules you.- The film has not yet screened in Iran, they are currently waiting permission that has been promised to them.- Every film, poetic or not, goes back to the filmmaker and what they want to say, and this film is what Rasoulof wants to say.- Any artistic work has many different layers, with the plot/story being the one on top. The same thing happens in different places, not just one society. The film is not a metaphor for Iran in particular.- The script was originally written as a theatre piece 10 years ago. Rasoulof rewrote it two years ago, and put the ship as a character in it.- The cast and crew of about 350 had to commute 10 km a day to the ship.- The people in the area where filming took place are very religious and were uncomfortable with the idea of being in a film, so Rasoulof had to go to an area about 60 km away, where many of the people had emigrated from elsewhere, for his cast.- Ali Nasirian, who plays Captain Nemat, is a renowned actor in Iran, and did a lot for the film.- Each one of the characters in the film is based on someone Rasoulof knows. The little fish boy is based on his own childhood and that of his brother. The man watching the horizon is someone Rasoulof remembers from growing up. The teacher is someone he knows well.- The idea for the ship just came to Rasoulof, and he wasn't sure how. He just said there are times one is inspired by such ideas.- There is one scene when the older boys are watching satellite TV. The TV was originally supposed to be playing Titanic, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, but they couldn't get the copyright to do so.- On the issue of censorship, Rasoulof said he basically made the movie he wanted to, and let the censors excise what they wanted. 
tt0472113; Iron Island (Jezireh ahani 2005), the second film written and directed by Iranian Mohammad Rasoulof, is a loosely constructed parable. Rasoulof conceived his tale originally as a theater piece, then turned it into a film by adopting a derelict oil tanker in the Persian Gulf as the setting and populating it with non-actors, sunni ethnic Arab Bandaris, a marginal group in Iran. The resulting style is a cross between Makhmalbaf and post-war Italian neorealism. One might think of the rusty ship with its squatters as like the shantytown in De Sica and Zavattini's Miracle in Milan, but things here are grimmer and more elemental. Everything revolves around a kind of benevolent dictator, a "Captain" (well-known actor Ali Nasirian), who cuts deals, settles disputes, and gives out orders. The Captain's full of friendly greetings for everybody but up close is an exploiter and not to be trusted. How all these people wound up here is a mystery but it provides Rasoulof with a ready-made microcosm. The meanings are up to you. There's crude oil on the ship and a gang of boys the Captain keeps working for him carry it and carved off scrap iron and sell both to buyers on land. Later the boys find a TV and get it working but the Captain grabs it and throws it overboard in anger. There's a teacher who teaches his charges to read using old newspapers and explains that the ship is in the sea and the sea is beautiful and is part of the world. Later when things get complicated because the Captain is going to give up the ship he removes the students and leaves the teacher to make chalk and give lessons to an empty classroom, and donkeys are stabled there instead. There's a special boy named Ahmad (Hossein Farzi-Zadeh) whom the Captain has adopted as his protA©gA© but rather looks down on. The boy's in love with a girl on board, but she's to marry an older man the captain has arranged and he forbids Ahmad to go near her. But he cannot obey. Things are bartered and in one brief but highly charged scene Ahmad and the betrothed girl he fancies without seeing each other exchange clothing -- his T-shirt, her veil -- back and forth on a rope, as if they're undressing for each other and also trading love tokens. When the wedding takes place, in his frustration Ahmad steals the Captain's motorboat and escapes from the ship, but he's caught and subjected to cruel water torture with the entire community watching on deck: now we know this dictator isn't really so benevolent after all. The Bandari women wear veils that look like Venetian carnival masks. There's a dark, bright-eyed little boy people call Fish who rescues aquatic creatures who've slipped into the hold and takes them up and frees them. There's an old man in shades who stands outside looking at the sun all day, awaiting a sign. There's a handicapped boy whose daily assignment is to operate the mechanized lift that's used to bring people up and down from the ship. He also gets to carry out the water torture -- because Ahmad, bound hand and foot, is lowered into the sea on the lift -- and he revels in it. The teacher has been conducting a test that shows the ship is sinking. The captain rejects this assertion at first, but bowing to the inevitable in time gets everybody on board to sign over power of attorney to him, takes them on a "pilgrimage" to the desert, and sells the ship to businessmen for scrap. He promises the people will have a town that will be beautiful, but we don't believe him. The last images are of Fish trying to save fishes along the shore Â<U+0096> he has run away, but his project seems more futile than ever, though just as sweet. Rasoulof's narrative is rather haphazard. At times it seemed to me the relationships might have had more depth if the people were presented in an ordinary community, the boy's longing for the betrothed girl, for instance, and the schoolteacher whose classroom is at the whim of a local mayor. What would have become of the boy freeing fishes and the old man staring at the sun in normal conditions I don't know. The rusty ship may have struck the director as a wonderful idea but it turns out to be a bit of an albatross, a weighty but empty metaphor distracting us from more interesting human detail. But since this captain and his arbitrary world sticks in the mind, perhaps the whole thing wasn't such a bad idea after all. The cinematography makes good use of the authentic faces and the natural, often very low light Â<U+0096> contrasting with dazzling moments of sun. There are really three films here: one composed of of lovely images, another of rough parables, a third of social anecdotes. J.Hoberman wondered in his review how this film was shown at home and what it would mean there. It was shown in the New Directors/New Films series at the Film Society of Lincoln Center (March 2006) and then at Cinema Village, also in New York, but the film hasn't been shown in Iran yet, so those questions can't yet be answered.

tt0472113; I was most impressed by this movie, especially since I was going to it (with my wife) out of a sense of duty: it wasn't one of my choices at Toronto Film Festival. Frankly, I expected to be baffled and bored, as I have been by terribly earnest subtitled movies in the past. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it held my interest from the first scene. The unusual setting had a great deal to do with this -- the ship's crumbling superstructure, its dank and scary innards, the small domestic comforts of its tenants, the vast watery landscape outside -- all beautifully filmed. You are dumped right into the middle of all this, as if you were one of the tenants newly arrived, and watch a newbie get the full treatment from the Captain -- the leader and self-styled benefactor of this band of poor outcasts. You find your way around and get to know the people and their ways, but this is not a documentary, nor does it pretend to be. Our interest is not sociological, but just human. The Captain is at the centre of all this, and his character is at issue throughout. Is he really a saviour and benefactor, or is he just using the young men on board as a source of cheap (free, actually) labour so he can steal the remaining crude oil and valuable parts from the ship, before its owners send it to be cut up for scrap? By the time you have absorbed enough of the narrative to wonder about this, you have grown acquainted enough with the tenants' problems and aspirations to care deeply about this, and to follow his actions with keen attention. In the end, the viewer has to make up his own mind about the character of the man, the rightness of his actions. There is no foregone conclusion. 
tt0472113; "Iron Island (Jazireh ahani)" vividly works on at least three levels. Opening with a prayer, the premise itself is visually arresting and the story is simple but imaginative. Settled on an abandoned oil freighter off the coast of an unnamed Middle East peninsula, a rag tag community of squatters is ruled by a wheeling-dealing landlord, a benevolent, Messianic dictator of a captain, like out of a Werner Herzog film, controlling a limited barter economy with the outside world. The huge hulking ship in the bright blue sea is eye-popping, but it even feels like writer/director Mohammad Rasoulof is just pointing his camera at at a documentary of how traditional families adapt to such a physical and economic environment while retaining their social structure with its rigid gender and age stratification. I equally believed, on the one hand, this could be a post-apocalyptic society as in the "Mad Max" movies or "Waterworld", the new "Battlestar Galactica" or even "Land of the Dead" or, on the other, that it could even have been based on a true story, as much as "Nobody Knows (Dare mo shiranai)" was based on a real incident in Japan of abandoned children.But it works equally well visually, emotionally and intellectually as a brilliant allegory, not necessarily of Iran but of any traditional, isolated society with a rotting infrastructure, selling off its resources and A©migrA©s to global capitalism and living off the promises and lies of its paternalistic leaders.Working under the captain's watchful eye, the frustrated school teacher, a Cassandra-like scientist, uses the Islamic madrassas style of repetitive memorization. But with only old newspapers about a mysterious war and enemy as texts, the students are required to repeat truisms about the glories of living on the sea. Unfortunately, the English subtitles do not translate what is on the black board so some subtleties are doubtless lost.Just as any society has channeled restless adolescent boys into armies, the "Captain" (a marvelously oily and charismatic Ali Nassirian) organizes the boys on board into teams of coordinated manual labor to salvage resources on the ship that have the breathtaking look of "Nanook of the North" teams ritualistically pulling together for a common goal and their choreography is a wonder. Even so, they still keep trying to get snatches of contact to the outside world with satellite TV and radio.But we get caught up on in the story of one of these adolescents, his assistant, a lovelorn orphan (played by Hossein Farzi-Zadeh who also movingly played a similar young man in "Beautiful City (Shah-re ziba)"), who stands up to him, recalling "Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner", or a more cerebral "Star Wars", with an even more dramatically wrenching rebellion. How young love finds an outlet even through elaborate burhkas is a touching tribute to the universality of the human spirit. The audience held their breaths as to who would win the battle of wits and endurance.Women are especially ground under in this patriarchal society, with physical and labor restrictions and barely puberty arranged marriages around issues of honor. A lack of health care particularly affects the constantly pregnant, child-caring women.The premise doesn't make 100% practical sense and the ending is so ambiguous that the guy next to me optimistically thought it was happy for all, while I was cynically dismayed. But the images are unforgettable. 
tt0472113; This is an ingenious, scathingly ironic, highly critical allegory about conditions today in Iran, written by the director, Mohammad Rasoulof. Nearly the entire drama takes place on an old, disabled oil tanker that is very slowly sinking into the sea. The ship is crammed with people of all ages and varying life stations, though there does not appear to be anyone on board who's rich.There are also animals, people tending vegetable gardens, a cleverly rigged cell phone service. Everyone is put to work, has a role to play. A wheelchair bound young man with cerebral palsy manages the rickety lift that transports people and goods up and down to the water line. A youngster ("Baby Fish") picks up small fish trapped below decks and returns them to the sea.The enterprise is run Â<U+0096> better, micromanaged - with an iron hand by Captain Nemat (Ali Nassirian). He's everywhere: checking out every worker on the job, greeting newcomers and settling them in, brokering marriage contracts, tending to the needs of the ill and impoverished, ordering tools and goods from the mainland on his cell (he's the only one aboard with a personal phone), dickering with the ship's owners, who want to evacuate everyone and sell the old hulk to a scrapper.Unbeknownst to them, a major source of income for this floating colony is torching away pieces of the vessel and selling them to a scrapper. The costs of goods like purchased food and medicines is deducted from people's pay, like a company store operates.There is a school aboard ship, run by an enlightened, middle aged teacher who is keenly resourceful. For example, he makes his own blackboard chalk sticks using old bullet casings for molds, a marvelous spin of the traditional image of turning swords into ploughshares. This school is no madrasa: he teaches natural science and the 3 R's to a coed lot of kids of all ages (a family arrives with three teen daughters, none of whom has ever been to school, the teacher quickly learns).Capt. Nemat is not happy about this school or its teacher's ways. He bickers with the teacher about the latter's measurements that demonstrate how rapidly the ship is sinking: at the rate he estimates, it will only stay afloat for a few more years. Nemat dismisses this as a spurious finding. He finds any pretext to interrupt classes. One day it's a ship-wide celebration. Another day it's a need for the kids to aid in a special work project. Still later Nemat insists that two donkeys must be housed in the classroom.Nemat also insists that women wear burkas, and have traditionally arranged marriages. He metes out harsh punishment to those who transgress the rules, like young Ahmad, who keeps hitting on a girl Nemat deems too good for him, and who later tries to escape the ship. In an act of obvious defiance, the teacher, displaced by the donkeys, draws a chalk face: a woman without a burka.A major breakthrough occurs: workers are finally able to tap into the oil reserves tanked below decks. Oil in partly filled drums is floated to land and sold. But even with that development, Capt. Nemat cannot fend off the evacuation demands of the ship's owners. So he forces everyone to grant him their powers of attorney in order to wheel and deal on their behalf as he chooses. His choice is to have everyone leave the ship, but not in order to end their isolation.Quite to the contrary, Nemat directs his people to establish a new home, far removed from civilization, on a bleak patch of desert. They will start over, from scratch. The metaphor for a logical conclusion to radical Muslim fundamentalism could not be more clear.Subject to the usual caveat that everybody shouts at the top their lungs, even when standing nose to nose, a style that is common and annoying in Iranian film dialogue, this is a sensational film, and one can only marvel that it was made in the first place, let alone exported to the West. My grade: B+ 8/10. 
tt0472113; While the works of maestro Kiarostami and Makhmalbaf are part of a more philosophical, sometimes Godardian/Haneke avant garde film school, Iron Island represents another side of iranian cinema, one that is closer to the classic "greek" Hollywood style. The plot driven film. But this is a plot driven film that also uses the plot to present a satire of the society. Not only the iranian but a more general comment on the modern society. The director is very precise and throughoughly chooses simple but strong symbols on presenting his work. A miniatyre society (on a rusty old oil tanker in the persian gulf that is constantly sinking) lead by captain Nemat. There is a fully (dis)functional society on this boat. Nemat is a strong totalitarian leader but a balanced person thats very hard to judge. Nemats complex character is one of the most well crafted and vital parts of this film. There is also a love story off course. A forbidden love between two of the youths on this boat. Nemat, these two youths a teacher/scientist and dozen of other characters each represent a person and a way of thinking that in addition to being autonome characters also are used to show Nemat. These persons are also used to show Nemat, by showing Nemats reaction to these people.Also the imagery is fantastic. The old rusty tanker a great contrast to the blue sea. Brown and yellow against the blue sea and the sky. Nemats (Nassirian is one of the most important theatre and film actors in Iran) face expressions alone, are just incredible (one can see parallels in the use of face expression to Eisensteins "Potemkin").In short, Iron Island is one of the most interesting Iranian films in a long time. 
tt0472113; You will not find a better metaphorical study of Post-revolution Iran than this film, one so threatening that the Iranian authorities tossed famed director Rasoulof into the brig. A self-absorbed captain of a stalled and sinking ship runs his vessel like a clueless despot, ripping off hard-working but naAve passengers. Exploited onboard youth get meaningless education, and a lovelorn adolescent who bolts for a better life gets tortured, mostly to deter other kids. The lying captain inefficiently uses the scant ship resources, like steel and oil, and misapplies the proceeds to strand his impoverished subjects in an arid land. There is a bud of hope at the end, but like reality, if you blink you will miss it. AfroPixFlix drops a 10-forked anchor. 
tt0472113; A fascinating film about a couple of hundred people living on a rusty, abandoned cargo ship stranded on a shoal off the coast of Iran. A fictional story that also works as a revealing documentary about how a community can organize life in such an unlikely place. Captain Nemat rules unchallenged over the residents: divvying responsibilities, dispensing medicines, organizing marriages, etc. He is the primary character, but the star of the film is the ship. The remaining oil in the tanks is drilled and pumped out to be sold onshore. The barrels scene that explains it is mesmerizing. In an ironic touch, the innards and unessential structures are being cut to be sold as scrap metal. Oil and metal thus form the two main sources of income. Those of course are finite. Moreover the ship is slowing sinking into the shoal. The days of the community on board are numbered. Nemat is well aware of this though he tries to hide the fact from the residents so as not to alarm them. But Nemat has a plan whose execution propels the story to an unsettling conclusion.There is a Romeo and Juliet subplot with a forced marriage that makes us suspect Nemat. When Nemat makes a deal to sell the ship for scrap and claims that the money will be used to relocate the community to a site on land, our suspicions increase. Is he going to run away with the money? The ending, especially the final scene with the "Fish" boy, is not immediately apparent, but upon reflection it is a pointed commentary on the future of the community as it relocates from its iron island to an arid stretch of blanched earth. A fish stranded in a small and shallow tidal pool is freed by "Fish", but he quickly realizes that several feet away, a line of unmanned fishing nets planted a short distance from the shore await. Well done! 
tt0079523; It's kind of an interesting story how I got into watching 70's Italian sex comedies. Like many other people, I'm a big fan of Italian gialli and Italian crime thrillers, and I followed a couple of the alluring actresses that appeared in those--mainly Edwige Fenech and Gloria Guida--into some of their other Italian films (even though these were much less likely to be legitimately released and/or available in English-friendly editions). The vast majority of 70's Italian sex comedies are quite stupid and the only thing they really have going for them is a generous helping of female nudity. At some point though, I got to actually kind of LIKE these movies, especially the ones featuring comedians like Lando Buzzanco or Renzo Montagnini, but even some of the more infantile Italian buffoons like Alvaro Vitali or Lino Banfi have their moments. I've seen very little of the work of Adrian Celentano, who probably has the most laconic style of any of the male Italian comedians of that era, but this is by far the best of his movies that I've seen.Like your better Italian comedies, this one actually has a PLOT! Celentano is an engineer who has invented a kind of theft-proof glass that has wreaked havoc in the criminal underworld. By chance, he meets a beautiful female thief (Eleanora Giorgi) who robs him on the subway and then later takes care of him after he gets in a bicycle accident. He gets mixed up with her crazy family, who are all thieves, and pretends to be a thief himself, all the while trying to hide his true identity.This movies is actually pretty entertaining despite being in Italian and having pretty much no female nudity. Giorgi is a little higher class then most actresses that appeared in these movies (even if she rarely leaves her clothes on for an entire movie like she does here). She is actually quite good in this. Olga Karlatos (most famous from Lucio Fulci's "Zombi") doesn't have much to do though as Celentano's wife. The sexiest actress though might be Ania Pieroni, Centano's mistress in this, who had small but important parts in Fulci and Dario Argento movies (she was the original "Mother of Tears" in "Inferno"). She is smoldering hot in this movie even with her clothes on, but if you want to see a lot, um, more of her check out "Stay the Way You Are" where she plays the college roommate of a young Nastassia Kinski, but never actually shares the screen with her because I'm pretty sure it would have melted the celluloid in the camera. But enough rhapsodizing about sexy Italian actresses--suffice it to say this movie has a good cast, a good story, and is pretty entertaining (even in Italian). I'd recommend it. 
tt0079523;  I was very enjoyed! :) funny, subtle, NON-hollywood movie with talented actors and Adriano Celentano, of course! Each character is drawn perfectly. If you see it - you won't be disappointed - it's NOT "2001: Space Travesty" or "Scary movie" or the like ,)One bad thing: the final is not as good as it can be - that's why i voted only 9 :)  
tt1471247; *this review contains no spoilers* I went to watch Road to Sangam only knowing that it was a film with a connection with Gandhi and had won some awards. What transpired on the screen in the next 135 minutes changed my perception of Gandhi and changed me as a person. I am some one who did not regard Gandhi in the high esteem a lot of people regard him in. He, to me, was some one who was adamant and threatened the nation with his blackmails which were carried out promptly by his followers. What I did not understand was that it was the power of Gandhi's thoughts which made people act the way they did. It had reason, it had logic.Coming to the film. We are given a rationale and the film makes a strong case for it. You almost start believing in the thinking behind it. Then, there is a slow process of change which is so slow and gradual. It is not some thing which happens right away or through a flash bulb of genius. It is realization in process. The way the change is shown is convincing enough for some one to believe in the Gandhian principle.The film has many layers to it. It is a film which asks 'what defines Karma'. It is a film about holding upright the faith Gandhi showed in the muslims of India. It is a film about how a person be it a Muslim or a person of any religion (or even an agnostic or atheist for that matter) should behave. That's the bigger picture.Then the film touches on tough subjects like partition and the role of an Indian Muslim. Many layers and subjects touched, all given due space.Paresh Rawal is excellent in the role of a man who works based on logic and is principled at the same time. I can't think of a better actor to carry out the role. The part of a Muslim from the state of Uttar Pradesh, perfect with the local accent, who has his own little mannerisms and characteristics is played perfectly. The facial expressions are not exaggerated. The lines are spoken with a calm balance about them, exactly how the character would say it.The pace of the movie is neither fast, nor slow. It has it's own rhythm and flows rather than moves. The cinematography is excellent with aspects of small town India (the city Allahabad in this case) shown. There are panoramic views and then there is attention to detail. A man making aloo tikki is shown for instance to capture the flavour of the chaat which is so popular in small town India.Coming to Gandhi films, I have seen quite a few. Gandhi was a great biographical sketch. Gandhi My Father shows the flaws of Gandhi - the father of his son. Lage Raho Munnabhai which was so popular tries to explain the Gandhi way of thinking and does a fair job of it. It has the bollywood masala mixed in it, was perfectly marketed and was a huge success. Gandhigiri became a trend. Sardar, again starring Paresh Rawal (as Sardar Patel), paints Gandhi as a principled, yet stubborn man whose will might have cost India There are umpteenth movies which are presented as documentaries on Gandhi, most of which are holistic. No movie portrays Gandhism, like Road To Sangam does. At least none I have seen.The show I went for was almost canceled as only one other person showed up at the ticket counter. In the end, just five of us came to watch the movie which they did screen thankfully. One engineer who had studied from Allahabad itself remarked that Gandhism is dead as no one turned up for this movie. I remarked that Munnabhai was a huge success. So it is a marketing flaw and lack of funds which meant audiences didn't come to watch this film. There is another aspect to it. It isn't a masala flick like many other bollywood flicks or like Munnabhai. It is not boring in any way, mind.I give the movie a perfect 10/10. Don't think it could have been made better.I just hope more people see it. So go see it and spread the word! 
tt1471247; A small low budget movie that almost no one has heard of Â<U+0096> is one of the most nuanced, heart-warming tales I have seen. It is a story with loads of heart, which all of us need to see Â<U+0096> if for nothing else, to remember who we are as a country. It is a commentary of our times, yet very gently, it questions our conscience about some of our society's beliefs. Story wise, it is like a children's parable, where everything ends well Â<U+0096> the cynical among us might scoff at it. But Road to Sangam's achievement lies in its ability to make us look at each other, in a Gandhian way Â<U+0096> something that we have long forgotten to do, despite Raj Kumar Hirani's best efforts.In Allahabad, Hashmatullah is a sincere, god-fearing motor mechanic, well liked in the community - and is also the general secretary of his neighbourhood mosque committee. He is entrusted with repairs to an old Ford V8 engine, ignorant of its historical significance that it once carried the ashes of Mahatma Gandhi for immersion at the Sangam. He promises he would repair the engine and he would do it as soon as possible. But when some of his innocent neighbours are arrested by the police after some bomb blasts on suspicion of harbouring terrorists, the committee sends out a 'farman' to down shutters in the locality as a protest.At this point, Hashmatullah comes to know the significance of the engine Â<U+0096> and is stuck in a dilemma. One on hand, he wants to finish his work - but to open his shop, he would have to go against the mosque 'farman' and his 'quam'.While on the face of it, it's a story of a common man stuck in a larger-than-life situation, Road to Sargam morphs into a story of how we need to find a common ground between our two communities Â<U+0096> without stepping on each other toes. And the reason why Road to Sangam is such a fantastic movie is that it doesn't do or say anything explicitly Â<U+0096> everything is gently suggested or implied. No flag waving jingoism, nor any flower-giving gandhigiri. Its so nuanced, it would take you a while before you figure out that it could even pass off as a patriotic movie! The star of the show is Paresh Rawal (who in the same week gave a langoor-looking performance in Rann). Its here that he shows us what wonderful performances he is capable of Â<U+0096> because we are in a serious danger of forgetting it after his Priyadarshan movies. In Road to Sargam, he plays Hashmatullah with conviction Â<U+0096> showing us the gradual move from doubt and confusion to resolve. Accompanying him in performance honours is Pawan Malhotra. Playing the jingoist maulvi, his high pitched nasal voice make him almost unrecognizable and very believable. Om Puri doesn't have much dialogues Â<U+0096>and does competently.It would give you an idea of how good or bad the movie is when you consider that Tushhar Gandhi (Mahatma's grandson) plays himself in the movie Â<U+0096> for a considerable part (without dialogues though). Road to Sangam is a non-judgemental look into the collective paranoia of the Muslim society in India Â<U+0096> and how sometimes it just requires a few voices of reason and some patience. The movie does have its fallacies Â<U+0096> some of its scenes should have been written more tightly and the solution director Amit Rai provides is bordering on naAve. But these pitfalls do not distract from the appeal of the movie. Road to Sangam touches your heart with its sincerity and feeling. I repeat, it is something you shouldn't miss.I write about movies regularly at http://bombaycinephile.blogspot.com 
tt1471247; I've finished watching this film few minutes ago. The first thing I did was to come to this site (IMDb)and read the reviews. Seeing that only 7 reviews have been put up so far, I decided to register to this site not really to review but to pay tribute. I am not a critic and cannot comment on the technicalities of the film. I like what 'hits' me and this film has gone for the bullseye. This film sends out an extremely strong, thought-provoking message. I am in my twenties, I wear torn jeans and listen to western music but after watching this movie, somewhere inside I felt guilty. In one of the reviews here I read that only 5 people turned up to watch the film in a theatre which is just sad (and guys like us are to be blamed for it, no excuse). All I want to appeal to the director is (if he is reading the reviews here) to please not get bogged down and please keep gifting us with such thought provoking cinema as long as you can ( our country needs it !). 
tt1471247; "Road to Sangam" affirms the proclamation that small budgeted movies are definitely better than gloss-glittered Chopra'raj & Johar-ism. The movie is straight out of heart, the execution is impeccable. Right from the first-frame it manages to grab the attention of the audience. Thanks to the Munnabhai MBBS, it has rekindled the Gandhi'sim into the audience. Road to Sangam makes a linear progression in the same direction. Casting wise Paresh Rawal, Om Puri & Pavan Malhotra have been thrown in. Had Naseer been roped into the project, it would have been nothing short of casting-coup. â<U+009A> Paresh Rawal: Paresh Rawal should be applauded for the choice of roles he is taking on board, heterogeneous. The character of Anwar Bhai takes a while to build up momentum. Not exactly juxtaposition but more of corroboration that the hardship of Anwar Bhai were akin to struggle of Mohandas Karamchand. â<U+009A> Om Puri: There is no denying that he was in top form. â<U+009A> Pavan Malhotra:: The casting department should be applauded for selecting this unsung hero for the role of mullah. His body language and delivery is nothing short of perfection. One of late-comers from parallel cinema to embrace the mainstream commercial Cinema. But hey-ho, welcome!â<U+009A> Javed Sheikh was adequate.The spirit of the city has been captured effectively. The story progresses quite naturally. For the first timer, the director surely knows his job well.It would be fair to make a statement that "Road to Sangam" was not promoted enough. The word of mouth didn't quite help which is another setback. Its a shame to see duds like "Kurbaan" garnering moolah when a well-deserved movie like "Road To Sangam" perhaps deserves a little bit more attention. 
tt1471247; Today I watched Road To Sangam online on funbolo.com and now I have only one regret that I could not watch it earlier. It's a movie to be watched by every true Indian, every true Muslim and every true human-being. It was released sometime back and to the misfortune of the Indian audience, it was not even took notice of. I really pity that meaningless and mindless movies score on the box office due to the pre-release hype generated for them and outstanding movies like Road To Sangam are not even given a look.A motor workshop owner, Hashmatullah (Paresh Rawal) gets a job of repairing the engine of a very old truck without being aware of the fact that this is the truck which has carried the remains of Gandhiji's body for dispersal in different rivers of the nation and now only one such urn is remaining which is to be carried to Sangam (the amalgamation point of Ganga and Yamuna at Allahabad) for the dispersal of its contents there. Before he could accomplish the job, his community leaders call a strike of the Muslims in protest to the arrest and torture of local Muslims as the aftermath of some explosions in the city. He himself is the general secretary of the concerned committee but once coming to know that the job undertaken by him is related to the remains of Gandhiji, he refuses to become a part of the strike and thus invites the wrath of his community-man. Being a liberal and right-thinking person and taking the inspiration from the life of Gandhiji himself, he finally succeeds in carrying out the job as well as make his community-men understand his point-of-view.This novel idea pertaining to the dispersal of the ashes of Gandhiji has been developed quite proficiently, linking it to the Muslim-psyche and the activities of the fundamentalist elements as well as the negatively thinking elements in the community. How less educated and ill-informed youths are misguided, is shown quite realistically but it raises hope that right-thinking persons can change the scenario if they come to the front and speak to their community brethren fearlessly on related issues. True, the police atrocities and tilted mentality towards the Muslims is also responsible for the already deteriorated and further deteriorating situation in our country, still the Muslims can themselves introspect and look at several things objectively to find out what is right and what is wrong. That insight itself will guide them to move in the right direction. It's always easy to misunderstand others as well as misread the things prevailing. However the movie emphatically underscores the positive and hope-providing fact that proper observation and correct understanding of the things is also very easy. Only the windows of the mind are to be kept open. Right-minded people (which are always there) can come forward and bring about a positive change in the scenario, provided they throw off the burden of fear of the fundamentalists and the vested interests which appear to be mighty but actually may not be.Gandhiji's philosophy of humanity is still relevant which discards all the differences of the mankind whether on the ground of sex or religion or cast or creed or race or province or language or likewise. Through the character of Hashmatullah, it has been propagated once again and this propagation is, in fact, very effective. Though the long dialogues send an air of preaching, the actions of the hero support the talks and do not allow them to appear hollow. The message is pretty clear to the Indian Muslims - 'You have to be the change you want to see in the world.' The narrative takes some time in taking off but once taken off, there is no laxity. Despite the exemplary message, it is not weak on the entertainment front and is very very interesting. The editor could have shortened the length by 15-20 minutes. However the length is not felt very much because there is no boredom.The art director and the cinematographer have done a splendid job by creating the middle class areas of the city on the screen with a high degree of reality. Everything appears in such way that the viewer gets a feeling of witnessing in person whatever is visible on the screen.The performances of all (including the great-grandson of Gandhiji - Tushar Gandhi) are highly admirable. However it's Paresh Rawal's movie who carries it alone on his strong shoulders. He has made himself deserving to be considered among the greatest Indian actors through his talent and toil. In this movie, his hard work speaks for itself.The music of the movie (by Sandesh Shandilya and others) is also good. The very old prayer - Lub Pe Aati Hai Dua Bann Ke Tamanna Teri and the Qawwaali - Hum Subah Ke Bhoolon Ko (sung by Vijay Mishra, Ghulam Qadir Khan & Ghulam Murtuza Khan) are specially mentionable. The devotional songs dear to Gandhiji have also been incorporated suitably and emphatically.Summing up, producer - Amit Chheda and writer-director Amit Rai have done an outstanding job. It's a movie pronouncing the message of the Mahatma, the message of humanity without any overtones or rhetorics. It has won several international awards but not the viewership of the Indian audience. I recommend this movie as a must-watch for every right-thinking Indian. Nobody willing to watch meaningful and purposeful cinema should miss this masterpiece. 
tt1471247; Just finished watching this gem, and here are my 2 cents. First of all, I think one needs to commend the acting. Paresh Rawal absolutely nails this one, being a progressive yet devout Muslim that is torn between communal persuasion and personal beliefs. Om Puri as others have said plays a decent role with whatever limited space he is given. Pavan Malhotra, according to me is equally good as Paresh Rawal in his role as a Maulwi. Overall, see this movie for its simplicity, personal triumph, social dilemmas, communal barriers, and finally for some interesting facts about the 'Mahatma'. I don't want to give away too much, but will leave with saying that if you are Indian and have witnessed communal riots this movie will definitely leave a mark on you. 
tt1471247; It somehow seems like every other unconventional Hindi movie these days is aligned to either showcase Mumbai's undeniable spirit as a city that has seen the heights of mass peril or to herald a pro-Muslim message to those who might not already have heard it. Of the two, if we take a look at that rather colorful array of movies that have attempted to paint Islamic fundamentalism in a shade more palatable to the untrained layman palette, some great examples ('Aamir','Sarfarosh'), some decent instances ('Anwar','Yeh Hai Mera India','Yeh Hai Mumbai Meri Jaan') and some Herculean debacles('My name is Khan', 'Kurbaan') come to the foreground. Whilst all the aforementioned movies had varying degrees of success with portraying the life and times of an ordinary Muslim in today's India, there has never really been an attempt to juxtapose the Muslim community against Gandhi's backdrop. For that, 'Road to Sangam'(RTS) has my respect.Now, I am not a hardcore Gandhian. I have read abundant material on the man, exhaustive literature on his legend and certainly seen a dozen variations of his mantra in recent celluloid years. Notwithstanding my personal views of the Mahatma, I was getting a tad frustrated at how almost every movie that used him as the nucleus, would invariably get so sugary at one point that one could die instantly from that lethal injection of diabetic shock. His message of global peace, non-violence and inter-communal brotherhood would be echoed way beyond the subtle reality it so desperately needed. Thus, making an erstwhile honest attempt, seem preachy and philosophical.What makes RTS more authentic in such a stereotypical scenario is how it attempts to demystify the reasons why Maulwi saahibs and other patriarchal Muslims are screaming from atop mosque enclosures and what the everyday worker is hearing sitting in front of them, convinced that they know more about what being a true Muslim is. RTS dissects that so neatly that it takes your breathe away.The premise revolves around Hashmatullah (Paresh Rawal), a renowned mechanic and a devout Muslim, who works out of his grease stained garage in Allahabad. He is the general secretary of his community's organization which is headed by one time friend Mohammad Ali Kasuri (Om Puri) and the local Maulwi Maulana Qureshi (Pavan Malhotra). Hashmat is a non-threatening fellow who sits in on rhetorical meetings spilling with the irate and cranky Maulwi's never ending rants about how Muslims are being targeted each day in today's India. Despite his ideology that are slightly different from that of his peers, he does not see the need to voice his philosophy in their presence. He nods his head, joins in their hymns and plays his role to the T.And then one day a bomb goes off. A few prominent Muslims are arrested by the police and this sends shocks of rage across the community. They unanimously agree to shut down their businesses in protest of what they are convinced is a racist act. Hashmat, without a choice, reluctantly joins in not realizing that a recent project that has come his way, of fixing an age old Ford's rusty and dead engine, is in fact of the same vehicle that had once carried the Mahatma's ashes after his death in 1948. This, for a reason he cannot completely fathom, changes Hashmat's priorities.On the one hand he does consider himself a true follower of the Koran and a blue blooded supporter of his organization. On the other, there is his conscience that continues to prick him into the confession that his little deed of helping the Mahatma's final bounty of ashes to be submerged into the Triveni Sangam (a spot where the rivers Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati meet), somehow seems like a more justified statement of Muslim being a faith of peace, rather than shutting off work and listening to a radically inclined Mullah each day. Thus, aware of the respect he knows he needs to pay to the man who was assassinated for being an open supporter of the Muslims, Hashmat prepares to face the wrath of his own kin by reopening his shop to fix the engine. Hashmat's personal journey of awareness lit brightly by the knowledge of the true meaning of Islam culminates with the Mahatma's final journey into the rivers of the country he fought so hard to liberate.RTS is no average emotion-heavy movie that is high on religious jingoism without a clear degree of practicality. In fact, it is the most mature movie I have seen on the subject after 'Aamir'. If 'Aamir' was the attempt to present the true anti-thesis of a Jihadi, 'Road to Sangam' paves the way for more clarity on the difference between blind fanatic adherence to one's faith and the need to see the bigger picture. That bigger, brighter, and more appropriate picture.I would definitely recommend a relevant film like 'Road to Sangam' purely because of the honesty with which it unfolds its theme. 
tt1471247; This is one movie that stands above all of Bollywood flicks during 2010.The movie does raise interesting issues such as the devastation of partition that followed India's independence from the oppressive and tyrannical British. While Hindus and Sikhs fled from what is now known as Pakistan, Muslims - especially the one who were affluent enough to afford to travel - were also compelled to flee - amidst scores of killings on both sides.Gandhiji had been frustrated with the verbal tirade between two of his followers: Muhammad Ali Jinnah (whose ancestors were Hindu Rajputs) and Jawaharlal Nehru. He had wanted Jinnah to become the first Prime Minister, but this move was opposed by Nehru - who openly stated that he would not even offer Jinnah the position of a 'chaprasi' in the new Indian cabinet.An enraged Jinnah declared that he will become Prime Minister even if it meant to form another country. And thus began the formation of East and West Pakistan - and the subsequent devastation that followed.Those Hindus and Sikhs, especially Sindhis, who fled from Karachi and other cities - were treated like refugees in their very own country. Gandhiji attempted to bring back Muslim brothers and sisters by announcing that he was going to lead a foot-march to not only compensate but also enable people to return to their original homes and livelihoods.It is not a secret that while Jinnah felt threatened by this movement, several Governors of the newly formed Pakistan openly indicated that they would return to India.Shortly before the foot-march Gandhiji was shot dead by a right-winged Hindu.His remains were placed in urns and immersed in Holy rivers and sites all over India.It is not a secret that with the immersion of his remains - Truth and Righteousness were also subdued and have ultimately disappeared from India/Bharat/Hindustan.Wealthy Maharajahs/Nawabs used their influence and became members of parliament, continued amassing wealth and ignoring the poor, and become tyrannical and oppressive themselves. Result: Rampart corruption in all walks of life, nepotism, favoritism, religious intolerance, violence, and terrorism continue unabated. If not for this partition, a united India would now be a power to be reckoned with.Funds and energy wasted on war, ammunition, defense, and counter-terrorism would have been used to improve the lives of embattled and impoverished citizens in all three countries - Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan.It is never too late as they say 'Subah Ka Bhoola Shyam Ko Ghar Aaye - Toh Ushey Bhoola Nahin Kahetey". 
tt1471247; Sir Richard Attenborough made a movie on Mahatma Gandhi's life back in days ,It was greatly appreciated by everyone including western media and now here in 2010 this is movie about that great Mahatma thoughts but i don't think not many people would spare time to watch and understand this amazing movie. Paresh Rawal is a brilliant actor and in this movie he has acted like a true Indian.Om Puri has done justice to his part.Everyone in the movie has acted good. We need this kind of a movie in today's time when there is so much fight about different religions.My biggest surprise is that Most Indian Currency note have Mahatma Gandhi on them , yet people fail to understand the true message of Gandhian thought. Being an Indian has got nothing to do with a religion. Indian doesn't Mean a Hindu or a Punjabi ,why we have been denying it for past 63 years that Muslims are Indians as well.Religion is secondary , Nation is first. I loved the movie because i am a Patriotic Indian.I am Proud to be an Indian. 
tt1471247; Well, this is one unnoticed movie in Bollywood. No one has ever heard about this movie, which is quite unfortunate. Even I was unaware of this beauty until my brother referred this movie to me. My first question was, "which movie is this?, I have never heard" He replied, it has Paresh Rawal and Om Puri, and this is the only thing which tempted movie.After watching this excellent piece of work I was surprised. I regretted to remain in the dark about this movie for at least 3 years. Paresh Rawal played the role of a "human being" who is not in the clutches of religion. He is a simple middle class mechanic, who truly understand the Islam unlike the other fundamentalist. I am not qualified enough to comment on his acting. Om Puri, on the other hand, is a religious zealot. Moreover, being a citizen of Indian he is inclined more towards Pakistan. We see a picture of Mohammed Jinnah hanging on his wall. We see pictures of Pakistani Cricketers too. It shows that he is not satisfied with the Indian Government and Indian people, mainly Hindus as they provide hostile treatment to Muslims.Pawan Malhotra played a role of Maulana which could not have been played by any other person, I bet. He is again a zealot, but different from Om Puri. He will never change. His acting is mind blowing. How to make a movie on Gandhi? Find a good actor, making him bald, make him weak, make him protest on reel life against the British.. and you have a movie. ROAD TO SANGAM, on the other hand, teaches us to remember GANDHI by not making his character live on the REEL life, but to weave the ideologies in our lives. This is the only movie which pays homage to GANDHI. Hats off AMIT RAI, the writer and director. For those people who have not watched this movie, pls do ureselves a favour and watch it immediately. It is one the best movie in Indian cinema. This one is a treat to watch. Watch it for ACTING, watch is for the real issue which the movie introduces, watch it for humanity....JUST GO AND WATCH !!!!! 
tt0423277;  [some plot spoilers] I am a sucker for dog movies in any case, but combine an adorable Scottish Terrier with the two wonderful child actors who are the leads in this film and you have a winner. The performance by the 7 year old girl Gol Ghoti is particularly outstanding. The young boy Zahed also has several great moments especially some of a black comedic vein in exchanges with a jail guard.Briefly the plot involves a sister and brother who are 'night prisoners' at a prison where their mother is being kept on some sort of bigamy/adultery charges as she had remarried when her Taliban husband had disappeared for 5 years during various wars. Her second husband dies but the first husband returns and has her jailed, then he himself is jailed by the Americans for being Taliban. The kids are able to stay overnight at least with the mother while gathering wood and picking for articles from the dump during the day to make a living. Then the prison governor changes the rules and the kids are out on the street at night as well. They have adopted a stray dog in the meantime after rescuing it from a gang of kids who were tormenting it. They and their pet are collectively the 'stray dogs' of the title.The kids then proceed thru a comedy of errors to try to get caught stealing so that they can be sentenced to prison and rejoin their mother. A charming sequence is done in tribute to Vittorio De Sica's 'The Bicycle Thief' which the kids actually go to see at the Kabul cinema in order to gather tips and inspiration for their attempted crimes.A lot of this probably sounds very bleak and depressing but the spirit of the kids, their charming dog and their love for each other and family lets this film rise above the harsh circumstances that they face and convey a heartwarming (and at times heartbreaking) tale of endurance and love.This is the 2nd film by Iranian director Meshkini who developed the idea while working on scouting the Afghan locations for Samira Makhmalbaf's 'At Five in the Afternoon'.So far (Sept 2004) I believe this has only played at the Venice and Toronto Film Festivals but it hopefully will receive a wider distribution. In 90 minutes this film lets you feel more for the Afghan experience than many other and longer histories or documentaries could convey.9/10  
tt0423277; At first I was hesitant to watch this film since at the beginning the look of the two children frankly drew me away from it thinking it would be very depressing. But since there was nothing better to watch on my crappy cable system, I stayed and do not regret it one bit. I fell in love with the two characters. Their performance was unbelievable since they are very young and not professionals. I did not find the end very sad since it leaves you with a sense of hope because the little girl had such a strong spirit that you want to feel she will be alright despite the terrible social and cultural situations that prevail in those countries. 
tt0423277; Marzieh Meshkini directs "Stray Dogs", a film whose title conjures up Kurosawa's "Stray Dog" but whose plot recalls De Sica's "Bicycle Thieves" and Bunuel's "Los Olvidados".The story? Zahed and Goi-Ghotai are a couple of streetwise kids Â<U+0096> played not by professional actors but by real kids pulled from the slums of Kabul Â<U+0096> who struggle to survive on the riverbanks of Kabul, the largest city in Afghanistan. With their parents in jail, the duo spend their days rummaging through filth and debris, desperately looking for anything they can eat, sell or burn for warmth. They aren't alone in their hardships, though, as Meshkini makes it clear that thousands of similar "lost children" populate the war torn country.De Sica's influence is given a nod during one scene in which the kids watch "Bicycle Thieves" at a grimy theatre. Seeing the film gives them an idea. If they get arrested for stealing, they'll be thrown into jail and will therefore be put back into contact with their parents. Won't they? Of course things go tragically wrong. Before this, however, the film touches upon the effects of the US-Taliban war in Afghanistan, Meshkini frequently cutting away to US war planes high in the sky. The slum children themselves express their contempt for the invaders by bullying a little dog (the stray dog of the title), an animal which eventually becomes a clunky metaphor for stolen childhood and the replacement of love with warfare.Though the film is designed to show Western audiences the effect warfare and invasion (be it instigated by the US or Russia) have on foreign cultures and families, it's also critical of a certain outdated tribalism. For example, the father of our heroes is a Taliban who was moved to a mysterious US prison. With her husband absent for five years, the kids' mother then remarried, which in the eyes of both local law and culture makes her a "whore" and subject to death by stoning. So the film continually strikes a rare balance. It points out the adaptability and resourcefulness of children, whilst also pointing out their limitations, dependencies and fragility. Likewise, it denounces meddlesome foreign superpowers for the various dislocations they cause, as well as being critical of a certain backward, local tribalism.Of course like most of these art-house, "humanitarian" films, "Stray Dogs" is doomed never to find the audience it's desperately trying to target. In contrast to similar works by Italian and Japanese film-makers during the 40s, all of which were spawned by conquered, war torn countries, and all of which featured lowly heroes navigating the rubble infested, post war ruins of Italy or Japan, this new wave of post Iraq/Afghanistan war films falls upon few eyeballs. In the mainstream, Michael Winterbottom's "In This World" and "The Road to Guantanamo" forced westerners to live through the eyes of those at the end of their government's gun-sights, but few watched even Winterbottom's relatively crowd pleasing works.In contrast, European and Japanese cinema of the 1940s and early 50s, which tended to focus heavily on proletarians, peasants, homeless families and children, all of whom struggled to survive or climb out of the literal and economic rubble of World War 2 (and of course the droppings of the Atomic bombs), found no trouble finding audiences and critical praise. Indeed, these conflicts or traumas gave rise to a number of seminal films, such as "Germany, Year Zero", "Nettezza Urbana", "Bicycle Thieves", "La Terra Trema", "Stromboli", "Stray Dogs" and a slew of Japanese films I'm not and probably never will be familiar with. Which is not to say that Middle Eastern cinema, and Iranian cinema in particular, hasn't blossomed hugely in the past 2 decades, but that there's a sense that we're now simply getting the Middle Eastern versions of stories that more economically advanced countries already got out of their systems decades ago.8/10 Â<U+0096> Worth one viewing. 
tt0423277; I was traveling in the tram and came across a Dutch magazine. I do not know Dutch Â<U+0096> not to read or write or speak, but just to make myself familiar with the local magazine, I browsed through it. The magazine gave weekly events. At the end of the magazine Â<U+0096> it gives reviews of movies. I was attracted to a photograph of a poor small child and a dog running in the midst of desert. This image attracted me and I started trying to read the Dutch review and to some extend understood that it was an Iranian movie set in Afghanistan. The review ended by the words of the movie "The Bicycle Thieves". This interested me more.Amsterdam publishes once a week Â<U+0096> an English newspaper called "The Weekly". It is delivered at offices, hotels, some key newspaper stalls all around Amsterdam Â<U+0096> but because of limited circulation is exhausted within a day. I was able to get hold of this news weekly. It elaborately gives film reviews Â<U+0096> and after reading all the reviews, I came across the review of "The Stray Dogs". I read it, and came to know that it is a movie that is inspired from "The Bicycle Thieves". It is also an acclaimed movie and had won awards at various international festivals. I found out that it was only running in the evening shows at Museum Theatre in Vondelpark.I asked my colleague Mr.Andreas Hensel Â<U+0096> who was interested in neo-realistic movies like "The Bicycle Thieves", whether he was interested? He told me that he was, but was engaged for a couple of days. Thus I decided to go to see the movie alone.I was excited! I knew the movie was in Arabic with Dutch sub-titles Â<U+0096> but I was undeterred.There were only four people in the movie hall Â<U+0096> two females and two males.This movie as I mentioned earlier is inspired by "The Bicycle Thieves" and it is a tribute to the long lasting impact it has left on the movie making art. Even after more than 50 years Â<U+0096> it is so heartening to know that some good movies are inspired and made on neo-realistic cinema.Like "The Bicycle Thieves" the story has a simple story line.The story is set in Afghanistan Â<U+0096> during the Tabilan years. It starts with two children Â<U+0096> an elder boy and younger girl Â<U+0096> who are shown as rag-pickers Â<U+0096> rescuing a stray dog Â<U+0096> from chasing kids who want to torch the dog to fire in a cave hole. Immediately after the first scene one gets to know the huge cinematic backdrop the visuals are providing. Rough and sandy terrain of Afghanistan is brilliantly captured by the director.The mother of these children is imprisoned by the authorities (due to language constraint I could not understand why) and every evening these children get access to go into the prison to sleep with their mother. But due to change of policy Â<U+0096> the guards do not allow the children to go into the prison.The children try desperately to get access to go and meet and sleep with their mother Â<U+0096> they beg, cry, and even get angry and throw stones at the guard. But un-successful in all their attempts Â<U+0096> they try to steal something Â<U+0096> thinking that their stealing would lead them to being caught and land them up in the prison.In their quest we are exposed to the nearly tribal culture of male dominated aggressive Afghanistan culture. The dog fight scenes, the robbing of the cows head by the children, the stealing of vegetable bag of a lady etc. are pictured poignantly. One feels sorry for the boys Â<U+0096> because in all their attempts they are caught Â<U+0096> smacked a little and set off free.But the cruel culture of Afghanistan in the back-drop leaves the audience's stomach churning with disgust. This lead to one female audience leaving the movie hall in mid-way, giving away sighs of anguish on the incredible harsh images shown of Afghan cultural life.At one point of time, the children are inspired to see a movie "The Bicycle Thieves" and after seeing the movie the elder boy tries to steal a bicycle and is caught by the police. And at that time Â<U+0096> we as audience feel a sigh of relief Â<U+0096> that at last their mission is over. But not yet! The elder son is taken by the police to a different prison from where the mother is kept. The young child the girl is left on the miserable streets alone. The girl tries to chase the police van that carries her brother Â<U+0096> but she is too small and young to run and keep pace with the vehicle.The movie ends up with mother crying in one prison, her elder son crying to go back outside to take care of his sister and the young sister sitting outside the mother's prison alone.Like "The Bicycle Thieves" the movie ends in a realistic and pessimistic note Â<U+0096> leaving a lump in our throat, as if saying to us to change the ending Â<U+0096> to a happy ending.I was pleased to see this movie Â<U+0096> and that too in succession of "The Bicycle Thieves". Recommended! 
tt0423277; Scruffy little homeless urchins plus fluffy little lost dog = cuteness overload.And yet by 20 minutes in i didn't feel engaged. The direction was too withdrawn, drama too withheld, the narrative lacking compulsion or even much purpose.I guess I'm getting more resistant to Iranian films like this with wide-eyed and innocent cute kids. I can see the manipulation involved: pick street urchins up on location, they aren't going to act because they can't act, but you can model them on how to look sympathetically photogenic. The method of delivering script is feed each kid the line they have to say just before the camera is pointed at them, then splice together these separate takes of dialogue in the edit afterwards. This avoids the kids having to act with one another or react in close ups, you just train each kid to hold still the reaction shot you want. But these close ups get to look too (com) posed, repeating the same static expressions, because the kids aren't interiorising the feelings they're meant to be experiencing: they mimic pretty Â<U+0096> as in cute Â<U+0096> facades of sad or angry, rather than enact or dramatise them from within.So mostly you get scenes in which the dialogue being spoken looks disconnected and sounds disengaged. Which may be why i felt similarly disconnected and disengaged.Anyway, the little dog does lots of little barking on cue Â<U+0096> with about the same level of subtlety as these kids delivering their dialogue.I'm surprised how slight, even facile, i found this film considering how entranced I was by her (Marzieh Meshkini) first film The Day i Became a Woman. 
tt0423277; It is an overwhelming film. Haunting, almost. Almost like a real life documentary -- So realistic was the presentation. I have seen the movie at the OSIAN Film Festival in Delhi in 2005. Even after viewing other movies at this year's (2006) OSIAN Film festival this year I am longing to see this film again and again. A simple but socially so relevant film.Would like to get a VCD/DVD of this film. Where and how can I get it. Is a dependable online seller available? Can anyone guide me. I would even like to see other movies of this film maker. I stay in Delhi, India. 
tt0291202; While it might be too much to say that the Japanese film industry was in shambles by the late 1960s because of the popularity of television and Western films, it is indeed appropriate to say that it had fallen on hard times. Kurosawa and a number of his contemporaries were either no longer making films or, because their needed budgets were quite high, had their films produced in foreign countries. Even independent film directors such as Oshima Nagisa directed television documentaries in order to support their film endeavors? So what type of film dominated theater screens during the late sixties and the early seventies? Pink films, or soft core porn. While they were viewed as the lowest form of film art, they did draw (male) audiences and a few of the starlets from these films did in fact become quite recognizable.As for content, most of these films were quite vacuous and, of course, the aim of titillation was more important than plot or true innovativeness. Yet, there were some pink film directors such as Wakamatsu Koji who tried to add an artistic treatment to his pink films. With extraordinarily low budgets, say around one million yen per film which was valued then in the late sixties around five thousand dollars, which led to him using non top of the line pink film starlets, Wakamatsu created films that to some might seem philosophical and to others nothing more than porn with airs of something higher, but it should be noted that his film effort, Affairs Within Walls (1965) did receive acclaim from the judges at the Berlin Film Festival, but it also led to his being fired by Nikkatsu in 1965.In 1969 Wakamatsu directed ten films, including Go, Go, Second Time Virgin and the film I am about to review Violent Virgin or Gewalt! Gewalt: shojo geba-geba.Filmed entirely in a desolate field, Violent Virgin opens with two cars traveling along a dusty road. Three men and three women, apparently members of a gang, have a couple bound and blindfolded. After they reach their demonstration, they drag the man and woman, whose names we soon learn are Hoshi and Hanako, out of the cars and dump them on the ground. It seems that Hanako was the boss's girl, but she eloped with Hoshi. Captured, it seems that they are going to be murdered, but not before they are humiliated by the other gang members. Their clothes are eventually stripped off and Hanako is tied to a cross. Hoshi is informed that the big boss has ordered that he be made into the "boss" for the day. The male members of the gang refer to Hoshi as "boss" and each of the female members intend to have sex with him before he is killed. However, Hoshi strangles the first prostitute and runs. After this, things really begin to become bizarre.It would be too easy to call Violent Virgin a disturbing film. The quality of acting and the surreal setting of the setting keeps the viewer from being truly drawn into the film, but the film does touch on a number of issues that the viewer cannot help but ponder after the film, almost mercifully, comes to an end, such as the distinction between man and beast and how thin the wall separating the two might truly be. While I cannot recommend this film to the casual viewer of Japanese film, it might be an interesting film to view for those interested in Japanese New Wave films or those interested in a director who is often considered to be an outcast amongst outcasts. 
tt0291202; I sought this out after seeing a similar film by the same director from the same year. It was much more complex than this, though it shared many of the same elements: sexual violence and heavy if obvious metaphors. That movie seems to have been shot in only few days. I think this one must have taken longer. As you probably will not see it, and the description here is poor, I'll describe it.We are presented with a car full of four gangsters, and another of four prostitutes, apparently loosely attached to the gang. They have a bound couple they are taking to a desolate area to torture. She is to be placed nude on a cross. He is to have sex with the four women and then beaten to death with baseball bats. He murders the first prostitute and escapes nude but for her slip. He successfully escapes, leaving his wife on the cross. (We learn that the girl was "owned" by the gang boss but has left the gang and married this fellow.) He encounters a strange group a mile away, camped out. This is two more prostitutes, two male servants and a pampered boss. They take him in and there are several strange conversations. He ends up pulling a trigger that he later learns wounds his wife on the cross above her exposed breast.Enraged, he walks to the original group, and ends up killing everyone all around.That description leaves out the rather heavy religious symbolism, which actually is effective because it is Christian in a non-Christian context. And there is much made Â<U+0097> in lingering shots Â<U+0097> of who is watching who, using conventional new wave perspectives on folding. She is the great watcher, wounded as a result, still watching at the end.Two film stocks are used, black and white for what we see, or would if we were there, and color stock for what we see he sees (which is what she sees). Its actually quite intelligent in a Japanese Jess Franco sense.There is nudity of the kind that Japanese authorities allow. So although the wife is fully nude when put on the cross (and we see from behind), all the frontal shots have a pubic modesty cover. More bizarre is the husband who alternates between being fully nude when seen from behind, but clothed in the slip when seen from the front. I suppose contemporary Japanese audiences would ignore this and accept the lingering shots of her armpit hair and copious use of bats as substitutes.This is an odd thing, violent, blunt, lowbrow, full of unnecessary and exploitative breasts and simulated sex. And it has padded lingering shots and poor production values. Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching. But it somehow transcends itself. 
tt1111914; It is one of the best mordern type of malayalam movies. These masterpiece's are very few to see.It manages to capture comedy and sadness. Both. My opinion is that its the best movie of 2007.If you are looking for a light movie this movie is for you. Sreenevasan delivers a superb performance. Best acting i have seen in 2007. My favorite actor now.The other cast performs a superb performance also.Its mainly because of Sreenevasan this movie had the sparkle. No actor could have fit his role better. 
tt1111914; This movie came to my attenna when media started showing and talking that Tamil movie superstar Rajnikant is going to make his next movie based on a Malayalam movie. I found out its name Â<U+0096> Katha Parayumbhol. Waited for more than 6-7 months, ultimately today I got to see this movie.The story is set in a small village Melukavu in Kerala. A barber Balan (Sreenivasan) is poor with his wife Sredevi (Meena) and three children. He is not able to cope with modernization with a new air condition beauty salon / parlour opened by Sarasan (Jagadish) set up opposite his shop. He does not get license or a loan for the salon. He is in debt and ridiculed by everyone in the village. Life is tough for him Â<U+0096> he does not have money to pay children's school fee, nor knows how he is going to have his next meal for his family. There enters a Malayalam superstar Ashok Raj (Mammotty), who is going to come to the village for a ten day shoot. The whole village is excited in preparing their superstar's arrival. Slowly a word spreads that Balan and Ashok Raj are childhood friends. Balan, who was a laughing stock, becomes the center of attention. Everyone goes out of their way to help Balan in every way, so that they can get a favor when Ashok Raj arrives to the village. Balan is under pressure from everyone to part a favor of Ashok Raj. When Ashok Raj arrives, Balan tries his best to approach Ashok Raj Â<U+0096> but his honesty and status of barber, does not allow him to go pass through the police security. When the village people know that Balan is not able to help them for a favor, they start taking their support to Balan back, abusing him of cheating them. Balan depressed and sad is back to his old self. Ashok Raj gives a ceremonial speech at a school function where he talks about today's life, modernization, the state of good people etc. opening eyes of everyone to the sad truth of peoples behavior. In the end, Ashok Raj goes to meet Balan at his house, and Balan becomes an overnight hero in the eyes of his village people.Sreenivasan has written and scripted the movie and M.Mohanan has directed it. Sreenivasan has done a fantastic job in presenting common persons life - people's motivation and greeds. He plays about the simple barbar with panache. Mammotty as superstar carries an aura with grace and touches everyone's heart with his last speech. The other characters of the village are also well developed Â<U+0096> the bard, the politician, the money lender, the beauraucrat, the modern salon owner, the school principal etc.This is a very funny, poignant story of modernization and its impact on an ordinary person. I love to see good old Malayalam movies with its simplicity and village life. Now those movies are rare and few. I long for them. This movie fits my type of beautiful Malayalam movie that remains with you and touches your heart as no other form of cinema does.I hope Rajnikant draws a lot and builds on top of this movie Â<U+0096> especially on the message it communicate with simplicity and honesty.(Stars 7 out of 10) 
tt1111914; One of the enjoyments this vacation to Kerala was watching the movie Kadha Parayumbol. While Mammooty and Mukesh play only vignette appearances, the protagonist of the story is 'Balan the barber' played by Sreenivasan, the popular filmmaker and non-glamorous hero of Malayalam screen.The simple tale of a village barber's contention of friendship with the most sought after film star provides the thread for the story, which builds suspense, satire and sentiment to a touching climax.Kadha Parayumbol, a clean film that takes audience through the ebb and flow of tension, without a wee bit if sex or violence, is a challenge to the genre of the so called Malayalam 'formula film'.As storyteller, scriptwriter and lead actor Sreenivasan has proved once again that he has mastered the art of 2-hour storyboarding by fully exploiting the grammar of film language.This film is also Mukesh's maiden production venture in partnership with Sreenivasan.It is the must-see movie of the year 2007. Don't miss it if you can afford to see it at a movie theatre. I dare you, you wouldn't be able to walk out of the theatre without tearful eyes. Tears of joy I mean.Sujit

tt0273169;  I've read quite a few good reviews on this movie and I just can't understand why. Now I know foreign horror films tend to have some very bad acting. (which this one does)And they pride themselves on being very atmospheric. (one of the few plusses with this movie) But why must they be so damn disjointed. It's like the editting is performed by someone having seizures. The movie is all over the place and totally incoherent. Maybe it's just me but most Italian horror flics seem to have the same problems. They make little sense. I bought this movie on sale and I was still robbed! SPOILER: The model airplane death scene has to be one of the lamest deaths I've ever witnessed! The old lady ought to be put in a home though the son was good for a few chuckles. The only really intense scene was the nun being killed by the scissors. And the ending.... doesn't exist!! What the hell is this movie about??? Terrible movie... avoid at any and all costs!!! 
tt0273169;  DESECRATION, frankly, is a mess of a movie.  Lots of imagery that was intended to be disturbing, but it falls far short of the mark.  Badly acted with hamhanded lighting, clumsy cinematography and poor production design all add up to a very amateurish-looking film.  For example, I saw surprised to see the Kodak film logo on the end credits, as I was convinced the movie was shot on video, then given the Film Look process.Yes, the movie tries to weird you out by presenting "disturbing" images (none of which disturbed me), but since the story was lacking and what little bit there was, was confusing, there is no tension, no suspense, and  without those, disturbing images won't cut it.  You don't care about these people, and without empathy for your characters, all the disturbing imagery in the world isn't going to make a difference.This, as with Dante Tomaselli's second film HORROR, would have made perfect 7-minute student films. 
tt0273169; Tomaselli obviously has a flair for creating eye candy. Although a few of the effects in this film are hokey and ultra-low-budget (the model plane, the scissors), the majority of the visuals are fantastic Â<U+0096> reminiscent of many Euro-shockers and the first "Evil Dead." However, what the film lacks is a coherent story. I'm not a moviegoer who needs everything spelled out Â<U+0096> "Black Christmas," for example, was creepy because we barely see the killer, let alone find out his motivation. "Donnie Darko" remains an enigma even to the writer/director. "Burnt Offerings" leaves you to decide exactly what happened in the house. But at least the aforementioned have some sense of logic.The principle story here is about a boy who's dragged to Hell by his dead mother as she attempts to escape. Or so they say. However, nothing that happens within the film justifies that plot line Â<U+0096> and it all completely lacks logic. If Tomaselli had ended the film in the traditional Hollywood "it was all a dream" way, perhaps I could forgive the film for lacking sense. As is, it feels like an overlong student film.The acting is horrendous all around, with the exception of the boy who plays Bobby. The old lady (who can't act, but I've seen in a slew of films) is annoying and, unfortunately, has the dominant part. The few male actors all sound like they're reading off cue cards, and then there's the nuns Â<U+0096> but if you can't say something niceÂ .The DVD ends with an "excerpt from the original short film" on which this movie was based. I don't understand why it's not the complete film (the provided scene is exceptional) nor is there a commentary or any other extras. Enigmatic films such as this ALWAYS benefit from commentaries.Those seeking something out of the norm might enjoy this, as well as stoner horror buffs. All others, avoid it. 
tt0273169;  I stumbled across Desecration quite by accident, finding the cover artwork captivating.  The four paintings of a nun takes on a Lovecraftian feel and the viewer should get a good idea that the horror film contained inside will be more of a cerebral experience than a direct Hollywood one.  I liked that clue, because I was in a mindset to see something very different.  I wasn't disappointed!There are so many words that went through my mind watching this tale of a boy struggling to figure out what is happening around him at a catholic school and the accidental death of a nun: Unsettling, surreal, hallucinatory, atmospheric, disturbing, eerie....words that wound up being on the DVDs back cover in quotes and film summary! (I never read the summaries or critical quotes before a viewing so I can come up with my own idea of the film first) One thing is for sure, the viewer will be left with a deep sense of unease.  I found myself sitting back for a while, thinking some of the opening was a bit low budget (fog and mist tends to come from a specific point off camera), then part of the way through I was sitting up, then leaning forward by the end of the film, entranced.There are no direct answers to the story, as Bobby and even his grandmother find that they cannot do much about the supernatural goings-on since they are not sure what is real or not.  This is apparent as the grandmother asks a couple times "What do I do NOW?...." but the occurrences seem to throw her off every time.  Bobby can't tell if he is dreaming half the time and winds up running away, only to be faced at every turn by a nun that has the most creepy expression.  Be careful to take a good look at the nun who is accidentally killed in the film's opening...she seems to have an eerie resemblance to Bobby's dead mother. A scene where Bobby's father and grandmother pass the nun on a road really creeped me out!Writer/director Dante Tomaselli seemed to have a lot going on creatively for the film's story and visuals.  What the film may lack technically because of budget limitations it more than makes up for in ambition and style.  Much of the film could easily be made into stills that would hold up on their own as bizarre paintings--the sequence in which earth and plants take over Bobby's room seem to be inspired by Dali (who's name appears in the thank-you's in the end credits).  The use of clowns together with nuns as horrifying creatures is a wonderful blend.The creative process for Desecration is one I'd love to learn more about, as Tomaselli thanks people such as Marc Almond, Ric Ocasek, Laurie Anderson, Martin Gore, and Dario Argento in the credits.  One big mention in the opening credits is a "special thanks to Alfred Sole," director of Alice, Sweet Alice (aka Communion).  After watching Desecration I was hungry to find out how these artists influenced Tomaselli.This is definitely not an easy film to experience.  The story keeps jumping from one weird scene to another and the ending just APPEARS right when you think something might happen to explain more.  All I can gather is that when someone wants to get out of Hell that person will do practically anything! This is not standard horror fare for people looking for cheap and fast thrills, it's a psychological challenge and worth the 88-minute hold it will have on you! 
tt0273169; anyone who got stuck in and suppressed in Catholic or boarding school will squirm at this.. while I wish he got a decent/bigger budget for the film, the director makes some interesting points about the dangers of repression, the equally liberating and damning aspects of religion, (it's about the dark side of religion, while not really an all-out slam on Catholicism) and how abuse comes back to (literally) haunt oneself. The sound is awesome, this could really use a soundtrack, much better than general indie scores. Is that all Jersey woods? Vincent Lamberti is creepy as a priest with too many secrets, and those who want clearcut answers to their basic stories may be disappointed. But it's got a neat dream-logic that will either make you nervous or just baffle you. 
tt0273169;  Firstly let me say that I am an avid Horror Fan. I collect and love lots of different horror movies from the Italian gore to the more psychological to the plain funny as in Evil Dead. Now, Desecration. What category does this fall into? It maybe has its own unique category. If so, It would be close to the bottom of the pile...where movies you will only ever watch once and still regret doing so, live. To describe the general gist of this movie is quite simple. forget unbelievable surrealism, forget cerebral and beautiful haunting imagery. Try 'a collection of stereotypical horror movie clichA©s that are thrown together without ANY real sense of structure, meaning and above all no message and no story is forthcoming'.Even some of these people here praising the movie have admitted it seemed to be going nowhere at times or didn't make any sense. Of the other reviews there is one that stands out and praises this movie as if it is the best movie ever made.... It isn't hard to guess that the reviewer is a keen user of cannabis-Deduced by the nickname, If I am wrong shoot me! - and if I were to view this movie under the influence, I too would probably say 'Wow' 'amazing' 'freaky' etc etc etc. In the grim harshness of reality though (!?), this movie is a total TURKEY. If you are considering buying this trash...be warned, there are better things to spend your money on. Like a new Can opener or something. If you want a cheap alternative to this movie, get a collection of older movie trailers, put them on back to back so it lasts an hour or so, then sit and watch it whilst flicking different coloured lights on and off now and then with some old led Zep or pink floyd music on in the background- playing backwards of course. 0 out of 10 
tt0273169; Title: Desecration (1999) Director: Dante Tomaselli Cast: Danny Lopes, Christie Sanford, Irma St. Paule, Vincent Lamberti Review: This was Dante Tomasellis first directorial effort. And like many directors on their first film, they either show some promise and go on to become great directors...or they fall flat on their ass and disappear into oblivion. I'm thinking that Tomasellis one of the promising ones.The story is about a 15 year old kid called Bobby Rullo who is played by Danny Lopes in his first starring role. He is assisting St. Anthonys Catholic School and one day as he is playing with his remote controlled air plane, he kills a nun by accident. Bobby didn't know it, but the nun he killed was an evil nun even in life. And when she was killed by Bobbys remote controlled airplane, she went straight to deepest bowels of hell. Now she wants out, and she intends to use Bobby to do it.Thats the basic plot of the film. The film does go into surreal dreamlike territory so be ready for a film that doesn't necessarily spell things out for you. Like Bobbys grandmother mentions at one point in the film "its a puzzle!" Though I don't think it was as hard to grasp as some people say.I'm a big fan of supernatural horror movies and it seems that this is just the type of horror film that Tomaselli is specializing in making. I had already seen his second film HORROR and loved it. It was heavy on its supernatural themes as well, so I dug it lots. So I just knew that I had to see his previous film. I was expecting Desecration to maybe be a little less good since it was his first film, but boy was I wrong. Desecration was fantastic! Let me go on detailing why.Tomaselli is obviously a very visual director. He is keen to showing striking nightmarish images that will stick in your mind long after you've seen the movie. There's many instances like that in Desecration. The nun who terrorizes Bobby and his grandmother all through out the film is one striking image all on its own. She appears quite a few times in the movie, sometimes faceless, sometimes extremely demonic....she gave me the willies. One particular image of her coming in through the gates of St. Anthonys Catholic school was very very spooky. So be on the look out for that.There's one moment that has to go down in the horror books for all eternity and its the scene with the flying scissors killing the nun. I freaking loved that scene! Things flying in the air all by themselves give me the hibby jibbies...so these flying scissors really did it for me. There's many more memorable sequences like that all through out the film.Now, keep in mind that this is in fact a low budget flick (budget was around the vicinity of $150,000) so don't be expecting a big Hollywood film. This is a low budget flick that shows that you don't need kajillions of dollars to make a good flick. In fact I enjoyed Desecration more then any of the crap coming out in theaters recently (Boogyman and Darkness Falls I'm looking at you!) It may have some limitations on money...but not on creativity.Speaking of creativity, my hats down to Tomaselli for making the score and sound effects so creepy. Like Carpenter, Tomaselli scores his own films. And its pretty obvious he pays much attention to this part of the filmaking process. I loved all the different sound effects all through out the film. The crying babies, the scary maniacal laughter, the wind blowing...just little details that add a whole lot of atmosphere and horror to the proceedings.The only thing I didn't like was the abrupt ending. It just suddenly ends...and your left feeling like WHAT? Thats it? I guess I really didn't want the movie to finish since I was enjoying it so much, but I guess Tomaselli opted to go with a Argento/Fulci ending, where you are left with a big question mark in your head...clever way to make you think about the movie after its finished now that I think about it.Also the sequence where the nun gets hit by a plane, in my opinion could have been pulled off slightly better. It didn't feel authentic. In my opinion that sequence was meant to be the first big shock in the film, but it turns out a bit funny instead because it didn't look like thats the way it would have happened in real life. But thats just a minor imperfection in an other wise great film.I'm a big fan of independent horror cinema. Why? Cause it shows all you really need is imagination, creativity and drive to make something special. And its obvious that Dante Tomaselli has plenty of those traits. Tomaselli demonstrated with Desecration and Horror that he is more then capable of making some damn fine horror films, and I got a feeling that as time goes by and Tomasellis recognition as a horror director grows his films will only get better and better. I'm really looking forward to his newest flick being released soon by Anchor Bay Entertainment called "Satans Playground".Rating: 4 out of 5 P.S. I really wished that this DVD had a audio commentary with Tomasellis insights on the making of it. Half of the enjoyment of watching HORROR was Tomasellis comments on what went on behind the scenes. Too bad there is no audio commentary on this DVD version of Desecration. Maybe on a future version? 
tt0273169;  Very strange imagery is used throughout this film, the scenes with ghostly nuns and clowns will disturb a lot of viewers. It reminded me of a low-budget version of Dario Argento's Suspiria, and the writer/producer/director thanks Argento in the end credits so it most likely was influenced by that 70's horror classic.I wasn't very into the film in it's first twenty minutes or so, i found it really slow and it didn't seem that the story was truly going anywhere. The rest of the film takes off and becomes more bizarre with each passing minute. The unique camera angles and techniques are quite effective and add a little more than usual to this low-budget film. Just don't go into it expecting a large budget horror flick, otherwise you'll be disappointed.The acting is a mixed bag, some of the actors did a really good job. However, some had flat performances but this didn't really take away from the overall experience.I wouldn't say this movie really creeped me out personally (very few horror films do and i do love the genre). It does contain a very dark and brooding atmosphere throughout, plus the dark music score is quite well done. The film also leaves you thinking about what the story truly means, long after the movie has ended.Definitely above average for a horror film and i would give it a rating of 8 out of 10. 
tt0273169;  Dante Tomaselli's first movie, Desecration, is far from perfect: the acting and dialogue is terrible, the story is vague, there are some silly ideas, and there's a cheap look to some of it.However, in terms of atmosphere and imagery and outright fear, it's a winner. It took me a little while to get into it, but once I was it had an almost unbearable creep-out factor. If Tomaselli had abandoned the story altogether and made a totally abstract piece of surrealism, it might have been a total success. As it is, it's still one of the scariest horror movies of the last few years.I can't wait to see Tomaselli's second movie, Horror. He has the potential to become the most exciting young horror filmmaker around. If he can adapt his style to fit a more mainstream storytelling sense he may become huge. If he descends further into surrealism he'll almost certainly end up a cult favourite. Either way, he seems to be someone with a unique and compelling vision, which horror has been missing for too long. Bravo! 
tt0273169; Debut film from Dante Tomaselli gives us a nice little campy atmospheric horror film but other than that there's not much to say about this film. It's good, but not great. There are some very creepy standout scenes that stick in your mind for awhile, but there's nothing really special about this film that would make me rave about it. The negative reviews say that Desecration is lousy and very bad well I've seen a lot worse so don't be discouraged out of seeing this film it's still a decent effort by a then rookie director. Horror buffs out there that like hypnotic creepy horror films that make no sense like this should be/will be pleased with the effort. 6/10 
tt0215850;  Michel Jette has given us an unsettling glimpse at what organized crime is really like.  Set in one of the somewhat less lavish neighborhood of Montreal, Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, the movie explores the struggles of teenagers who are irreversibly drawn into a world of crime, deadly loyalty and power struggle.  Realistic and well-acted, the simple premise of the movie lets the storyline creep up slowly with occasional twists and turns, but the social commentary it gives is confusingly subtle and thought-provocative even in its apparent directness.  While less extravagant than Soderberg's Traffic, it's realism and attempted objectivity at the attractive, yet morally questionable, social and economic underworld is a quality that will give this film a long-lasting effect to most avid viewers. When it ends, you will still have plenty to think about.Try to get your hands on this one.  Probably the best French-Canadian film in years. 9/10 
tt0215850; This is a movie about th biker war in Quebec, in which a few hundred persons died, including a lot of innocent ones.The first time I watched this movie, I did like it but only because of the theme, the criminal bikers. The second time I watched it, a couple years later, all the symbols and the "hidden messages" about the faith of the main characters were just too clear.Yes, there is overacting by the main character, but I think it was intended that way. He looks innocent, not the non-guilty kind of innocent, but rather, as Mr Pierre Foglia used in one of his chronicles about a different topic, innocent as the rabbit looking at the headlights of the truck that is about to crush him.This movie was, in my opinion, intended to discourage people from ever joining a criminal organization such as those portrayed in the story, by demonstrating that the only possible end, or escape, is death. 
tt0215850; In Quebec, the smalltime criminal Marc (Dominic Darceuil) is surprisingly invited to join the Dark Souls, a powerful biker gang leaded by Tatou (Deano Clavet) that is in war against the Devil's Soldier. Marc gets close to his sponsor and begins his initiation process in the gang, hijacking a motorcycle on the road and break-in a house to steal another one. While his best friend Nose (Jean-Nicolas Verreault ) aims to join the Darks, Marc participates in murders of opponents and begins to feel uncomfortable with his new friends. After his last mission, he finds the truth about the Darks."Hochelaga" is actually a pointless presentation of the world of criminal gangs of bikers through the eyes and feelings of Marc. Whether intentional or not, this lead character shows an absolute lack of personality and it is impossible to feel empathy for any character of this below average movie. I was completely misled by the overrated IMDb Rating. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): "Hochelaga Â<U+0096> Gangues Sangrentas" ("Hochelaga Â<U+0096> Bloody Gangs") 
tt0215850;  I have to admit that this is the first French-Canadian film I have seen and I came away very disappointed.. Jette took a rich and promising subject and unfortunately didnt do it justice..It comes off as an attempted semi-documentary but seems more as a stereotypical caricature of biker clubs.. The supporting roles arent fleshed out very well and the main protagonist Marc, lost my empathy very quickly.. I would have loved to see a deeper look at the relationship between Marc, Nose and Bof and also between Marc and Popeye, which is more of a filler than a contribution to the actions of Marc.. The cast seems to be competent enough, but unfortunately, an average script has let them down.. Watch this movie only if you are really into bikers or if like me, you are curious to see the difference in the accents between the French and the French-Canadians... 
tt0027307; This is a simple premise about a bus driver dubbed Mr. Thank You because he always thanks people when they move to the side of the road to let him pass. Everyone he knows likes him and many say thank you back. This story is mainly about the people who get on the bus headed to a train. One is a mother and daughter, the mother only going so far to say goodbye to her daughter who is presumably being sold (this was the Great Depression, when things like that happened). There is a mix of people on the bus with different reasons for being there and they forge a relationship one might have if they were all going on a bus tour. You see some of the countryside of Japan, some of which is pretty even in black and white. It was a grim time for the world then and this film, while having a bit of light comedy, also has some sadness. As the film went on, I was more interested. Mr. Shimizu, as far as I'm concerned, can be mentioned in the same breath of the titans of Japanese film, like Kurosawa, Ozu, Mizoguchi and Naruse, as well as others. If you're interested in Japanese film, you owe it to yourself to buy the box set that has this film, which was just received domestically. Mr. Shimizu was very adept at capturing everyday people as they were living their lives. This is a triumph. 
tt0027307; Like Sadao Yamanaka and Mikio Naruse, Hiroshi Shimizu is one of the major Japanese directors whose work has been overshadowed in the West by the popularity of Mizoguchi, Ozu, and Kurosawa, even though his films are every bit as good as theirs. Whereas Naruse's reputation has benefited in recent years from several DVD releases in the U.S. and U.K., however, Shimizu's films are still relatively hard to track down. The release of four of his films by Criterion's Eclipse label helps, but at least four more films have already been released on DVD in Japan and deserve distribution in the West."Mr. Thank-You," as this film is known in the West, is a perfect introduction to Shimizu's work. Like Ozu's films, it is bittersweet in tone, though with perhaps a little more emphasis placed on humor than on pathos. But Shimizu's camera is far more mobile than Ozu's, so stylistically, it has a bit more in common with Naruse. The other two reviewers have already summarized what little plot there is: the film is basically a "road" movie, in which an assortment of middle-class and working-class characters travel from a rural community to Tokyo. As the film progresses, each character's personality reveals itself, and a small, short-lived sense of community develops. Whether or not that sense of community will continue after the film ends (due to a budding romance between the bus driver and a young female passenger who is being sold into prostitution because of family debt) is pretty much the only source of suspense or plot. Nevertheless, as a slice of life, "Mr. Thank-You" is nothing short of magnificent. Shimizu's humanism is evident in every frame of the film, with each character, including the bit parts, emerging as three-dimensional people with very real concerns and aspirations. This is a film you watch for the character development and for the loving treatment the director, writer, and actors give them.As a side-note, Shimizu's importance as a voice of dissent during Japan's militarization and as a link between pre- and post-war Japanese cinema is apparent in the short interlude between the bus driver and a female laborer he offers to give a free lift. The female laborer is Korean, and Koreans were perhaps the most marginalized people in 1930s Japan -- their country having been colonized by Japan and their people reduced to ill-paid, migratory labor. Giving such sweet and tender treatment to this character's plight gives some indication of Shimizu's true feelings toward Japan's imperial expansion and reveals that there's a lot more going on in this film than might first seem. 
tt0027307; Nice little Japanese comedy. Mr. Thank You is a bus driver who often brings people from the country to Tokyo. As he drives along the narrow dirt roads, he profusely thanks the farmers and such who move to the side as he passes them. At one village, he picks up a 17 year old girl and her mother. The girl is being transported to Tokyo, where her mother will sell her into prostitution. It's the Great Depression, and the family can no longer afford to support her. Over the course of the trip, Mr. Thank You becomes more and more aware of the girl's sad face. The rest of the bus chat amongst themselves, drink, smoke, whatever. The film runs about 80 minutes, and, honestly, is pretty slight. The titular character and the young girl are rather dull people. A couple of the other passengers are more interesting, but they also are generic types of people (e.g., modern woman or stuffy businessman). It's funny much of the time, and well filmed. I like seeing the Japanese countryside and its people. Japanese films of every era focus way too much on just Tokyo that it's easy to forget the rest of the country. 
tt0409937; "Espace dA©tente" is a good way to conclude the TV show "Camera CafA©", I say it to make it clear : the directing is awful, the cut is terrible, But......we like them so much, for the first time we can follow them outside that little coffee room, so even if i's really badly directed, it's fun to see Jean Claude, HervA© and the others in all the situations that we had just tried to imagine before, the family of JC, his car, the office toilets (funnyest scene of the movie).There's also many running gag, as the dog sequence who remain the dog of "There's something about Mary", not bad ! The plot is also a (light) pamphlet about economic and social problems. So, just the TV show fans will like it, and I am ! 
tt0081672;  this 1980's finnish youth film aims to explain the parents what their young are doing and more importantly, why are the doing it.the film has a good attitude, that is credible within youth even today, it doesn't try to push the bible in your face so to speak, on the contrary, it attempts, and succeeds to show what happens when the parents are thinking only of themselves and forget they have a family to run. naturally, even this approach has some critics. it's not necessary for a kid to have bad family conditions to become a 'hooligan'.in any case, it's a good movie. the directing works, the description of the punk generation youth is quite believable, they act though and talk about drinking and getting laid but their attempts at it are mostly pathetic, and when someone acts threatenly towards them they either run or freeze. and it isn't a cheery teen movie ala american pie, this one makes you think, especially if you've had difficulties understanding rebelling teens.the only thing the film really suffers from is the somewhat bad acting. obviously, real school kids were used as extras, and they look too excited about what's going on...but the real actors don't really succeed either. some special interest may be kati outinen's first acting job. the director keeps it all together, though, and some of the camera work is exceptional for a finnish film of this nature.recommended. 
tt0081672; Jussi (Esa NiemelA¤) is a student on a special class for problematic youths in a school in East Helsinki during the punk rock era of the late 1970s. Many of his classmates come from broken homes and display different signs of rebellion against various authority figures, something that is only understood by their kind teacher "Pappa" (Pertti V. Reponen). After getting in trouble with the school once again, Jussi runs away from his home and spends days wandering around the town, with or without his classmates Pete and Lissu (Tony HolmstrA¶m and Kati Outinen). Can there be a sensible solution for his desperate escape?The film mainly utilizes a non-flashy documentary-like approach to its troubled characters. The rawness is effectively emphasized by beginning the film with footage of an authentic childbirth ("Life, here I come" indeed!) and a punk rock concert of Pelle Miljoona that sets the mood for the story excellently. True to the realistic style, the characters are not portrayed as badass street punks, most of the time they don't talk very much and often just run away when confronted, but the atmospheric style has its problems too. Since the young actors were all amateurs, they often cannot carry the quiet scenes with their charisma or screen presence only, and we are not left with much to enjoy during the long wandering sequences like Jussi and Pete's drunken night out. Occasionally the film catches a fleeting feel of fragility beautifully though, such as when Jussi sadly crawls under a playground slide to sleep. The best one of the young actors is clearly Kati Outinen who has later appeared in many Aki KaurismA¤ki films, but Esa NiemelA¤ as the protagonist Jussi also succeeds decently in his first of only two credited acting jobs. None of the adult actors give any reasons to complain either.Personally I think very fondly of the setting in East Helsinki since I was born and raised there and recognize many of the locations seen in the film, but even when observed from a more objective point of view, the gray infrastructure suits the overall style very neatly. Contrasting with the bleak suburb, the other main setting of the story is the city center with its colourful lights and busy streets. Especially the dramatic climax on the wet, gleaming streets and the ledge of the City-Center building (a.k.a. "Makkaratalo") looks very good and ends the tale of modern anxiety powerfully.I absolutely loved TA¤A¤ltA¤ tullaan, elA¤mA¤! when I first saw it, but after several rewatches I've noticed that it doesn't quite hold up as strongly as I first thought it would. Some tightening of the pacing and better supporting actors could have helped the whole, but there's plenty to like in the film as it is now too. The apathetic atmosphere, lack of interest from the parents and the innocent relationship of Jussi and Lissu ring true, and the visuals are in tune with the story, so ultimately the film is a fairly enjoyable effort and well worth checking out at least once. 
tt0081672; This movie brings me some frightening childhood memories. This was the reality I was growing up in and it explains why I never went to the toilet at school. Watching this I became also relieved because I got an insight into the problems the bigger guys had and I now understand that much of my fears were exaggerated.I am sorry, and I am well aware that this movie is not about me but "TA¤A¤ltA¤ tullaan, elA¤mA¤" is a trip to my personal Stone Age, the early eighties when all the bullies at school relieved their frustrations by listening to punk rock and smashing some things into pieces. I didn't understand anything about that young anarchy back then but this movie gave me a valuable insight.The concept of the movie is the most ordinary one: a young boy discovering life's mysteries by learning by trial and error. Nothing surprising but it is interesting because it is about life. There are however some stereotypic characters, like the over-dominant school principal, but the special class teacher character seem to have some other level too than the teacher's one.The boy who lead the main role hardly ever appeared in any other film, and he actually does very little acting in this too. He's just quiet for the most of the time. The fans of Kati Outinen get to spot her as the girl of the story. 
tt0081672; As a Finnish and Helsinki citizen I find this movie to be one of the best Finnish movies ever. I'd label it as "Finnish Neo-realism" if there ever was such a genre, because it represents the early-80s Helsinki in such a realistic way that it is almost part documentary. I was a kid in Helsinki those days, and I remember my city like it was in the picture. Cold, hostile and full of concrete:)I like the way this movie is shot, it's not trying to be cool or "right" looking all the time. I guess Tapio Suominen worked with a minimum crew on the streets of Helsinki. Partly due to fact that Finnish cinema was going downhills fast (or was already in the bottom) and there was no money to spend around, but also because it worked well with the DIY-punk attitude of movie and the look. I love the way this movie looks. It looks very much like the early 80s were in Finland, sort of DDR-grey, dull and pale.I just LOVE the way the characters speak in this movie, how they act and behave. I'm not sure what "tarkkailuluokka" is in English (sort of special class for disturbed and antisocial youth, who can't cope with normal classes in school), but like the attitude was in those days and in this movie, the kids who were in "tarkkailuluokka" were thought to be destined for criminal / jail career. The kids in this movie are very much like those in my youth. Of course there are reasons for this behavior, kids' parents drinking, not being there for the kid etc. Problems that are universal. It's a story of a young soul, who eventually will be killed in the process, because there is no place for dreamers.Director KaurismA¤ki found his trusted actress Kati Outinen from this movie, in her first major movie role, and she was as wonderful as ever. 
tt0081672; i was born in the 1980 and i saw this movie in 2007 and i hit me deep.all those suburbia scenery and and great music.This is one of the best finnish movies for me.Tapio Suominen is a great director and seeing all that scenery and also good acting from the lead actors made me feel like i was a teenager in 1980 finland.Especially the school scenery and general photography was well done. Jussi sleeping in the playground with the knife was very touching.i recommend this movie for all finns who grew up in Helsinki in the past decades. 
tt0081672; I assume this one was a significant breakthrough for the Finnish cinematography and probably one of the first ones that created a base that later developed into dozens of films about life that are nowadays called "European Art-house". It's very interesting to think about how movies like that could affect society at that time-late 70's, early 80's...first of all, the excitement is to watch it from the historical point of view. So, not to speak about the plot itself again, I'd like to focus on thoughts that seemed the most interesting to me after I watched this one. The characters may seem very typical and director's look at the problem is probably too naive for modern audience. We've got "bad guy"-character from Pink Floyd's The Wall actually, a good guy who tries to save teenagers' lives and the bunch of kids whose lives are going from nowhere to nowhere. This film could be called icon for punk generation and if I was 15 now, it would be my favorite movie probably. But another association that stops me from talking about "lost generation" is that teenagers in the movie remind me too much of "Clockwork Orange" that contains one of the most repulsive stories in the history of cinema/modern literature. In the end it leaves me with the same feeling that the story of Burgess gives-both of the sides are wrong. The society machine that stands against freedom and rock music is terrifying but still the opposite side also doesn't bring any positive feelings. Self-destruction, crimes and total lack of morale isn't something you'd like your kid to have. Still it leads to the idea that parents and society are guilty, and they sure do, but not necessarily it always affects the victims of that attitude so harsh. They can stay human anyway. What I'm trying to say is that the film shows some positive sides of teenage characters but still I don't feel sorry for them. Well, anyway it doesn't cancel the fact that the problem of generations is eternal and we have to think and talk about it. Especially it was necessary in revolutionary times like 70's. So I was pretty happy to watch this movie that may not be very shocking and doesn't open many new horizons for the modern viewer but gives themes for thoughts and discussion. 
tt0819906; I just saw this very funny road movie premiered in Hungary. I try to summarize it without any spoilers. There's an old couple, the man is 81, the woman 70, and they live in the post-communist Hungary like hundreds of thousand other pensioners do: in very modest circumstances to put it mildly. They are unable to pay their bills and threatened by the utility suppliers. One day the old man gets fed up and robs a post office with his 1958 GAZ, the one-time luxury car of communist party leaders. The old couple flees to the country-side from the police chasing them. There is a young couple of police officers, the woman being the boss of the man. They are assigned to the case. The movie is partly about the differences between (very) old-age couples and young couples today. In summary, it is a very likable comedy, a road movie understandable to any audience outside Hungary as well. 
tt0819906; Excellent cast, excellent performance, excellent in every way possible.It is the best movie that I have seem in a long time.A nice way to send a message about the problems that most retires face when the retire.Very funny about the stupidity of the police. One more thing, the woman was smarter than the two men. Bravo !!!And the very unexpected end, was great !.Since I saw the movie I have been telling everybody to go see.I enjoy it tremendously. It is probably the Best movie at the festival. I hope that it wins !! 
tt1591622; Daniel Grou is a French Canadian director (mostly TV) in 2010 At Sundance film festival he came with shocking horror thriller genre movie 7 Days (horror fans must see) ... now brings disturbing and a bit provoking drama 10 1/2 10 1/2 is about problematic boy named Tommy. Tommy is a foster child who has developed violent behavior he lands under social worker Gilles SA©guin (played by Claude Legault) care in some kind of children's home.Hes angry, hes aggressive hes indecent. Day by day living on the edge, struggle through even craziest world.highly recommended. unique movie, brilliantly acting 
tt1591622; This movie is perhaps more education than entertainment. It is not an easy movie to watch because of the subject matter. Those who have been psychologically abused by parents may find themselves too easily drawn in and identifying with the plight of the young lead. Those who have not, may find it hard to believe that such thing happen, or shocked at how devastatingly the dysfunctions of the parents can become magnified in vulnerable children. Young Tommy is the victim of an upbringing heavily seasoned with drug abuse, neglect, psychological abuse and mental illness. Easy access to porn videos entices him to recruit a younger boy into a sexual experiment he's still too young to understand and this ends up with his being brutally beaten by his victim's older brother. This lands Tommy in a high-security youth treatment centre -- with an incredibly hard defensive shell for the social workers to crack.The combination of acting and directing is chillingly superb, making it easy to forget one is watching a performance an not a documentary. Everyone from the young lead to the supporting adult actors give amazing performances. The tantrums and the scenes of confinement are difficult to watch, but one cannot turn away. The ending is superbly executed -- leaving you wanting more, yet also content that a good path has been started. This is a movie that hopefully will have a lasting bittersweet impact on most viewers. 
tt1591622; I work in the field, and have seen almost every dysfunctional, antisocial, nasty behavior shown here in the last month. And the children look so innocent! This film is based in French-Canadian part of Canada, and that surprised me as I've seen a limited number in French, Bach and Broccoli, Leolo, C'est pas moi mostly dealing with disturbed children. The story is predictable in outline, but breathtaking in the presentation. The kid is in the system, but you don't know for sure if it's nature or nurture. Just like in real life it's usually a combination of both, kids with attention and impulse control problems have a higher incidence of getting beaten by parents who had the same problems and were beaten themselves. Kids with mood disorders can be AWOL and raise hell one day, and be depressed and suicidal the next. Medication can help if done correctly, but with children it is tricky and sometimes does more harm than good. The psychiatrist in this film was poor. The building was poor. The supervision was awful. The Social Worker's only clue was to try and establish a positive relationship with the kid, and was at least helpful. While not an overly optimistic view of childcare it's at least realistic, and shows the limitations of we mere mortals. The two leads were more than adequate, and occasionally brilliant. This film should be required watching for anyone seeking employment with disturbed children. 
tt1591622; This film is not entertainment, it is education. it tackles a very difficult subject in a detached, non-judgemental way, and the director achieves the feel of a fly on the wall documentary, which is exactly right for the tone of the piece. A small boy called Tommy does something dreadful to a smaller boy at the beginning of the film, and the film follows Tommy (Robert Naylor), who is already known to social services, in the aftermath. Tommy's story is told through flashbacks, and through the research his newly assigned Educator (Keyworker), Gilles (played by Claude Legault) does. The acting is superb, and the subject matter so well researched that the complexity of Tommy leaves you torn between hating him for what he did, and wanting to hug him and tell him everything is going to be OK. There are other characters, but they mostly serve as plot tools. Some of the scenes are extremely harrowing, but taken in context, you will see that they are necessary to the story. 
tt1429430; I love Rebecca Dautremer's drawings. It is especially the drawings that make this film worth watching. The story is fine too. It is about a boy who can't read, but whose aunt always read him stories. When the aunt dies, he inherits her library. Then, the stories come to life and he has to fulfill a quest. If you want to see all those characters, like Alice and the white rabbit, Peter Pan, Sleeping Beauty, giants and witches, in a style different from Disney's, then I recommend you watch this movie. My kids loved it too. They watched it nothing short of three times and were unhappy that I had to bring it back to the video rental store. 
tt1429430; This was such an enjoyable animated film, with a very a nice story and a pleasant visual style.Even when the story could seem to be a bit simple at first sight, it actually has many wonderful qualities, that made it charming and captivating.I think that now more than ever is a good thing to teach the kids about the marvels of reading and imagination, and about the importance of the stories to be preserves by future generations. In that aspect, this movie did an incredible work, being much better done and more honest that many other movies with a similar message.It is also a very entertaining fantasy flick, with many interesting characters and a good balance of humor and adventure, not to mention the very pleasant visual style that this movie had, making it a nice and delightful animated film for the whole family with lots of heart.I highly recommend it. 
tt1429430; I viewed this film with my 9-yr old daughter as part of the 2012 DC Filmfest. We both loved it for its heartwarming story and the outstanding animation. Originally made in French, the version which we saw is entirely in English with no subtitles. Through the generosity of Aunt Eleanor, Nat is introduced to many of the characters of classic literature, such as Alice (of Wonderland), the White Rabbit, Pinocchio, Red Riding Hood, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Peter Pan, and the Little Match Girl. His vivid imagination makes up for being very slow to learn how to read, about which his older sister teases him without mercy. The setting on the beach allows the adventurers to encounter some creatures who add to the suspense as time is running out to save the day. We highly recommend this to be seen with your family. 
tt1429430; 80 minutes short French animated feature movie. The story of a six year old boy who involved in saving the tiny magical creatures. A similar kind of movie to 'Le Tableau'. After all, this was the first movie to release. I have not seen a single European animation since last few months, so decided to go with it and I had a nice time. Firstly, I thought it was a children's movie, yes it was and as a grown up I was not annoyed instead enjoyed it like a kid.A young boy called Nat, for him reading is a complicated issue. He always gets teased by his elder sister. On one summer his family decides to relocating to their ancestral house in a small town. He and his sisters remembers their grandmother who tells children's stories during visits to see her. After her death, they come to know that she left some gifts for them. Financially suffering his family decides to get rid of old things from the house. Nat mistakenly discovers the tiny creatures who need his help to save their existence. So the boy's quest begins to do something for others. The beautiful adventures are portrayed in the remains.''Just because it was invented doesn't mean it isn't real''Technically, it sounds great. The animation was very good and the characters were so cute. The story was not bad, but a little crawl in the adventure section. As it was a short movie, you won't get any frustration. A short and lovely movie for family and kids. If 'The Avengers' is for adults, then this movie is for kids. All the famous characters from kids stories came together for this. Sadly, everyone had less time to spare to show their existence in the movie, but I expected a lot more. All in all it is still a nice movie to have. If any parents reading my this review kindly show it to your kids as well.7.5/10 
tt0299135; Excellent film about misogynist Maxwell Bright (Patrick Warburton) who, fed up with his dating history with American women, decides to get a mail order bride from China. Things go well for him at first as she appears as subservient as advertised, but when he embarrasses her (and himself) in front of his friends at a poker night, he finds that she is much more than just a prim and proper housewife. In fact, the gifts she has may even lead this unlikeable jerk to redemption.Warburton gets to bust out of his usual monotonous character trappings and shows some serious depth and rage. The changes seen in Maxwell Bright are neither smooth nor immediate. He has a tendency to lash out verbally at any female in the vicinity, and his tirades are alternatively LOL funny and cringe-worthy for their cruelty. Marie Matiko plays the beautiful Mai Ling, Max's bride, with equal amounts dignity and strength. When Max finally makes his turn for the "better", the lessons learned are never preachy, and the story doesn't turn sentimental. Religion is dealt with in a mature manner that is a departure from most movies I've seen that have tread in that area. David Beaird's screenplay treats its characters and the audience with respect.I went into this film thinking it was just going to be a cute little romantic comedy or fish-out-of-water story, but the plot twists taken are brave and eventually much more satisfying. This is not light-hearted fare. It's worthy of a wider release. 
tt0299135; Maxwell Bright hates women, but he hates himself even more. He destroys his business, his credit rating, his home and his friendships. Even his body falls apart, seemingly under the great cosmic weight of his hatred. And yet: this movie isn't about loathing, it's about forgiving. Yes, Maxwell is repulsive. But he holds a paradigmatic, redemptive trump card: somebody loves him. If Mai Ling can forgive him, honor him, love him -- then so can we. And ultimately, so can Maxwell himself -- which is precisely what sets him free. I enjoyed the naked shakiness of this movie. Performances by Patrick Warburton, Marie Matiko and Eric Roberts were especially textured and compelling. See this movie. It will test your powers of forgiveness, and you'll be better for it. 
tt0299135; The film starts off with a disclaimer stating that a true Buddist would sacrifice to live their life in hell so that another would be spared the same fate. This is followed by an opening scene that could have been taken from COPS or a really bad porno flick. It quickly emerges that Maxwell is a profane, mentally unstable misogynist who makes his living hawking TV's on TV in Southern California. His collection of pitiful friends and his materialist lifestyle are even more pathetic than his abominable anger at everything and everyone. For the first two acts, it seems a black comedy that is heading down a clichA©d path toward ignominy. Maxwell's behavior is so disturbing and contemptible, you may even be tempted to leave the theater, but a story of love and sacrifice emerges that you may never forget. Maxwell's life is ultimately changed when he is able to see life differently through the eyes of both his best friend and his wife, a Chinese woman who he has arranged to marry through a broker. This film will leave you with profound emotions and may even change your life. 
tt0299135; I wanted my husband to come to the Scottsdale Film festival to see this movie with me, thinking it was going to be a chick flick, hoping he'd see a few images of chauvinistic men seeing the light and then turning themselves around, (I love those gentle reminders). Instead my mother and I went and we rode an emotional roller-coaster during this "enlightening" movie. We Laughed, we cried, we loathed.... the movie was so unpredictable!! (It was a breath of fresh Hollywood air.)Mai Ling was an inspiration. Her performance was beautiful, as was she. It ended up being me who was reminded of compassion and kindness. Patrick Warburton was fantastic... I hated his character so much initially I wanted him to die, and by the end of the movie my heart did a 180!! Well done David Beaird!!! This was definitely one movie worth the price of admission. 
tt0299135; A plot synopsis of this film has been provided by at least one other reviewer, so I'll skip that. What was striking and refreshing about the film was its refusal to get psychological. I don't think anyone can watch this--especially the first 15 minutes--without wondering where Max's incredible anger comes from. It would have been tempting for the writer/director to include some sort of exposition of his childhood and/or his relationship with his mother and other women, either as flashback or monologue. Instead, what you see is what you get. Max is infantile and uncivilized (as the title implies) and no bones are made about it.Still it's tempting to speculate. For example, one wonders if his life became chaotic after the loss of his initial girlfriend--the one we get a very good look at in the beginning--or if it was always like that. Does the absence of unconditional love throw his life into nihilistic disarray, or does he just require a girlfriend to keep his house clean? Why does Mei-Ling accept him twice, the second time after he's humiliated her horribly*? Does she see a big teddy bear in there or is she taking him on as a project? I see this as a strength of the film. Too much psychologizing feels like condescension. "Here. Let me explain every motive the characters have because I'm sure you're not sharp enough to think about them on your own." This is an excellent and powerful film, which ultimately imparts a sense of tenderness and peace without ever becoming mawkish.*After having thought about it and, thanks to comments from other viewers, I have a theory about this question. If a Buddhist would enter hell in order to save another person from it, Mei-Ling continued to accept Max in order to take his place in hell. Perhaps the Buddhists know that such an act will redeem them both. 
tt0299135; My favorite Patrick Warburton character is The Tick. I went to a screening of The Civilization of Maxwell Bright at the Scottsdale Film Festival last night because it looked intriguing, but really, it was because Patrick was presenting the film and doing a Q+A after, and I didn't want to miss anything he might say about The Tick. And then The Civilization of Maxwell Bright ended up being the best film I've seen all year. A great story, direction, acting, cinematography - it was wonderful. Patrick Warburton was absolutely riveting. I can't think of anyone else who could present such a despicable character - an extreme misogynist, and yet keep the audience laughing even during his hateful diatribes against women. His vulnerability underneath all the bluster and anger kept you interested in what would happen instead of just dismissing him and wishing him a horrible fate. I don't want to reveal anything about the story, but if you think you 'know' Patrick Warburton and love him from Seinfeld or the Tick, you will be pleased and maybe surprised to find that he has this depth of talent. And the film has such an emotional impact that one audience member said it made him feel better about death. It was a life -affirming film in the best, non-Lifetime network way.And he DID talk about The Tick! I was very happy. 
tt0299135; The movie starts out with a long shot of a nun meditating at a temple and a voice-over: "A good Buddhist would be willing to jump into hell to save just one other person." Then it cuts to a picture of a Southern California town with a big caption: "HELL".I thought this movie was going to be an amusing comedy about a boor who gets his expectations of a submissive, doll-like mail-order bride turned upside down. He does, but rather than being comedic this movie is dramatic and touching. Maxwell Bright starts out as a guy who is self-destructing and losing everything in life - his business, his friends, his house, his self-image. He thinks he can buy a "geisha girl" who will prop up his ego, but what he gets is a quietly strong woman who both makes him realize what humiliating depths he's sunk to, and pulls him out of them.It seems like a low-budget production because the camera work is a bit choppy and the pacing is terrible - slow bits should be fast and fast bits should be slow - but the writing and acting are great. 
tt0299135; Although there are plot points that you could drive a truck through, this is a well thought out script and the acting is uniformly great. Patrick Warburton really gets to show us his acting chops as the cement headed misogynistic Max Bright and Marie Matiko as Mrs. Bright is the perfect counterpoint to his bluster. Special kudos to Eric Roberts as the long faithful friend. There is Warburton's impressive full frontal nudity that arrives on the scene even before the opening credits roll, but even this robust titillation quickly fades once the story is under-weigh. On the whole I am completely baffled why this little gem of a film has languished in the Never Never Land of "Can't Find a Distributor". For those that care to search it out, it is available on DVD in Australia in the PAL format. It's a legit pressing, but looks like a work print was used for the transfer. It was filmed on video and transfered to film which doesn't help either.Check it out. 
tt0299135; I saw this film at the Milwaukee International Film Festival Oct. 2005. The director/writer warned us it was dark and that we could laugh. And that it was. The time just flew by while we watched the movie, which makes me feel like I didn't waste my time. Max has a lot of issues in this movie. He's a jerk. But somehow, at the end, you're OK with him being that way. I don't want to give away anything. There is nudity and there is a ton of swearing and touchy subject matters, this is not a movie for anyone who dislikes those things. I liked all the casting and the writing/plot was interesting. Didn't see the twist coming. I don't know if Milwaukee received a bad copy (is that even possible anymore?), but the film quality had a bit to be desired. Some bad sound areas and some weird stuff on the film itself, maybe that can be repaired once the film is picked up. I wish them luck!! Patrick Warbarton was in the theater for the viewing. He was very nice. 
tt0299135;  Sex and Violence maintains an even resonance of brutal poetry, and it's also very very funny.  Patrick Warburton brings enough vulnerablility to the despicable Max Bright such that his bilious reaction to life and the people in his sphere is bitingly funny.  Ultimately S&V is all about pain and suffering, disease and abusiveness, but in such a way that the theatre where I saw it was rolling with laughter.  My stomach muscles ached from laughing so hard.  It felt like a Tennessee Williams play done really really well. 
tt0258247;  I had heard a lot of things said about the movie before I saw it nearly two years after it opened, and so was wary of whether or not it would live up to its billing.  The first 45 minutes of this hour-or-so long film are good, but nothing amazing.  Then the action scene and then the scene where Christ comes takes you on an emotional roller-coaster and gets you thinking of what it would be like to be in that situation.  It is very touching.  Nobody moved for nearly 5 minutes after the film was over, many crying.  As one who loves the Book of Mormon, I truly enjoyed how this movie brought to life the most important aspect of it. 
tt0258247;  This superb portrayal of Christ clearly sets Him on His throne for all the viewers to see.  Several scenes suddenly take you inside a masterpiece of art (you think to yourself, I've seen this shot before!) posed as if a famous still-life of the Savior was expanded into a moving picture.The Book of Mormon has intrigue, violence, deception, murder as well as repentance, patience and love.  This film includes each of these elements, ending in the overwhelming message, that Christ is above all of it and God, our Heavenly Father sent Him as a gift "not. . . to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved" Amen and amen! 
tt0258247; The substance of this comment was originally written in October of 2005 and I just checked back and saw that it was deleted after an abuse report was received. Other than my comment not being flattering of the LDS church, I don't understand how it violates any guidelines. If it is objected to again, I hope someone will explain how it violates the guidelines. I think it gives those interested in this movie an important insight into the creation process. Those who are so insecure with their beliefs that they feel the need to censor alternative viewpoints are pretty shallow characters.But on to the movie. I will confirm what many have posted here that this film is very effective at facilitating spiritual feelings in may of its viewers. When I saw it the theater was filled with tears and sniffles at the end.The movie was generally well directed and the cinematography and art direction were all reasonably well done in comparison to major studio pictures. I don't believe it was as well done as its predecessor, Legacy, however, in the acting department. There were a few parts that didn't ring true for me such as the romance, which seemed poorly developed and unbelievable and a strange moment of levity involving the pet monkey when they were announcing the coming of Christ (seemed a bit irreverent).The director of this film, Keith Merrill, came to our Ward for a visit and spoke to us about the film. Several things about his comments were interesting and shed insight into the creative guidelines he was given. He said when he met with the First Presidency of the LDS church to discuss what they were looking for to replace Legacy in the Legacy theater he was given wide latitude with only a few requirements. Two are worth expanding on: First, he was told to only cast actors that had temple recommends (or were temple worthy). He was told that this was because of problems that had arisen with actors which had been cast for Legacy. Merrill didn't elaborate but I later asked around and was told by someone who was on their mission at Nauvoo during the filming that the actor that played Joseph Smith in Legacy was openly homosexual and also openly critical of the LDS church during the filming in a way that was (not surprisingly) disconcerting to the many missionaries and LDS crew members present.There was also another problem with the actress who played the female lead, as it was discovered only after the film was finished that she had appeared nude in two prior movies. (I checked out one of these movies, "The Betsy", in which she is shown seductively disrobing in front of the male lead played by Tommy Lee Jones.) I think this restriction placed by the First Presidency explains what I believe was a comparatively lesser quality in acting since the pool that actors could be drawn from was shallower.The second instruction, which Merrill said came from President Hinkley, was pretty straightforward -- to make sure that everyone that everyone left the theater in tears. As you can see from other reviews, the director hit the mark there. Consider this story the next time you hear someone say they felt the "spirit" in any LDS movie. 
tt0258247;  The Testaments: Of One Fold and One Shepherd is moving and beautiful. It is obviously designed to focus the viewer on Mormonism's focus on the Savior. Nevertheless, most of the acting is well done, the scenery is beautiful, and the story line is interesting.  There are a few glitches (the Savior's feet don't seem to be pierced as he greets Mary on resurrection morning, for example) and some overly-dramatic attempts that fail just a bit (especially lines delivered by the father), but overall I believe the movie is compelling.  After the movie the lights come half-way on while we hear a choir sing a hymn, it is interesting to me that nobody moves during this time - the audience just sits through the three (or so) minute hymn, I think that shows how evocative the movie is, the audience is glad to have some time to just contemplate, wipe tears away and prepare to leave the theater. 
tt0258247;  I was able to see this movie when I was visiting in Utah in the Fall of 2003.Although I can't remember all of the details, I do remember the feeling I had watching the movie. It was awesome. this is the most powerfully spiritual film I have seen, surpassing any of the other church films.As for the movie, I seem to recall that the acting was quite good, the effects were excellent (especially compared to the BOM movie!), and again the story was powerful. It culminates with the Savior's visit to America, and the scene is touching and powerful. I absolutely loved it. 10/10  
tt0258247;  This superb portrayal of Christ clearly sets Him on His throne for all the viewers to see.  Several scenes suddenly take you inside a masterpiece of art (you think to yourself, I've seen this shot before!) posed as if a famous still-life of the Savior was expanded into a moving picture.The Book of Mormon has intrigue, violence, deception, murder as well as repentance, patience and love.  This film includes each of these elements, ending in the overwhelming message, that Christ is above all of it and God, our Heavenly Father sent Him as a gift "not. . . to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved" Amen and amen! 
tt0258247;  Not to say that being a Mormon, or, more correctly, a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is wrong, however, those not familiar with LDS tenets and fundamental doctrines journeying to see this film in Salt Lake City, Utah, or who potentially see it via LDS acquaintances will most likely not be as riveted by the emotionally charged film as those who are. It certainly is meant to rivet and inspire, not to prod our intellect or demand art house enthusiasts'attention, and as most transcendent works it will seem either too sentimental or downright saccharine, but it is so because it caters to an audience whose faith is cradled in its lofty content, such as the visit of Christ to the Americas. For those inclined to study LDS beliefs, and to grasp the exultant joy and adulation they feel for Jesus Christ, this film is a dramatic example of their faith. For those wanting to dive into intellectual quandaries and secular cinematic debate, there are more appropriate venues. 
tt0258247;  What I really liked about this movie was the fact that it used the different styles of movie composition so that anyone who watches the film will get something out of it. If someone likes romance...there is romance. If someone likes intrigue...there's intrigue, etc. The wide ranging movie styles are blended very well into this wonderful and moving movie.The actors did a fabulous job at portraying what the people may have been like and acted like during the time of Christ on earth in America. It gives people a visual of that time in history which is a great teaching tool. I love this movie and I appreciate all who worked on it.  
tt0258247; This short movie just can not be described with words. When watching this movie, especially at the end, tears were forming in my eyes and I felt a closeness to Christ that I can vividly remember to this day. It has inspired me to be a better person as I was able to witness the love of Christ like no other movie. I encourage anyone to watch this movie - whether you are a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints or not. I guarantee you will not be disappointed and you will feel Christ's presence in your heart and be touched. I believe it is still showing in many of the Church's Visitors Centers but may be replaced with a new one that is coming out about Joseph Smith on or around Dec. 24, 2005. See it, before it goes away! 
tt0258247; I can't say truly that I have seen very many movies that I would go back and enjoy seeing over and over again consistently. However, after viewing this particular movie, I can. It is a movie about inner struggles, repentance, love, and best of all, faith. When there is no place else to turn and you are confused, you can turn to our Savior and Redeemer. With an ending that will literally leave you in a pile of tears, this movie is superb. Probably the best by far! I read a comment on here saying that this film was awful. I honestly can't say I understand the logic behind that comment. It is a fantastic missionary movie (and I know because I know of people who saw it, and they became interested in the LDS church.) And also, it is a movie that can relate to us in our day, it can relate to how we struggle inside to find the truth.TWO THUMBS WAY UP! 
tt0057176; How can this not yet have any IMDb comments? The reason must be its relative obscurity in the Anglosphere, in which case it definitely needs to be rediscovered.What I had heard of Robbe-Grillet's own films suggested they were weak in comparison with his collaboration with Resnais, but 'L'Immortelle', at least, totally overturns that suspicion. The plot - what there is of one - is not too dissimilar to 'L'AnnA©e derniA¨re A  Marienbad': a man meets a mysterious woman, loses track of her, finds her again. Or does he? Is he being deceived, or pursuing an erotically alluring phantasm? Once again, the narrative is inherently ambiguous, filled with conflicting testimonies, and arguably of secondary importance to the film's treatment of space and locale.The camera pores over a drowsy Istanbul, following its characters through shuttered windows and on to boats at sea, through cavernous mosques and ruins (which the woman claims are artificial), and crowded bazaars. The formal compositions are as impeccable as those of early Resnais, with actors arranged almost geometrically, like inanimate objects. Some of the shots are reminiscent of Antonioni, such as a slow zoom through the railings of a cemetery, or a long shot which reveals an initially bustling plaza to be deserted. The viewer's eye is tricked (mirroring the perceptual confusion of the central male character), as people appear and disappear, only to reappear within the space of a single pan. Another source of alienation is the use of Turkish speech, which 'our man' cannot understand, and therefore remains untranslated in the subtitles.As one might expect, there is no resolution to this film: its ending is as elusive as its beginning. Some viewers might tire of the repetitiveness of its structure, as scenes are replayed and memories recollected, but I can practically guarantee that fans of Resnais will find much to enjoy. Other later points of comparison might be David Lynch, or the analogous atmosphere of Oriental anxiety in Cronenberg's 'Naked Lunch', but Robbe-Grillet ought to be regarded as a major cinematic artist in his own right, just as he has long been highly regarded for his literary output (the fact that he also published 'L'Immortelle' as a 'cinA©-roman' suggests his belief in the continuum between the two artforms).Postscript: I have subsequently had the opportunity to watch Robbe-Grillet's latest, 'Gradiva' (2006), and unfortunately it leaves one wondering how the mighty have fallen: a sloppy and ridiculous piece of 70s-style pseudo-erotic fantasy (think Borowczyk, but not as good) which totally lacks the visual precision and intellect of 'L'Immortelle'. I can only surmise that his film-making career went downhill steadily after the 1960s, but we should probably cut an 85-year-old man some slack. 
tt0057176; First off, let me qualify my comment by saying that the print of this film I saw was of low quality and that makes it a bit hard to judge the visuals-I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt as they seem good from what I can tell. L'Immortelle is about a French professor who takes a teaching post in Istanbul and finds himself in an alien society. As there are many tourists who travel to this area because of a fascination with the Byzantine era, the natives play up that aspect of their culture for everyone. Through the comments of the mysterious woman to that effect, the film calls the authenticity of the architecture and artwork into question again and again. While this may sound like it leads to a portrayal of the city that makes it seem fake, the opposite is actually true. The fake city that is shown off to tourists hides mysteries that are near impenetrable. The willingness of the natives to share the false culture is a perfect excuse for keeping the truth hidden. The plot of the film focuses on the professor's encounters (and attempts at romance) with a mysterious woman. She constantly deceives him in a way that is similar to the deceptions of the city itself to outsiders. Paradoxically, she actually points out the faux culture that surrounds them while maintaining her own deceptions. Viewers who are looking for meaning here may see her mystery as a symbol for that of the city the film explores. Eventually the woman disappears from our protagonist's life and despite all of his efforts to find out more about her he ultimately fails to learn anything definite. Like the viewer, he is left to ponder what (if anything) his experiences mean. As a frame of reference, one might say that L'Immortelle is like a combination of L'Avventura and Last Year at Marienbad. Like the former film it includes an unsolvable mystery and like the latter it uses the language of cinema to call memory itself into question (late in L'Immortelle there are remembered versions of scenes from earlier in the film that are different from the originals). Still, L'Immortelle lacks the clarity and coherence of either of those films, making it a minor albeit unjustly ignored classic. 
tt0057176; No spoiler here, but I do want to disagree with one of the former posts that claimed there was no resolution. I think there is a very definite and forceful resolution, that can be missed if one exaggerates the stiff professor seeking his lost and mysterious paramour. That pseudo-plot does resemble L'aventurra and Last Year at Marienbad, however.I saw this film in a new 35 mm. print, along with Robbe-Grillet's 2nd film, Trans-Europe Express. Taken together, they provide very clear clues to what Robbe-Grillet is up to, how they relate to Last Year at Marienbad. what one can expect, and why Robbe-Grillet is important.Last Year at Marienbad overwhelmed the viewer with its fascinating cinematography, set in a spacious European hotel and its extensive formal gardens. Substitute Istanbul, with its ruins, streets, and back alleys for the formal gardens, in L'immortelle, and you can sit back and enjoy the movie for its visuals alone. Trans-Europe Express seems to find anything and everything in Antwerp that is photogenic, punctuated by shots of trains, inside and out.Highly charged eroticism is another feature of L'immortelle, with scenes of the gestures that precede f**ing, gestures that break off before the culminating copulation, which is left to the viewer's imagination. And Robbe-Gillet throws in a seemingly gratuitous scene in which the viewer joins the patrons of a night club to view a very alluring dance act. But maybe not so gratuitous, rather a signature scene, since Trans-Europe Express, also includes such a highly charged night club dance. Since L'immortelle begins with the protagonist solitarily looking out of the window, a scene that recurs several times, I interpret that as indicating that what we are seeing is from the point of view of that character. Perhaps someone can supply us with insight into how these dance scenes function as parts of the entire movie.There is not a lot of dialog, and, what there is, frequently affirms the fakery of the entire city of Istanbul, in which the very ruins are claimed to be currently produced only for the delectation of tourists. As we view the astoundingly photogenic visual details, these are constantly being undermined by that theme. The tourist as voyeur suggests that we, too, viewing the movie, are viewers of something that is unreal.To summarize: what one can expect in a Robbe-Grillet film, based on his first two, includes a feast of photogenic visual background, a preoccupation with erotic desire from a male point of view, and a deconstruction of what is being portrayed, a deconstruction that suggests that cinema itself is becoming aware of its own fakery. 
tt0057176; Fresh from "Last Year at Marienbad", Alain Robbe-Grillet not only wrote, but directed, this brilliantly rendered exercise in cinematic style. The superb combination of story, actors, setting, cinematography, editing, music and sound all make this a cinematic experience of the highest order.A Frenchman, newly arrived in Turkey, encounters a beautiful woman, and meets her again on several occasions, but learns virtually nothing about her - although she appears to be shadowed by a man in sunglasses with two Dobermans, when she fails to keep a rendezvous, he attempts to find her, but is hindered by his foreignness in an alien culture. The lugubrious Jacques Doniol-Valcroze makes the perfect foil for the "eternal feminine" embodied by Francoise Brion - exquisitely desirable, in stunningly elegant clothes and coiffures, with a seemingly sunny and open manner, but ultimately opaque. Filmed in crisp black-and-white images, the Istanbul locales (mosque, houses, cafA©s, streets and seascapes) give the film its magical background of fantasy grounded in realism. The stunningly shot and edited scene in the plaza, at first populated (a la "Marienbad") with stationary people casting no shadows, then empty, with only Brion walking across it, is one highlight of a film filled with many memorable shots and sequences: the fisherman by the bay, the woman seen - in memory or fantasy? - through the slats of the wooden blinds, the cemetery of steles - by day - and at night, the wooded glen, when the woman writes her address on a paper, which she then casts away - and the man later searches for it, the excavation with the long, steep staircase, the vendor outside the mosque who pretends (or does he?) not to speak French, and the photo set he gives to the man, with the woman in the shadow - scenes not soon to be forgotten. In the background, the recurring diegetic Turkish music, dogs barking, the murmur of the sea and the city - all so endemic that it's a surprise to see a music credit for Georges Delerue in the end credits. All in all, a landmark of inventive cinema from its period of peak creativity.Seen at the French Institute, NYC, on February 19, 2008, programmed, coincidentally (?), one day after the death of Robbe-Grillet. Excellent print, but slightly spoiled by a bubble in the screen, which caused an irritating rippling effect for the many panning shots. 
tt0057176; N travels to Istanbul to take up a teaching job, taking a month off to get himself familiarised with the country he gets lost and asks L to help him. He falls in love with her and becomes obsessed with her mysterious connection to M, a sunglass-wearing stylish man accompanied everywhere by Dobermans. L disappears and N begins a frantic search for her. He finds her only to tragically lose her once more. It's possible that N's name is AndrA©, it's less certain whether L's real name is Lucille or Lane. If this weren't confusing enough, there is a plot about white slavery in Istanbul. Or maybe not.This is the spectacular debut of Alain Robbe-Grillet, the screenwriter of Alain Resnais' mind trip Last Year In Marienbad. Once again he subverts the conventions of narrative by fracturing timelines, contradicting the facts of the action from chapter to chapter, interrupting the flow of the narrative with repetitive descriptions of objects and ending the novels on a note of ambiguity.L'Immortelle is all about deception and artificiality. L gives N a guided tour across Istanbul, promising him to show him its cultural treasures only to bring attention to their own falsehood. Istanbul is a city putting on an act for the tourists, she explains, mythical Istanbul only exists as an illusion to meet the Westerners' stereotypes. As L demystifies Istanbul, her own mysteries deepen. Why does she pretend not to understand Turkish? Who is the sun-glassed man N sees her with on several occasions? Is he a pimp or the leader of a white slavery ring? And why does she disappear? This movie takes a sadistic pleasure in teasing the viewer and denying him a clear answer. It brings up questions of identity and memory but confuses the answers through multiple interpretations, and in the end says there aren't any answers at all. The viewer who enjoys these perverse entertainments must be the rare person who loves frustration in his art.If the plot is deliberately sparse, the technical construction of the movie is exuberant. Released in the same year two revolutionary movies Â<U+0096> Otto e Mezzo and Contempt Â<U+0096>changed the art of cinema, L'Immortelle followed a different path to filmmaking while retaining its own originality.Constructed in order to resemble the imperfection and fleetingness of memory, the movie builds itself upon successive layers of flashbacks, obsessively repeated with disorienting variations. A gesture of the hand performed in middle of a forest is re-enacted in a hotel room, a scene is re-imagined with different characters.The scenes cut abruptly into each other proudly piling up what is commonly called continuity errors. A character wearing a white suit stands disoriented in the middle of a street, as the scene cuts to him climbing a street he wears a black suit. N and L leave a mansion on the margin of the Bosphorus by a row-boat, only for the scene to shift to the two watching from a ferry the same boat coming into the river. Try to make sense of this, dear viewer.If this visual confusion weren't enough, the sound, designed by Michel Fano, further serves to disrupt the intelligibility of the action. A howling at the beginning of the movie is heard again in a tragic scene later on. Often disconnected from the image, sounds and noises follow their own logic and reoccur like musical themes.Little information is given about the characters. During a stroll in the woods, N asks L for her home address. He doesn't even know where she lives. She asks him something to write on and he hands her a blank page and a pen. She writes something on it but throws the paper away, telling him not to bother to look for it because what she wrote is false. After she disappears halfway into the film, N searches for the blank paper but when he finds it, it's blank. She never wrote anything on it. Always the movie points to the unreality and falsity of everything.The movie doesn't flow as a linear narrative but moves as a circle, it builds on the cumulative effect of repetition. After visiting all of Istanbul together, an obsessed N in search of L starts retracing all his steps, discovering by himself the secrets of the city. Even limited by the barrier of language, N scratches a conspiracy that may involve street peddlers of tourist souvenirs, shop-keepers, and the cops, all involved in a mystery that may have something to do with kidnapped women. Is the mystery really worth knowing? Probably not, I doubt Robbe-Grillet really thought it through. But the viewer should understand this is not a movie to watch to know what happens, but how it happens.The movie is not character-driven and the actors don't perform. They gesture. They move their heads in slow form, smile, stare, or they stay fixed. One of the most unsettling traits of the movie is the fact that time seems suspended around L and N. As they walk the streets, the figures of the passersby remain frozen like statues, as if in anticipation of something. This was an idea Robbe-Grillet took from 'Marienbad,' but here it's much more involving since it affects an entire city.Although there is no acting here in the traditional sense, that is not to say the actors weren't perfectly chosen. Jacques Doniol-Valcroze, with his wide eyes and impersonality, is the stand-in for the viewer, the anchor that keeps the viewer focused. Through him we watch and try to understand. Like him we're totally clueless. The sensual FranA§oise Brion is a cipher without substance, hiding herself behind her seductive smile and her dream-like voice with its perfect tone for the narrative of a story that seems the cross between a fairy-tale and surrealist experiment.Robbe-Grillet enchants, surprises and torments with the dazzling procession of sounds, sights and expectations that constitute this cinematic labyrinth. 
tt0057176; Around 1960 French cinema introduced 'Nouvelle Vague' (= French for 'New Wave'). This style of filming, quite revolutionary back then, soon spread abroad. To Italy for instance, where masters as Fellini and Antonioni made their impressive careers with it.'Nouvelle Vague' is said to be based on the then new realization that sometimes techniques control men, instead of the other way round. The new filming perfectly reflects all nagging uncertainties coming from this new insight.In 'Nouvelle Vague' we see people doubting themselves and their relations. People seeking for certainty and security in life, which they may find in their surroundings: 'Novelle Vague' often excels in shooting architectural beauty.'L'immortelle' (= French for 'the Immortal') features all 'Nouvelle Vague'-styling. Set in Instanbul for a change, bringing in some Turkish & oriental culture. Not surprisingly its story is inconclusive, leaving you in doubt about what really happened.I don't think 'l'immortelle' can match productions like Antonioni's 'l'avventura', or Fellini's 'la dolce vita'. However, it makes a good second place -- still providing a good watch. 
tt0057176; It's difficult to believe that Tobbe-Grillet isn't taking the mickey here because he has made the ultimate movie FOR posers by making one ABOUT posers. Literally. He clearly saved a fortune on actors by just getting passers-by to stand perfectly still and expressionless. Even a DOG poses in the middle of the road. I note that after more than 20 years there are NO comments here and I can't believe that the usual pseuds/academics missed it but anything's possible. I can't believe I'm writing this but the movie (if that's what it is) opens with a guy (turns out he was one of the founders of Cahiers du Cinema, surprise, surprise) standing not only still but robot-like in a sterile room. Then there's a shot of a woman doing guess what? That's right, you got it in one. More? Why not. There's a really GREAT shot of an old guy sitting stock still on the waterfront while a dead fish lies on the dock, a shot of a man and a woman standing equally still etcetera, etcetera and these shots are HELD for what seems like forever but is probably no more than forty or fifty seconds and there's even a shot of a group of people POSING in a square. Now what this all means your guess is as good as mine unless, of course, you're a pseud and/or academic in which case you've already awarded Robbe-Grillet the Golden Ego Massager. Otherwise come back the Carry On series, all is forgiven. 
tt0057176; While the print of this one was more pleasing than the other Robbe-Grillet titles I watched to commemorate his recent passing, the viewing itself was marred by a couple of instances of temporary freezing. The film, then, was perhaps the most pretentious and, well, tedious of the lot â<U+0080><U+0093> given that thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s hardly any discernible plot!Again, weâ<U+0080><U+0099>re thrown into a remote Arabian locale (complete with relentless â<U+0080><U+0093> and, consequently, extremely irritating â<U+0080><U+0093> religious chanting) with, at its centre, a glamorous yet vapid femme fatale in Francoise Brion â<U+0080><U+0093> to whom the title is presumably referring. Frankly, Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m at pains to recall just what went on in the film â<U+0080><U+0093> even if only a little over 36 hours have elapsed since thenâ<U+0080>¦which is never a good thing but, usually, this is a predicament I find myself in after having watched some mindless/low-brow action flick and not a respected art-house one! Whatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s certain is that, as a film about the search for a missing enigmatic girl, itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s far less compelling and satisfying than Michelangelo Antonioniâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Lâ<U+0080><U+0099>AVVENTURA (1960)! Incidentally, the bewildered hero of THE IMMORTAL ONE is played by Jacques Doniol-Valcroze â<U+0080><U+0093> who happens to be a film-maker in his own right, actually one of the lesser (and, therefore, least-known) exponents of the â<U+0080><U+009C>Nouvelle Vagueâ<U+0080><U+009D>.Though I have to admit that â<U+0080><U+0093> in the long run â<U+0080><U+0093> I was disappointed by the mini-marathon dedicated to this influential novelist and highbrow film-maker, Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>d still be interested in checking out the other efforts he directed (not to mention hope to catch these three again in better representations and, perhaps, a more amenable frame-of-mind). In any case, I still have Alain Resnaisâ<U+0080><U+0099> demanding but highly-acclaimed LAST YEAR IN MARIENBAD (1961) â<U+0080><U+0093> which Robbe-Grillet wrote, and for which he even garnered an Oscar nomination â<U+0080><U+0093> to re-acquaint myself with, and that is sure to be an infinitely more rewarding experience... 
tt0089851;  Since I began living in South Korea several years ago, I have always been curious about what life and art would be like in the isolated North.  The educational channel in South Korea (EBS) has a weekly show that gives us clips of North Korean newscasts, movies, music,  dramas and animation.When South Korean president, Kim Dae-jung visited North Korea last year in the first step toward normalizing relations and possible (albeit future) unification, we learned that the North Korean supreme leader is something of a movie fanatic.  He has been secretly receiving western movies and monitoring South Korean tv dramas.  It is not surprising to learn that he apparently ordered Pulgasari be made.  Like every other artform from the North it can only be broadcast or shown if it matches the philosophy of the state. Pulgasari is a metaphor.  The evil king represents the feudal government of the Chosun Dynasty which ended at the beginning of the 1900's.  The monster, Pulgasari represents capitalism.  It arrives apparently to help the people, but soon grows out of control.  The heroes in the movie are the peasantry, the common people who must fix everything that people with power have wrought.Nobody can claim that Pulgasari is state-of-the-art.  Even by rubber monster standards, this movies special effects are poor.  It does help to consider that the budget for this movie was probably around what we spend on lunch in a year. But for me, the true fascination of a movie like this is the chance to see how another culture, living under a completely different philosophy, sees the world. 
tt0089851;  The backstory to this movie is pretty darn incredible - made in North Korea by the country's dictator - the director and two lead performers were actually kidnapped from S. Korea after they refused to work on this movie with the dictator. Seriously - not kidding. As for the movie itself - it is pretty good in many ways. The story itself works as an old village myth - an iron eating monster comes to life to save poor farmers and villagers from a cruel warlord. The effects are cheesy and silly but some of the battle sequences are impressive for no other reasons then you can tell there are literally thousands of people fighting in these scenes. After all the CGI effects of recent time - it was refreshing and stunning to see so many actual people being used in a big battle. Then again, they probably didn't have much choice. I guess if the dictator of a country tells you to be in his movie, you are in the movie!! 
tt0089851; first of all, its unfair to compare this movie with a Hollywood product: this is an eastern "man-in-rubber-suit" monster movie made in north Korea and must be evaluated as such. and in his niche this is one of the very best. for the originality and meanings it deserves to be put on the same level of Honda's Godzilla of 1954. it sports believable effects, real mass scenes (ok they were soldiers drafted to act in a movie but nevertheless it's better than what i've seen in "Gappa") and believe it or not a plot that is less nonsense than the usual Gamera - Rodan - Godzilla - Gappa stuff we got used to. at least all the story is more fantastic than Sci-Fi and this places everything on a completely different perspective. "comedy" episodes are laughable but i suppose that asking to a North-Korean movie to meet the standard humor tastes of a western audience is way too much. the interpretative key of the story revolves around the goods and evils of capitalism ,one may appreciate or not the intentions but go find another Kaiju with more sense than "the Japanese are still scared after the atom bomb, poor souls", and "the Japanese scientists save the world". Pulgasari is finally less nationalistic than the average Japanese movie, and this is outstanding for a product of a dictatorial country, isn't ? 
tt0089851; As the workers have a hard time rebelling against the oppressive (pre colonized) Chosen regime they get unexpected help from the gods. Bulgasari awakens to life from a figure of clay and rice with the drop of blood from Ami and is thereby under her authority. This secret weapon was exactly what they needed in order to kill the king, but it grows out of control. Whether this monster represents capitalism or not is anyones guess, I didn't notice anything that pointed towards that conclusion in the movie, but there's always the juche discourse to look it in the light of. After all Kim Jong-il is listed as a producer. With that in mind, I got a little bit anxious by the ending.As a movie it is OK. The script is very simple and the characters are, like the weapons, like cardboard cutouts. Some of the berserker smashing the temples (cultural revolution style?) however, were quite impressive. All the shouting and wailing were not. I wonder if there's a movie were the title of it is repeated more often than in this. 
tt0089851; I like to watch Kaiju films and this Korean monster movie it's a funny monster movie with great battle scenes. In the beginning I supposed that will be other bad movie, but after some scenes you'll be invited to appreciate the story about poor villain people that fight against a bad king and his cruelty governor. Besides the poor special effects, most of them inside the atmosphere behind the Pulgarasi monster, other great battle scenes with hundred extras acting and fighting, You'll like all the crew efforth to create power and big scenes. This movie was produced by Jong-il Kim and directed by Sang-OK Shin. This is the first movie that I watch directed by Sang-OK Shin, but I felt interested in watch other movies directed by him. 
tt0089851; Filmed in 1985 by a director (Sang OK Shin) who had been kidnapped by North Korea. this movie is about a monster who is created by a blacksmith just prior to his death to help his village against an evil king. Now from what I understand Kim Jong Il (the eventual leader of North Korea) was an avid movie buff and wanted Sang OK Shin to produce a film along the lines of "Godzilla". This movie is the final product. Unfortunately, this movie doesn't translate as well to world-wide audiences as its famous predecessor did. That's not to say that this movie is necessarily bad but it clearly had some weaknesses. For starters, the special effects were quite poor and the movie had some scenes which could have definitely been trimmed here and there. Along with that the movie I saw was filmed in Korean but had English subtitles. I only mention this because this is a film that is probably best suited for young children and subtitles simply won't suffice for that particular audience. Be that as it may I rate the movie as slightly below average. 
tt0089851; Seldom have I watched a movie that fails so completely in all that it attempts to do. There could be a good reason for this, however, the director and two leads were abducted from South Korea by Kim and then forced to partake in this schlock whilst the Dear Executive Producer Kim Jong Il ran the show. This was ten years before he became the ruler of North Korea. I guess he runs his country on the same principles as he ran the production of this movie. (Un)fortunately the kidnapping victims escaped before the movie could be completed, which could explain much of the disjointed nature in the latter part of the film. Quite bizarrely, the director's 'punishment' was to have his name removed from the credits, until he SUED the film company to have it re-instated, although heaven only knows why.The movie opens in a nameless village somewhere in Chosun Dynasty era Korea. A peasant girl is fetching water from a well. She is a kind and selfless young woman, as indicated by her desire to see the old people fed first at dinner time. Her father is the town blacksmith and makes many tools for the farmers. All is not well in the idyllic village, however. An evil king sits on the throne and a great rebellion/war is brewing. He has his army appropriate all the metal in the kingdom in order to forge weapons. It emerges that the leader of the bandits/rebels lives in this particular village and has hidden a weapons cache near the blacksmith's forge. The first of many 'epic' battle scenes unfurls as Korean People's Army soldiers forced to act as extras fight it out dressed as wicked royal guards slavishly obeying the king and virtuous peasants defending their right to bear pots and pans. Yawn.The rebels are routed and arrested, and the blacksmith is then drafted to make weapons out of the confiscated metal, but allows the village people to take back their items when the army leaves. The army comes back and discovers the iron gone and this leads to his imprisonment and torture. As a form of protest, he decides not to eat and begins to starve. His daughter, Ami, tries to get him to eat rice balls by throwing them to him through the bars of the jail. He is a man of principle, however, and refuses to eat even this food prepared by his loving daughter. Instead, he makes a little figurine of the rice balls and clay and makes a dying wish to some unseen force to give it life and help the peasants. He then dies and the obligatory wailing so prolific in North Korean films starts. Once Ami, her brother, her mother, the village, the bandits, and their dogs have recovered from the loss, wiped their tears away and shouted 'aigoo' for the last time, the little sculpture finds its way to Ami. She pricks herself whilst sewing and some blood splashes onto it, bringing it to life. Pulgasari is born, and from this point on the movie never lets you forget that his name is PULGASARI! Every time PULGASARI gets screen time there is an annoying peasant/bandit/king/vizier/random extra shouting 'It's PULGASARI!', 'Hey, PULGASARI!', 'LOOK OUT IT'SÂ ' or 'HERE COMES Â ' Only the heinous abomination that is 'The Outlaw of Gor' can rival the number of times the lead character's name is repeated as part of the movie dialog.So moving on, Pulgasari starts out small, he eats the needle Ami was using, then he eats the door hinges, then he eats the scrap metal in the forge. He grows bigger and bigger under Ami's control, since it's her blood that infused him with life. I immediately saw a problem with this monster, the peasants' woe is due mainly to the fact that the king wants all their metal for weapons, but their newfound hero eats the same metal. The rest of the film uses made for TV effects reminiscent of 'Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers' as Pulgasari stomps his way through Feudal Korea MiniTown, killing the king and liberating the peasants. Stuff happens along the way but the rubber suit is more convincing than the plot and character development. Predictably, the monster continues to eat metal, and becomes a burden to the peasants. Ami sacrifices herself by hiding in the village's bell before Pulgasari eats it. Pulgasari and Ami die. Roll credits on the ninety minutes of my life that cannot be taken back, a horrid mess of a movie that cannot be unseen.Reflecting on the didactic nature of the several North Korean films I have watched IE: Peasants Good/Powers that be Bad, I'd have to say that there you could interpret this as a young Kim Jong Il giving the middle finger to an establishment that had molded him from a young age to take over from his father, despite his wishes of film making glory. In 'The Flower Girl' we see how the peasants are oppressed and need the Korean Liberation Army to free them, it takes food, lives and money (metal) to support in order to drive out the Japanese Imperialists (the evil king taking the peasant's resources) but once in power, the KLA and the Communist Party continue to take all of these things from the peasants, eventually requiring the peasants to die in order to rid themselves of the scourge that they themselves have helped feed. The irony would be delicious, but I think that it's actually just a ham fisted attempt to knock capitalism, yet another aspect of this movie that fails with unintentional, yet hilarious results. 
tt0089851; Straight away, I saw the movie being similar in the way the set and the actors were playing. The officials' clothes look the same, and the way of acting is also the same. The monster is created from rice and then is set upon eating the iron of the whole province, whilst destroying the government. Not so bad, there's even a moral to the story, which is that the iron-eating monster, whilst helping the villagers being free, cannot (in the end) be controlled either but this is not a reason to censor the movie. Not worth buying the DVD, but good enough to watch, this makes a light evening screening, and it is better to watch with friends. 
tt0089851;  My MIND! MY MIND!!!!!! I CAN'T STAND IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I'm sure years of therapy will erase the scars left by this movie, but I don't have that much time.Okay lets start with a plot run down and I'll bleed from there...I'll be brief-A blacksmith who won't make weapons to stop a rebellion is pitched into jail and starved to death. As a legacy to his children he leaves a small metal doll which comes alive when one of the blacksmith's daughters gets a drop of blood on it. The monster eats metal and begins to grow.The rebels battle the government with the monster. The monster grows bigger and bigger and even after the rebels win the monster still goes on eating and growing until some way has to be found to destroy the beast....Its a weird twist on the Daimajin films from Japan.The monster is one of the stiffest rubber suits I've ever seen outside of a bondage film and is screamingly funny to look at.You can see how the head piece sits on the body. The actor playing the monster at times looks like a boxer warming up for a fight weaving and rocking in a jerky style that brought giggles to this viewer.(Those of you into bondage may want to see about getting one for yourself since it severely limits movement and is probably torturous to wear) The "blue screen" work is laughable, simply because the film stocks don't match.The destruction scenes are surprisingly good and well done, in many ways better than most Godzilla films. The collapse of the buildings seems to be very realistic.The battle scenes while epic in scale are laughable simply because many of the weapons,say the boulders are, obviously cardboard or plaster. There are thousands of people on screen for some scenes and it looks good but they are often simply running to and fro.The film is supposedly a North Korean fable about the evils of capitalism and what ever else Kim Jong-il deemed it to be about.My question is who did they think this film is for? It looks like a TV series blown up to feature size. The level of the story seems to be that of a second or third grade mentality, especially in its humor but it has real animals being carved up, torture, nasty battlefield death and ideas that no child would grasp or care about. Its a childrens film made for adults.This is one of those its so bad its...something movies. Its a mind warp and complete mess. I like bits of it and other bits leave me with slack jawed disbelief. Frankly I was thinking that if it was suppose to be a tongue in cheek sort of thing then I could consider it a good joke film, but since the film is serious and meant to "mean" something then its a disaster.AND LEST YOU ASK IF I'M CERTAIN ITS SERIOUS---- The South Korean director was kidnapped by the North Koreans to make movies like this for them. Luckily he eventually escaped.Do I think you should see this movie?First how much do you love giant monsters?Second how drunk can you get and still see the screen clearly?I don't think you really need to see this unless you want to laugh your ass off with drunken buddies or if you really need to see every rubber suited giant monster movie ever made.Either way DO NOT WATCH THIS ALONE, you'll need someone to help you pick up your jaw off the floor.(And no its not one of the worst films I've ever seen, just one of the most inept) 
tt0100990; Juana Ines de la Cruz was a woman ahead of her times. She had everything going against her, she was a woman, she had intelligence, and she intimidated the people around her. Everything conspired to make her a target for the higher ups in the Catholic Church in Mexico. The Archbishop wanted to silence her at all costs.These were the times when the so called Holy Inquisition was an instrument of the Church to get rid of anyone considered heretic, or who would question the dogma. It was a convenient way to get rid of the enemies, as the Catholic Church had such power that no one dared to challenge it.Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz wrote some of the best poetry known in the Spanish literature. Her work has survived because of the strength and beauty of her work. Sor Juana was befriended by the Spanish Viceroy and his wife. The virreina, in particular, saw in Juana a kindred spirit. Their relationship had shades of lesbianism, although only a chaste kiss is exchanged between them. When the Medinacellis are recalled home, Sor Juana is left at the mercy of the evil Archbishop who is bent in destroying her. Sor Juana Ines succumbs to the pest that took thousands in her country without being recognized in life for all she gave the world.Maria Luisa Bemberg, a feminist film maker, puts her stamp in this story by bringing together the influential virreina and Sor Juana, a combination of two strong women who lived during a period of uncertainty in Spain and her colonies in the new world.Asumpta Serna has some good moments as Juana Ines de la Cruz. Dominique Sanda is also effective playing opposite Ms. Serna as the virreina. Hector Alterio, Lautaro Murua, and the rest of the cast do a good job supporting the principal players. Cecilia Roth's dubbed the voice for Ms. Sanda.Felix Monti's dark cinematography serves the film well. The film was photographed in a studio, and at times, it looks as though it is a theater set. Ms. Bemberg directed with a sure hand and got a lot out of her cast and crew. 
tt0100990; When I picked up this DVD, I thought this was a movie whose main theme was Lesbianism--at least that's what many would assume about it judging by the DVD cover. And while this might have made a very interesting subject for a film, this was not at all what the film was about in the least!! Apart from a rather innocent kiss between Sister Juana and her lady friend, there is NOTHING about this film that could be construed as a gay or even straight picture. The women MIGHT have been in love with each other, but they never acted upon this and this really wasn't the main message of the film.Instead, its a story about a real-life nun, poet and scholar and the difficulties encountered by being all these during the days of the Spanish Inquisition. Juana is a brilliant and very accomplished woman who was not allowed to enter the university because women simply weren't allowed to do this. A woman either needed to marry and make babies or become a nun--and she chose to become a nun because she believed she could pursue her studies of space, the word, philosophy, and especially poetry this way. And for a while, this was the case--until an overzealous new Mexican Archbishop saw her curiosity about the world as a sign of wickedness! Instead of Lesbianism, the film is actually about wasted talent and misogyny--a super-talented lady who was despised for being different! This movie would be excellent fair for teens and young adults--especially young women daring to walk their own path. As a father of two very accomplished girls, I would hope that this real-life story would inspire them.As far as the technical merits of the movie go, it is very well acted, written and produced. It was a bit slow-going at times, but considering it was reality, this can't be helped. And despite this, the film could have been scored a 9 by me--it was very, very close. 
tt0100990;  The movie is well made, although not much money seems to have been spent on sets! It sticks fairly closely to the basic historical data, but a quick read up on Sor Juana in the Encyclopedia Brittanica might help many viewers.Now to the rating issue. There is no good reason why this movie should be restricted to those over 18 by Amazon and other online merchants. There is no overt nudity or genital sex. There is a fairly chaste kiss between women. I suppose the violent scenes of nuns whipping themsleves in a penitential exercise might be offensive to some, but self-flagellation was indeed a part of Catholic monastic life until well into the 20th century, and the scene is not presented in any prurient way. If this amounts to a need to ban the movie for young people, then the Bible also would need to be banned. It has far more sex, nudity, and violence.The writers who object to the "Lesbian passion" line on the box do have a point. Anyone buying this for erotic arousal would be profoundly mislead.There is, however, a real lesbian aspect to this film. Sor Juana is clearly a "woman identified woman." She achieves her greatest triumphs while in the nurturing and all-female world of the Convent, her relationship with the Vicereine is the most heated in the film, and the destruction of her writing comes from the intrusion of the exclusively male world of the church hierarchy and the inquistion. Most importantly, her writing reflects an explicit feminist critique of women's oppression.Just as one does not need to have genital sex in order to be a "heterosexual," neither does one need genital sex in order to be part of the lesbian continuum. Sor Juana is indeed part of the that continuum.  
tt0100990; Who would have guessed that there is a genre out there called nunsploitation. I am not sure what it means, but this film appears to be included.It is the story of a Mexican nun that was decidedly feminist. You can look up Juana InA©s de la Cruz on Wikipedia and it will give you more. Apparently this film is historically accurate according to those I have consulted.The main thrust of this film is the intense hatred (Can one say fear?) of women by the Church through the ages, which continues to this day. It examines the Inquisition, by which the Church sought to stifle creativity and thinking.One would do well to know the status of women in the Church at the time to properly understand and enjoy this film. The role of women can be defined: "it is right for (women) to pride themselves on being silent, both those for whom it is convenient to cover up their lack of knowledge, and those who might shamelessly reveal what they know, because in all of them it is not only an agreeable condition, but a proper virtue, to speak little and be silent." Unlike Saint Teresa, Sr Juana is castigated not canonized for the audacity to speak her mind, to seek knowledge, and to think.If you seek the "lesbian passion behind convent walls" that is on the DVD cover, you will be sorely disappointed. While a lesbian relationship might be strongly suggested between Sr Juana and her noble protectress, it is never overtly expressed with the exception of a kiss that would be considered an "air kiss" compared to the one Phoebe gave Rachel on "Friends." The film was extremely interesting and Assumpta Serna was outstanding as Sr Juana. 
tt0100990; This is one of the few times in cinematic history where so much of the Spanisn Inquisition was explained for the full detail of what it entailed. I learned more about the politics of that time through this film than in my history classes. The connection Spain had with the 'new world' was stronger than any Britain had with her 'new world'.If you have a passion for history, a passion for what shaped the way the Catholic church now runs its show (in perspective with its history), then this movie is a must see.The acting, the writing, the production is second to none.I first saw this film in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1992 at the Edinburgh Film Festival... I've since looked for it elsewhere unsuccessfully... 
tt0100990;  The best reason to see this movie is on account of the gorgeous camerawork, every frame is like stepping inside an art gallery. Velasquez in particular comes to mind, especially his Bodegones (kitchen pictures), which emphasized the inner dignity of maids and dishwashers. (A Spanish movie with a similar feel is Los Santos Inocentes).The pacing is extremely slow, as befits a story which is about the inner faith and turmoil of a 17th century poet-nun (Sor Juana). She always considered the external events of her life as secondary to the inner spiritual matters of faith and poetry, and this film attempts to portray that. You should not watch this unless you are comfortable with introspective meditation.Director Bemberg has a lot to say about the destruction of women's creative abilities through history (and should we be so arrogant as to suppose it never happens now?).  <SPOILER> Sor Juana at the end of the film resembles the victim of torture or lobotomy, although we may suppose that the church used more subtle means to destroy her personality. (We aren't told what these are, but we see how she is then "terminated" by being sent to work in a plague hospital, where she succumbs).Sor Juana's relationships with those around her are shown with delicacy and depth, the acting is flawless. This film almost resembles silent cinema in the way it portrays glance-against-glance with few words being spoken. However, we sometimes get to hear Sor Juana"s poetry recited, usually in voice-over. Again, viewers uncomfortable with the contemplative approach are warned to stay away.YLPDT has probably suffered from the worst publicity-advertising of any movie ever, ensuring that it will be seen by those who don't like it and ignored by those who would have enjoyed it. If it is ever re-issued on VHS/DVD, let us hope the manufacturers show a bit more taste.  
tt0100990;  This film is an interesting historical piece set in the late 17th century. It is in Spanish and is based on a book by noted Mexican author Octavio Paz, which was itself based on a true story.  The story is about Sor Juana, a nun and poet in Spanish Mexico who challenges the theology of the archbishop. In doing so, it also explores the tension between the church and the crown, in this case between the archbishop and the viceroy, who supports Sor Juana. The camera work and use of color, light, and shadow throughout the film sets the mood quite well.  While it occasionally seems a little drawn out, in general it is an interesting, effective and entertaining work.  
tt0100990; Sor Juana battles through the film, a true story, to win the right to study. An interesting film, particularly from the feminist perspective. It is in ways uplifting to be reminded of women like Sor Juana, who stood up for women's rights to intelligence and who braved the wrath of the church. The ending, in particular, carries a great deal of poignancy. It is, in fact, fabricated by director Maria Luisa Bemberg, who, a Catholic feminist herself, wanted to portray the patriarchal Catholic church in a certain (negative) way. Sor Juana renounces her writing in the film, an ending which subverts history, however, there are many aspects of mise-en-scene that undermine the obvious reading that Juana is defeated. For example, she signs with her own blood (Bemberg was aware of the connotations of female blood for the Catholics) and there is a note at the end pointing out that Sor Juana is considered one of the greatest poets of her age, which shows that despite her apparent defeat, she still managed to be more famous than her oppressors to this day. There is no evidence that Juana ever renounced her writing, according to history she appeared to simply stopped writing. However, her self-humiliation at the end makes the film far more poignant, and her status as a brilliant scholar and poet all the more deserved and righteous, given the suffering she underwent. 
tt0100990; The true story of Sister Juana Inez de la Cruz, a nun in 17th century Mexico, born a peasant, who later became known as one of the great poets of the Spanish language. But in her own time she was crushed by a Catholic church frightened of women pursuing intellectual or artistic truths The film is beautifully shot, well acted, and always interesting. It's an important story of an early feminist. But I had a few problems. First, the highly theatrical sets and lighting, while a style I often respond to, didn't really seem to be serving a purpose here since the story is acted and written in a fairly naturalistic, straightforward way. I found myself pulled out of the film again and again to say 'neat lighting' or 'cool set'. Perhaps more importantly, the climatic twist of the film, Sister Juana's finally having her spirit and soul crushed by the church, happens way too rapidly, and mostly off-camera. This is a woman who would seem ready to be put to death by the Inquisition for being herself, and suddenly, without our seeing how it happened she is mopping the floor, and staring off into space. Last, the film sets up its antagonists, and their positions of power so clearly, that there is only one possible path for the story to travel. We know Juana will eventually become a victim, so the film becomes just waiting for that painful decline.None-the-less, a worthwhile film about an important artist and early voice for women's rights who is sadly under-known by much of the world. 
tt0092030;  This is another movie to put on the ALRIGHT chart. Scottish-born Maxwell Caulfield and Star Treks Nichelle Nichols go down to the woods and get a big surprise. No, not Jason, ZOMBIES! A force that has brought back the dead confederate soldiers to wreak revenge on some recruits. The direction isn't up to much, the story is quite shoddy and the characters are wimps apart from the 2 listed above. The scares of being chased through the woods are quite enjoyable and the shoot-outs are quite good. But to be honest, I've seen more gore in Scooby-Doo than in this! 5.5 out of 10.  
tt0092030;  I am a huge fan of zombie movies, so, when I found this one, I jumped to the chance of renting it. And then I knew I made a bad choice.The movie is about a group of army recruits being led into the backwoods by their head sergeant, Uhura from Star Trek. And I'll be damned if this wasn't another sequel to those Police Academy movies or something. From that marching band music, to goofy acting, to constant joking, and so on, I was really thinking this was like the 8th sequel, "Assignment in Alabama" or something. And that wasn't a good sign.Eventually, some "supernatural" stuff starts to happen, relating back to some flashback of a kid walking through a minefield with all these Confederate soldiers, only to have all of them blown away, except for him. A very cheesy scene. There's this woman the group finds, and apparently, they have no questioning as to who she really is, or what she's doing there. She's just with them now.I was starting to fall asleep until finally some guy got killed by two zombies in an underground bunker. Then there's that, "We've found a body, now let's find the killer" scheme until finally, that night, there is...yes...a shoot-out between zombies--which we barely ever see--and the recruits, who are getting killed left and right. But it's no bloodbath.There's a lot of scenes with this one guy and the zombies, while Uhura and some other chick hide behind rocks with a few other survivors and shoot at zombies. It was all really lame, until the terrible ending that had nothing resembling a climax. And then it ended. We saw an equivalent of ten zombies in the whole movie, uninteresting deaths, and basically no horror. Skip this one. It's not only a bad zombie movie, it's a bad horror movie in total.
tt0092030; I remember seeing this one as a kid but failed to remember much else from it. Now I know why: Not much happens in it. The only few merits it has, are the neat ghost story concept (Return of the Civil War Zombies) and some commendable attempts at creating atmosphere (mainly with the use of lighting and fog). Too bad the rest of the film is a dud. It's like it wants to, but can't, really.The zombies appear to have cool make-up effects, but it's hard to tell because you hardly get a good look at them. It sort of plays out like a supernatural slasher movie in the woods. The teenagers here are simply replaced with a bunch of military soldiers in training (or something). Either way, they all still act like teenage boy-scouts. A lot of them do get killed, but never in exuberant ways. THE SUPERNATURALS might still be worth a watch if you fancy this type of typical 80's stuff, but make sure to lower your expectations.I really wanted to like this film a bit more, this second time around. But it just remains a flawed movie. If it would have had at least a slightly higher pace and a bit more memorable death-scenes, I would have been more forgiving. Now, I'm just very sorry. 
tt0092030;  I've read some pretty extreme (both positive and negative) reviews for this movie, but it's really a very middle-of-the-road affair. It's directed competently enough to keep you from feeling that you totally wasted your time with it, but it's also so derivative that it can even be called a ripoff (especially of Herschell Gordon Lewis' "Two Thousand Maniacs", it has practically the same plot). The opening sequence is the best. (**) 
tt0092030;  The Supernaturals is pure 80's cheese.  It's corny, has terrible acting, and is full of stereotypes (the nerd, the black guy with the radio, and the horny white guy for starters).  So why then do I like this movie?  Is it because of the Star Trek alumni (Uhura and La Forge), the best Abraham Lincoln impersonator I've ever seen, or LeVar Burton's sinister mustache?  None of the above.  It's because The Supernaturals is one of those movies from my childhood.  I saw it years ago and it just grows on you.  It's extremely cheesy, but likable.  It's a non-traditional zombie/ghost story and that alone should make zombie fans want to see it.  There is a lack of gore, however, the zombies look cool, when visible.  Actually I don't know why this movie is rated R.  Maxwell Caulfield is always great too.  He is a fine example of wasted B movie talent.  The Supernaturals is worth at least one viewing. 
tt0092030; There was this sad, short period after the first Good Trek films came out and before we got saturated with bad Star Trek TV shows that the actors of Star Trek tried to cash in on their names in cheap films.This was one of them.Nichelle Nichols plays an Army Sergeant bringing a small group of troops out to the middle of the woods. Which never actually really happens in the Army. They immediately encounter the zombies of Confederate Soldiers who proceed to pick them off like nice plot device monsters.And that's kind of it.Nichols is the only thing anyone can remember in this movie, and the word we are looking for is "miscast". 
tt0092030; I didn't like this movie although the premise is really good. These post-war zombie movies are very popular and this one is very decent. If done correctly, this movie would have the status of a respectable zombie movie. The cinematography is really good and plays a key part in the most important scenes, for example, the ending.The f/x are really are cheesy but work for the movie's purpose. Still I can't recommend this movie for it's visuals... in fact, it's a boring movie with a lot of wasted potential.Watch it only if you get it for free. I catched it on late cable many years ago and I can't say that I regret about it, but I wouldn't watch it again!Try "Stryker's War" for a more entertaining movie in the likes of this one. 
tt0092030; I was moderately excited to see this one, after all the premise is rock solid. New army recruits doing training manoeuvres in the woods encounter undead menace from the American Civil War, with a cruel flashback opening and the suggestion that strange things persist in the area all set expectations high. Then there's the lively acting and reasonable writing that give off the impression in the first ten minutes or so that this is going to be pretty solid stuff. Sadly as the film goes on the pacing slows to a crawl and the feed of interesting moments and mild spooks is all too slow, which combined with the lack of grue or plot development make for an experience that is two thirds stodgy and kinda tedious. For a lot of the first hour I was looking at my watch, which isn't ideal. The effects are good and there are some nice moments, but director Armand Mastroianni puts things across in largely uninspired style and worst of all the film mostly isn't weird or incompetent enough to deliver unintentional humour or oddball kicks. Acting wise there are a few perks. The big draw is seeing Nichelle Nichols (in a rare film appearance) and LeVar Burton together in the same film and as a big fan of Star Trek: The Next Generation and a minor fan of the original series I was pleased to see these two together, with both putting in good performances. Nichols perhaps was not the best choice for a tough leader but she still does pretty well. Also, Maxwell Caulfield does reasonably as the nominal hero and Talia Balsam is both likable and easy on the eye as a female recruit. The woodland is a good setting and when watching it helped that I am a huge fan of backwoods horror, but the film only really takes wing in the final half hour delivering a smart dose of interest and thrills that lift the film somewhat but still can't make it overall that good. In the end I wasn't too dismayed by the whole affair, but it still isn't terribly good. Far from the worst out there, but still a film that i would only really recommend to backwoods horror and zombie completists, as most others will likely find it too weak. 
tt0092030;  'The Supernaturals' is one of the most sinister horror films to come out of the 1980's. The location for this zombie flick is aptly used: somewhere in the 'sullen backwoods' of America. We are, at first, introduced to a regiment of Confederate soldiers who are forced, by the Union forces - the 44th -  to walk across a section of woodland laced with mines. The entire regiment are blown to all four points of the compass, with the exception of Jeremy, a young boy dressed as a confederate. He, along with his mother, exhibits a seemingly unearthly power, which consequently saves his life. Fast-forward to the year 1985: a troup of U.S. soldiers - the 44th division - are on manouvers in the same backwoods. Little do they know what atrocities befell the original regiment of the 44th - until they unwittingly camp upon the same cursed ground. Radio contact fails, troops begin to disappear during their routine watch - all hell breaks loose, as the past catches up with the members of the 44th. The woods serve as an appropriate setting for this creepy horror movie, and there is - despite previous reviews - enough gore to keep the average horror fan entertained. However, what makes this film stand out from other zombie films, is the tight plot and the faultless directing. The use of the mist-shrouded woods, the 'seemingly' disused underground bunkers and the ancient stone cottage - now a haven for the long-dead - create an eerie atmosphere. The sharpened tree branches see members of the 44th staked - vampire fashion. Mawell Caulfield (Sundown: The Vampire in Retreat, The Boys Next Door, Gettysburg: Waxwork 2: Lost in Time) shines, as ever, in this horror masterpiece!  
tt0092030; This opens with a scene from the civil war as a unit forces an enemy unit through a minefield where most of them die. It then jumps to the present day where a group that shares the same regiment number is doing maneuvers in the same area. These horny dope smoking fools are lead by Sgt Hawkins (Star Trek's Nichelle Nichols) and are really just a bunch of misfits in uniform. After a long period of time, the dead regiment is stirred awake as zombies/ghosts and begin their revenge on the group of army fools. The slow going plot and idiot characters make the first part of this movie challenging to stay with. Writers Joel Soisson and Michael S. Murphey don't give director Armand Mastroianni much to work with as everything in this production seems very flat. Special effects artist Mark Shostrom does provide some cool looking zombie/ghosts and there is some gore to speak of. There are some touches of atmosphere and a few creepy moments but they come way too late to save this mediocre horror film. Nichols should have stayed on the Enterprise

tt1424366; SPOILER WARNING!It is somewhat trendy these days to be 'sustainable' and 'emission free'. Ratanaruang caught this topic very well and expressed in 'Nang Mai' impersonalizing nature into a pretty young lady (the super-hot Thai actress Porntip Papanai) who suffers from the evil humans. The impersonalization is a little vague and incomplete yet the message is clear: do not hurt the nature or it will come back to you. Those who remember Pen-ek's movie 6sixtynin9 probably remember the moment where the girl gets attacked in her apartment by the gangsters and the TV is swhiched on showing some fellow talking about how important it is to "stop cutting down trees...". I believe the topic is not accidental and Mr. Ratanaruang must be a strong supporter of environmentalists which he wanted to express in his movie. My respect for that. We must protect our nature and understand the broader impact of that. I feel sorry for those who didn't quite get it and thought this was an 'ordinary' horror movie. It's not a horror movie and it's not intended to be so. 
tt1424366; In a beautiful and riveting opening sequence set in the midst of a Thai rain-forest we are thrust straight into the overall tone of the movie. The whole six minute scene is made in one take, where the camera is seemingly detached from the action and only stumbles upon it from time to time capturing a rape scene and several minutes later the perpetrators are lying dead in the water.From this we are transported into the lives of a town-dwelling marriage of well-off professionals May and Nop. As in the opening sequence there lives are detached from each other only occasionally touching each other as if almost by chance. Nop is engulfed in his photography as a means to escape his failing marriage, whilst May finds solace in the arms of her coworker Korn. Without much enthusiasm May and Nop plan an escape into the wilderness and go camping in the forest. Even here in the midst of nature and cut off from other companionship they hardly intertwine and seem to exist separately. Until one night Nop wanders off in the forest only to disappear...Extremely consistent in eeriness it captivates the senses. Much thanks to the camera-work, which is terrific and beautiful stuff, albeit most of it is made with a hand-held camera making it almost reminiscent of "Blair Witch Project" (albeit with way better results). Given that this movie almost watches like a horror film it must be noted, that it is much more than just a typical genre movie. It remains creepy throughout shying away however from actually being a shock thriller or Asian horror.The ending leaves much unexplained and it would probably help a lot to be better acquainted with local mythology. Without it you can assume various plot points, but are ultimately left with many questions unanswered that seem solely cultural. Additionally the version I saw seemed to be missing a significant portion of the last 30 or so minutes and various situations seemed to have not been filmed or cut out. That said the version I watched lasted 93 minutes, while IMDb gives the Cannes copy a 109 minute runtime.All in all I found movie captivating and inspiring, although somewhat slow and drags on unnecessarily at times. The ending is not entirely satisfactory and slightly bland, but I admittedly preferred that it left so much to self-interpretation. Made a significant enough impression on me to search out other Pen-Ek Ratanaruang movies and note him down as an auteur filmmaker. 
tt1424366; I spent a lot of my childhood poring over classical mythology, to a nerdish extent. So nymphs of all sorts are very interesting to me, one of my favourite paintings is John William Waterhouse's Hylas and The Nymphs, I find myself thinking of it when I'm in the dentist's chair, a happy place to go to! I've also become acquainted with the darker side of the tradition as an adult, for example Ezra Pound's poem April.Simply put, this film should have been right up my street. The opening scene of the film indeed was very interesting, something I enjoyed a lot. There's a scene in Philippe Garrel's experimental movie Le rA©vA©lateur where the characters are fleeing across a landscape and the camera separates and meets back up with them later on in the scene. It reminds me of ice dancing, where the couple who are skating split and rejoin. That's how the first scene of Nymph works in cinematographic terms, where here the eerie Thai forest is the landscape. So that's a success.From there on the movie unfortunately went downhill. The couple in this film, Nop and May are completely flat-lining in terms of interest, they flop through the movie as if they've just awoken from a coma. We don't get any sort of sense of why they are attracted to each other, the acting is not expressive at all, the film unfortunately becomes boring.I'm worried about the level of control Ratanaruang had on this movie, because it seems to fall into fairly boring and generic horror movie tropes, and I find it hard to believe that he's done that on purpose. I felt almost like I'd watched Ring 3 by the end of it such were the boredom levels with such a tired and clichA©d movie.The secrecy and furtiveness with which the nymph was filmed were (a flash in the corner of the eye now and then at the start), in my opinion, totally unnecessary, worn out stuff that you could see in Blair Witch Project, or really any generic horror movie.I felt that there was enough good material here to edit into a highly successful short. But no way was there enough for a feature film. The ending, painfully, was really rather silly. 
tt1424366; The wrong film at the wrong time. So my expectations are slightly to blame, having read it was a drama/fantasy, I thought it would be a nice film for a Sunday morning. How wrong I was! The fantasy is very light, and could just be described as weird. It all starts fantastically enough with an amazing shot. The camera pans through a woodland as though itis searching for a story to tell. It soon comes across two men chasing a woman. We then hear breathing and realise this shot is the perspective of someone/something. It seems to ignore the events and soon rises higher and higher, making it obvious this is no human. As it looks down we see the two men, dead, in a river. This one shot contains more excitement, thought, and technical brilliance than the remainder of the running time. Nymph forces you to suffer through endless glaring at trees and shots of people with flashlights gradually turning around. It's a painfully tame and tedious film. 
tt1424366; Nang Mai (or Nymph) wasted 2 hours of my life. The movie starts out with what feels like a 10 minute clip of some guy walking through a forest with a camera Â<U+0096> okay I do admit I do feel the director putting a lot of effort into the scene, shooting the entire thing in one takeÂ  but obviously he's not going to repeat this first-person biology-watching nature trip again and again right? Turns out I was wrong. The entire movie more or less consists of a long and tedious trip through Thailand's wonderful forests! It looks and feels as though as Pen-Ek Ratanaruang has a man-crush on Stanley Kubrick and wants to come up with his own Thai version of the 2001 Space Odyssey, except with this one he'll shoot 80% of the movie in one day, having actors mindlessly walk around in circles in a forest then sticking bits in to create a ridiculous excuse of a plot! His forest scenes contained absolutely NO development and puts Andy Warhol's "Sleep" to shame -- the director is too busy striving to make a strange and unusual movie in hope of creating something "unique", that he forgot to make it actually watchable. The only enjoyment I got from this movie was the seemingly random sexual bits, and Cherry Berry.I felt cheated after walking out of the cinema and want my 150 baht and my 2 hours backÂ  not mentioning how disturbingly misleading the preview was. If you felt cheated after watching this excuse of a movie like I did, you have my sympathiesÂ  if you have not seen this movie yet, then for the love of Pete don't make the same mistake that I did! 
tt1424366; Alright. So I saw this movie with my husband and a friend while we were in Thailand with English subtitles. I wish I had a camera to record and show you the abuses they were mouthing after seeing this movie. They thought it was going to be a horror. Although the movie was confusing and slow and "arty" (but not really in a good way) I will try to give you a fair review below:It starts out in a unique way, with a long, one cut camera shot in the jungle, about 4 or 5 minutes. There is little to no sound, just the occasional breathing and the rape scene in the distance (you never really know why that was in the movie in the first place, it never ties in and the rapists end up mysteriously dead and that's where the scene cuts, no sign of the girl that was being raped).As the movie progresses you meet the characters one by one. There is little to no talking in the movie. The few lines that there are in the beginning give away what is to be the theme of the movie...I think. They talk about evil spirits and not in much detail. About 1/4 of the movie is gone by the time some action happens in the movie. Until now, it had just been silence in establishing the affairs between the characters and the job of the husband, Nop. From here on out it is just confusing. There are lots of suspenseful scenes, as a lot of it is shot as a lone girl going through the jungle at night following scary sounds, but ultimately it is not a horror movie and no ghosts jump out at you. Oh and nothing happens. Ever. Much ado about nothing. There is a ghost in the story (maybe, you never really get to know for sure), the ghost of Nop, which appears as a normal person who drinks a lot of water (implying that somehow he has turned into a tree). Again, just kind of weird. The end is resolved by the affair ending for good as requested by the ghost/alive Nop (can't be sure). Summary: Not a horror, but has suspenseful scenes, confusing as hell, not much dialogue and what little dialogue there is does not add to the understanding of the movie, not much background music which means most of the movie is in a semi-silence.I rated it a 3 because I have to give credit to the fact that this movie actually was conceived, directed, and some how ended up in theaters, despite the fact that is the weirdest thing ever. Most movies leave you feeling someway or another, this one just left you with a ?.Comment from my husband: Don't pay lots (or any amount) of money to see this movie. Unless you really have nothing better to do and need to kill time, but be sure though because this "time" you will never get back in your entire lifetime and the movie will leave you wondering, what the f*##???? I mean for crying out loud they're screwing personified trees in the movie. Enough said. 
tt0040982; In New York, the spoiled Diana "Dee Dee" Dillwood (Joan Fontaine) is an indecisive millionaire that has broken with her various fiancA©es. Her uncle and her psychiatrist convince Diana to get married with Henry Benson (Willard Parker) and they go to a fancy hotel. Meanwhile the pilot Marvin "Marv" Payne (James Stewart), who owns an air flight company with two old airplanes with his friend Bullets Baker (Eddie Albert), lodges in the wedding suite on the next door of Dee Dee and Henry expecting to rest to fly to California on the next morning. Dee Dee flees from the wedding night and hides in Marv's room. She uses a strong sleeping pill and on the next morning, she does not wake up. Marv and Bullets take her to the airport and she convinces them to take her to California with them and a chimpanzee, a soppy couple that has just married, an embezzler with a wallet full of money, a coffin with a body, and frozen seafood. After a storm, passenger and crew are stranded in a farm of a hospitable family where Dee Dee learns that the she will find her true love when she kisses the right man. "You Gotta Stay Happy" is a delightful screwball comedy with James Stewart and Jean Fontaine that show wonderful chemistry. I saw this movie yesterday and I laughed a lot with the funny situations, especially when the poor Marv wants to sleep and is interrupted many times. It is amazing how Hollywood does not present a tribute to Jean Fontaine (96), to her sister Olivia de Havilland (97), to Maureen O'Hara (90) and to Lauren Bacall (89) and any other actor or actress from the Golden Age still alive in the Oscar ceremony. Ms. Lauren Bacall is still filming but it would be heartwarming to see Ms. Jean Fontaine, Ms. Olivia de Havilland and Ms. Maureen O'Hara reunited again, after all those years. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Not Available 
tt0040982; By the time "You Gotta Stay Happy" rolled around, the motion picture career of James Stewart (my personal favorite actor) was in a slump, and this picture did nothing to alter that. Adding to the difficulty was the fact that screwball comedy had been a trend a decade earlier in the late 1930s. What's more, Joan Fontaine, who admittedly did not want to do the picture at all, was ill throughout the filming and discovered she was pregnant. She fondly remembered how Stewart was the only one who visited her at the hospital.Be that as it may, "You Gotta Stay Happy" is nevertheless an entertaining film, and here are the highlights (watch the film first before you read on). Twice in this picture, pilot Marvin Payne (Stewart) has a run-in with attorney Henry Benson (Willard Parker), the camera does not focus on Henry, but a punch is heard, and the camera shifts to Marvin lying flat on his back. The cigar-smoking chimpanzee named Joe (quite a bizarre spectacle on film) puts on a show while Marvin and his happy-go-lucky copilot Bullets Baker (a perfect role for Eddie Albert) make preparations to get their freight plane out of the mud. The night of the wedding, Henry and Diana "Dee Dee" Dilwood (Fontaine) come into conflict in their hotel room, and their loud bickering and clumsy chasing disturb Marvin, who is trying to sleep next door, Dee Dee escapes and flees into Marvin's room, where she develops amorous feelings for him, but the next morning things get complicated for Marvin when both Bullets and hotel manager Dick Hebert (William Bakewell) enter the room to find Dee Dee doped up by a strong sleeping pill. There is perhaps a slight touch of suspense as Marvin and Bullets make their emergency landing on the farm belonging to Mr. Racknell (Percy Kilbride), he is kind enough to let the stranded crew of six spend the night at his farmhouse with his expansive family. While they do, Bullets joins in a lively dance with a few others and Dee Dee is especially thrilled at the sight of the eight or ten little children lining up to kiss their mother (Edith Evanson) good night."You Gotta Stay Happy" failed to turn in a profit for the box office and did not give James Stewart the career boost he needed. But it is still a pleasant little comedy, and Stewart need not have worried much longer, for his next picture, "The Stratton Story" (1949), became a big hit and a precursor for the most successful decade of Stewart's career: the 1950s. 
tt0040982; You Gotta Stay Happy was produced by William Dozier who at the time was married to Joan Fontaine. I think Fontaine was trying to lighten her image a bit and decided to try this throwback comedy involving a missing runaway heiress. Very familiar territory from the Thirties, postwar audiences wanted a little more realism. Anyway she was able to land James Stewart as her leading man and he even accepted second billing here. Well, in affect she was the boss on this set. And they got a good cast of familiar faces from past screwball comedies to help this along.Watching this, I couldn't help thinking that Joan Fontaine was going into territory Jean Arthur knew by heart. If Arthur was the heiress, this thing might have been a classic. This picture would have been so right for Jean Arthur.I particularly enjoyed Percy Kilbride playing Pa Kettle under a different name. He's a farmer with a tribe of kids in Oklahoma where pilot James Stewart and his animal, human, and vegetable cargo have landed. Eddie Albert as Stewart's co-pilot and sidekick is also just fine.It's an enjoyable comedy, but it will never be in the first rank of films of either Fontaine or Stewart. 
tt0040982; Though screwball comedies like Bringing Up Baby and It Happened One Night had run their cycle by World Way II, Universal was persuaded to try it again with this frothy story about runaway heiress Fontaine escaping her stuffy groom for the charms of pilot Jimmy Stewart who is running a shoestring flying service. Stewart's finesse with this genre shows as does Eddie Albert's as yet another snappy best friend. Fontaine is more sweet than brittle with a comedic line, but thanks to a great supporting cast like Porter Hall, Roland Young, Percy Kilbride, and a cigar-smoking chimp,You Gotta works pretty well. The frantic pace relaxes more than it should when the cast gets airborne, but this is a very entertaining film of its kind with more than a few laughs. 
tt0040982; Though "You Gotta Stay Happy" came after the heyday of screwball comedies, it follows the recipe well enough: take one zany heiress, mix up with earnest hero, add wise-cracking best friend, toss in some comic stereotypes for support, add a dash of innocent deception to get the plot rolling, then a pinch of mistaken identity (or something like it) to keep things stirred up, and top off with some chaste romance. Bake (or half-bake) for a little over an hour and a half, garnish with a cigar-smoking chimpanzee, and... voilA ! Enjoyable light entertainment. You may be hungry an hour later, but it's fun while it lasts.Jimmy Stewart's Marvin Payne is a variation on the actor's patented good-guy persona: a decent if sometimes cranky pilot, he's trying to keep his ramshackle airline *and* his carefully crafted life-plan running smoothly. Joan Fontaine, proving surprisingly proficient at comedy, plays indecisive rich girl Dee-Dee Dillwood, whose antics seem calculated to throw Marvin off schedule in both arenas. And Eddie Albert, as "Bullets" Baker, shines in an early and excellent incarnation of what would become his trademark 1950s character-- the lovable sidekick.It's hard to outline the plot without giving it all away-- partly because all the pieces are intertwined, and partly because there aren't all that many pieces-- but I'll try. Fontaine's running from the altar, and Stewart, not fully aware of her circumstances, is somehow persuaded to let her aboard his cargo plane. Meanwhile, co-pilot Albert has enterprisingly sold seats to a few other unauthorized personnel. Will our intrepid fly-boys manage to steer their two-engine plane through stormy weather to complete all deliveries and stave off bankruptcy, or will they be too distracted by the fact that the police seem to be looking for one of their illicit passengers? And how about Stewart's heart, which seems to be flip-flopping for Fontaine a full six years ahead of schedule (he's penciled in "love" for 1954)? Will he be relieved or upset, if and when he learns her full story? It'd be too much to say that "the plane lifts off and hilarity ensues," but I was both amused by the proceedings and invested enough in the leads to care whether they got their happy ending. A warning: some of the aforementioned comic stereotypes-- naive Native Americans, women content to stay in their place-- haven't aged as well as others, so put on your 1940s hat before popping in the DVD. 
tt0040982;  Well, this wasn't "It Happened One Night" but, the plot line was similar. Rich girl (Joan Fontaine) secretly hops aboard a transport plane to escape a loveless marriage. Jimmy Stewart, the pilot, finds her and is annoyed to have a pretty girl hiding on board. In Hollywood guys always get mad finding a pretty stowaway, yeah, right. Anyhow, after a plane crash and lots of hanging around, nature takes over ... and you know... Actually, I enjoyed it. A little escapist comedy, that managed to entertain. Eddie Albert is good too, as Stewart's side-kick. I'd rank it a respectable 6 1/2.   Also, Fontaine is as always, very feminine.  
tt0040982;  I think this movie is charming.  It is part farce and part whimsy.  It is not a great comedy, and I don't think it was ever intended to be.  It has a few stereotypical characters, but that can be fun.  I have seen the movie several times.  It is pure escapism. 
tt0040982; There are going to be a lot of modern audiences who find Jimmy Stewart's pilot character to be the epitome of a male chauvinist. He balks at the thought of working for a woman, let alone being married to his boss. That's the story here of when he encounters the wealthiest orphan in the world (Joan Fontaine, whose character claims to be 26, is actually 28, as played by an actress who was really 31), having just married the most boring man in the world. She's changed her mind, the groom slugs Stewart, and after the briefest of all attempts at a honeymoon, Fontaine runs into Stewart's hotel room and refuses to leave. Of course, after taking three sleeping pills, it is going to take more than dynamite to get her out of bed, but if Stewart and his co-pilot pal Eddie Albert have their way about it, they will.Joan Fontaine, in one of her few comic roles, is extremely funny as she slips and slides out of a chair and Stewart's arms while under the influence of these pills. Stewart and Albert agree to take her as far as Chicago, but along the way, they pick up a newlywed couple as well as a clerk who is wanted for embezzlement. It's "It Happened One Night" in the sky where a corpse, a chimpanzee and a bunch of fish ready for filleting are accompanying this mixed group of passengers. Then, when the plane hits bad weather, it's down it goes, right into the front yard of hick Percy Kilbride, his non-Marjorie Main wife (Edith Evanson), and their brood of 10 kids (and they've just started!). You know the minute a record player in the bridal suite begins to play "Hold That Tiger!" (which Kilbride always seemed to discover playing on his radio whenever he turned it on in the "Ma and Pat Kettle" series), you're in Universal territory, especially when Pa Kettle's Indian friends are the ones who show up to pull the plane out of the mud. The fact that this came out as the same year of "The Egg and I" proves this point, an ironic fact of free publicity in movie history.There's lots of funny moments here, especially the shot of the cigar- smoking chimp, embezzler Porter Hall getting all misty-eyed at the presence of a baby in his arms, and the battle of the sexes between Stewart and Fontaine. Marcy McGuire, the pop-eyed ingA©nue of a series of RKO musicals of the war years (and got the first screen kiss from Frank Sinatra), plays the new bride who sneaks a ride aboard the plane, while Vera Marshe is Hall's floozy secretary who runs off with him and the stolen money. This is a late screwball entry in the Post World War II era where comedies were more topical yet not always entertaining. You will be consistently entertained here. 
tt0040982; This movie is certainly not a deep or memorable movie. In fact, I just saw it again for the second time and I had forgotten so much of it--even though I saw if for the first time only a couple years ago.Jimmy Stewart is the owner of a very tiny freight airline. During a stopover, he is accidentally united with Joan Fontaine who is running from a brand new marriage she hasn't yet consummated to a man she didn't love. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that sooner or later, Stewart and Fontaine will be a couple, though the rest of the movie consists of a series of wacky adventures until the ultimate conclusion.So why give the movie only an 8? Well, first, Fontaine's character is rather annoying and highly reminiscent of Julie Roberts' character in RUNAWAY BRIDE. Someone that ditsy and self-centered, for me, is a little hard to really care about and you aren't really pulling for the leading man to take this shallow woman. Secondly, and more importantly, the movie has way too many contrived and "wacky" subplots--a guy running off with his company's funds, the chimpanzee who loved Fontaine and smokes cigars, the Southern-fried humor supplied by the young couple from Georgia, etc. It just seemed REALLY, REALLY contrived. Plus, the dialog itself was rather forced.So, overall it's just an adequate film--best enjoyed by old movie and Jimmy Stewart buffs. 
tt0040982;  This is probably James Stewart's worst film.  His co-star is Joan Fontaine, who never was adept at doing light comedy, she and Stewart have no chemistry together whatsoever.  They get no help by the pale script and the pacing of the film is very slow.  A dud.   
tt0100688;  I first saw this movie in 1991...pretty much the same time it was released to video store.  It was a little too violent for me back then and made me a bit uncomfortable (I was just a kid).  I just watched it again (I bought the tape through Amazon)...and I have to admit that it has stood up pretty well. It is a rather dark story but it has some rather interesting and creative kill scenes.  Also watch for the forensic detective...he has some pretty funny comments about the murders.  It is a pretty original movie...definitely B grade but worth a look.7/10   
tt0100688; Steel and Lace is a cool, inventive take on the revenge thriller/gore. Farino has directed a modern gore/thriller. I think this is the Pulp Fiction of its time. New concepts and turns of fate abound in this puzzling film.A cute blonde lawyer is raped in an alley by a Wall Street Geico type character. He goes to trial and gets off from lack of evidence. He and his 4 buddies own a corporation that has a logo of a hand that is squeezing the world in a claw like grasp. (neat logo) Not being able to cope with the devastating news, the lawyer jumps off a building. Mysteriously, the Wall street crowd is then killed one by one in Ten Little Indians, style. The director, Francio, really integrates a pastiche of film genres into an action/thriller/gory film that is way above other gore films. A lot of works are derivative to a fault, but this one integrates a lot of genres into a well crafted/shot/edited/music film.I kept thinking, Death Wish, Gort, Hal, Spit on your Grave, Terminator and other films that were reverently depicted in this surprising film.The actors and good and production values top notch...considering that this was probably a low budget film, this was an excellent example of good direction and control of the production. I like the way the robot gradually gains awareness about her actions.Look for it in bargain bin, rental stores, and on cable TV. It is a neat discovery. 
tt0100688; A brilliant scientist, Albert Morton(..renowned character actor Bruce Davison, providing his usual solid performance)resurrects the memory of his dead sister, Gaily(Clare Wren, cherubic when she isn't giving her victims the cold stare of doom before executing them)who committed suicide after her rapist attacker, Daniel Emerson(Michael Cerveris, perfecting the confident scoundrel)was found not-guilty by a jury due to "insuffient evidence" thanks to the scumbag's four best friends, who testified on his behalf(..and were actually the ones responsible for holding the poor girl down as Daniel molested her), by creating a cybernetic killing machine modeled after her. A sketch artist, who worked Gaily's trial, Alison(Stacy Haiduk, balancing a mousy but hot sex appeal) is coerced by her agent, Duncan(Nick Tate)into returning to her old job, a project dedicated to the ones involved in the trial of Gaily. Alison attempts to rub elbows with old flame, Detective Dunn(David Naughton)hoping he'll help her get close to those who were sketched by her during the trial of Gaily, soon discovering that the ones responsible for the rape are being hunted down and murdered in grisly, unusual ways. Driven and determined, Alison will become obsessed with the case when Duncan is killed during an encounter with Gaily..we come to understand that Albert is behind the scenes commanding her to kill and no one is allowed to interrupt the mission of destroying those responsible for that suicide from five years ago thanks to injustice. Meanwhile, bodies start to pile up with Daniel and those that remain grow more concerned and restless. Can Dunn and Alison stop the blood shed or will Albert complete this cycle of revenge in the memory of his beloved Gaily.I'm a sucker for the "human cyborg" sub-genre, and this little movie suitably entertained me. The practical effects might seem primitive next to a film like Steven Spielberg's AI, but I admire the imaginative methods of destruction such as a spinning drill that cuts a hole all the way through one victim while another's head is removed from his body. The funniest death isn't really overly gory, but appropriately tongue-in-cheek as one victim's body is sucked dry through his pecker. Fans of Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD should enjoy one victim's skull getting split apart by a helicopter propeller. As many of these movies used to be, the villains(..Daniel and his cronies, now businessman in suits swindling good people of their property in criminal ways to plant malls where they live)are loathsome and lecherous as you root for their destruction. The pace is excellent, even if the story's formula is familiar(..five thugs, behind a heinous crime they got away with, facing violent death for their actions in bloody fashion)..director Ernest D Farino keeps the film moving, with emphasis on the revenge story wasting no time of needless filler which doesn't contribute to the motivations of the characters and the situation. It's no surprise that this is the kind of film, having a visual effects background, Farino would make, because the story involved hi-tech(..for 1991)devices used on victims. Many would watch STEEL AND LACE now and probably criticize the effects because they don't necessarily hold up to the advancements of this modern age, but if I had watched this as a kid teenager I would've been thrilled. The story is far-fetched(..could Albert really pull off such a concocted plan, and wouldn't Daniel have a security force around him as protection?), but the audience gets to see slime annihilated in very creative ways..a classic story of revenge with a robotic twist on who is conducting the series of murders, a genre movie all the way. Kind of a tragic and sad conclusion that doesn't allow Albert to get away scot-free, and interesting development showing the cybernetic version of Gaily evolving, desiring to understand emotion and feeling. My favorite visual effects sequence would probably be when Albert is opening up the skull of his cybernetic creation, with the director allowed to show off his skills regarding her robotic brain and the inner workings involved with making her function. 
tt0100688; Out of the all too numerous and all too familiar rape revenge films, "Steel and Lace" emerges as different and clever. This is no "Ms 45", but is definitely better than a lot of lesser exploitation movies. The acting is pretty good, with David Naughton and Bruce Davison best. The story is more than just blood letting, with the rape victim brought back as a cyborg and methodically terminating her tormentors. Her kill methods are somewhat creative, my favorite being decapitation by helicopter blade. Even though this was never intended as anything more than splatter, it has some welcome dark humor in the mix. "Steel and Lace" is a keeper. - MERK 
tt0100688; Steel And Lace is still one of those horror movies that isn't out on DVD or Blu Ray. It was made in an era when horror was not done but this here does deliver some good moments. The story is very simple, a rape/revenge flick with a sci-fi twist. Being raped by five thugs who are released without conviction, Gaily (Clare Wren) can't take that no justice is being done and decides to jump of a rooftop. Being death her brother Albert (Bruce Davison) resurrect his sister being a robotics expert. Her new body has the capacity to change her face and seduce the victims one by one to prepare them to die. It's the graphic deaths that makes this watchable and even enjoyable. There's a decapitation that's worth picking up. Still this is pure exploitation made as I said earlier in an anti horror era. David Naughton (An American Werewolf In London fame) stars as the detective going out to find what's happening with the victims. Gore combined with some small nudity makes it worth picking up if you still got your good old friend the VHS player at home. Gore 1,5/5 Nudity 1/5 Effects 2/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5 
tt0100688; *SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*I bought this video. There's just something about the tagline, "She's all woman...and all machine.", that speaks to me. Actually, it shouts at me. The video screamed, "Why are you not watching me?!". I had to obey."Steel and Lace" is about a Robobabe on the rampage. A hot blonde rape victim kills herself after being denied justice. Her scientist brother won't let those filthy rapists get away with it. He creates a new, hi-tech version of his sister: Robobabe. His robot sister embarks on a mission of truth, justice and dismembering lots of rapists.I enjoyed this one. A killer woman robot causing havoc. That's enough for me. She had a lot of different options for wasting rapists. I especially enjoyed the weed whacker springing out of her chest so that she could drill for oil in the guy's stomach. Now that's how you take care of business. 
tt0100688; Stars Bruce Davison (X-men), David Naughton (An American Werewolf In London), and Claire Wren as the rape victim/suicide turned killer cyborg. The story is rather unsettling, especially the way it careens back and forth between the dark revenge scenes, over to some fascinating comic bits (such as the forensic scientist who starts to enjoy the creativity of the murders), to dealing with Davison's character, who seems more like a robot than the robot. Perhaps it is unsettling because juxtapositions like that are so often a hallmark of real life as it is lived. The viewer really is kept in suspense about how the next victim will be claimed, and I defy anyone to guess all the deaths correctly beforehand. The dialogue verges on self-parody at times, and elements of several other flicks from Blade Runner to Robocop are borrowed with little attempt at disguise. Yet it all hangs together somehow, perhaps it is the thread of bad romance. A quirky gem. 
tt0100688; When super-evil businessman Emerson (Cerveris) rapes a sensitive concert pianist named Gaily Morton (Wren), and thanks to the false testimony of his buddies/baddies Norman, Craig, Oscar and Toby (Backer, York, Lieber and Burkholder, respectively), Emerson gets off scot-free at the trial, and poor Gaily commits suicide. Luckily, her brother Albert Morton (Davison) is a creepy and obsessive robotics technician. Albert rebuilds Gaily but this time outfits her with cool weaponry and a drive for revenge. She then goes after the team of evildoers that wronged her. Meanwhile, Detective Dunn (Naughton) is on the case of the mutilated men. Thanks to the help of his girlfriend Alison (Haiduk of Yesterday's Target (1996) fame) - who is an artist and was working as a courtroom sketch artist at the time of the original trial - Dunn is closing in fast. But will Dunn stop the Morton siblings from completing their revenge mission? Or will Emerson and his gang get away with it? Find out today! Steel and Lace sports a very cool concept: a cybernetic rape-revenge thriller that crosses Robocop (1987) with I Spit on Your Grave (1978). The whole outing is perfect for the video stores of the early 90's. Movies like The Terminator (1984) and Eve of Destruction (1991) were renting heavily (OK, just go with us on that last example) - so why wouldn't you want to see a beautiful woman getting revenge on some baddies and boring through their chest cavities with a robotic drill? Any teenager would have been thrilled, and now any teenagers-at-heart should equally appreciate what Steel and Lace is trying to do. The end result is entertaining and enjoyable. You gotta love it.Cerveris is appropriately boo-able and hiss-able as the ponytailed main baddie. As if rape, extortion and racketeering weren't enough, he's just not a very nice guy. It's kind of a dead giveaway that you're evil if the logo for your company is a globe with a sinister-looking hand clutching it, done up in an ominous shade of red. And you spend a lot of time in an "evil boardroom" (you'll know it when you see it). It's all part of the comic book-like fun. Let's not forget we're dealing with a cyber-revenge robot chick. On the side of the good guys we have not just the reliable David Naughton, but there's a wacky M.E. named Herb that almost steals the show. (if there is a wacky M.E. on board, odds are his name will be Herb).Our hats go off to SOTA FX for creating the robot and gore effects which were, well, effective. Released by Fries Home Video, iff you liked Peacemaker (1990) - which was also put out by Fries - you'll surely like Steel and Lace. We recommend it. 
tt0100688; So the setup is a pianist is raped by a rich guy and his four friends lie for him. She is so upset she kills herself in front of her brother, a creepy NASA robotics scientist.Who somehow turns his dead sister into some kind of killer cyborg including a death drill and a castrating device in her... well, you just have to watch, as she proceeds to exact revenge on the five guys.They throw in a cop and his court artist girlfriend so you have some normal people in this film to relate to, I guess.There's a fairly large continuity error where the Cyborg (which disguises itself as other people until she's ready to strike) takes the role of a secretary in the office. Except she's at her brother's home AND the office where her victim is at the same time. Maybe. Or she just assumed the identity of the secretary (they mention a secretary was killed), but that still didn't make sense since the Brother and the Cyborg would have had to make it to the office before the Court Artist did.Still, not a bad film, because back in the 1980's, when they did a movie like this, they came up with actual plot ideas rather than just recycling the same tired old Zombie Movie formula. It wasn't a big screen release, it was something for video-stores to put on their shelves. 
tt0100688; Steel and Lace starts in a Los Angeles courtroom where general all round scumbag Danny Emerson (Michael Cerveris) is on trial for the rape of Gaily Morton (Clare Wren), the verdict is in & Emerson is acquitted due to lack of evidence & the testimony of four of Emerson's friends, Toby (Scott Burkholder), Oscar (Paul Lieber), Norman (Brian Backer) & Craig (John J. York) who all gave him a false alibi. Gaily is devastated, she feels let down, cheap, angry & used as Emerson walks out of court a free man. Gaily makes her way to the courthouse roof & before her brother Albert (Bruce Davison) can stop her she commits suicide by jumping off it. However Albert happens to be a hotshot scientist & manages to bring Gaily back to life as a part human part robot cyborg, with one aim, to gain revenge on Emerson & the men who lied in court for him. Los Angeles detective Dunn (David Naughton) & his artist girlfriend Alison (Stacy Haiduk) are on hand to try & figure out who is responsible for the ever-growing pile of dead bodies...Directed by Ernest D. Farino I thought Steel and Lace was an OK time-waster but nothing particularly special. The script by Joseph Dougherty & Dave Edison has a neat central premise but it fails to deliver the goods on too many occasions. For starters Emerson is nowhere near villainous enough, we never see him rape Gaily & most of the film he comes across as a slightly dishonest property developer which meant I never really got behind the cybernetic Gaily & her revenge mission as much as I would have liked, his four mates are even worse as beside lying in court for him they don't do anything else at all. I also thought it was too slow & pedestrian between the revenge segments which are few, I'd have liked a much bigger body count. I mean when you look at the plot synopsis & see that it's a film about rape, death, revenge, murder & killer cyborgs you just think that it's going to be slightly more exploitative than it actually is. Basically the rape scene is none existent & the revenge scenes aren't much to shout about either, Death Wish (1974), I Spit On Your Grave (1978) or MS. 45 (1981) this ain't. Having said that it's still watchable, it's reasonably good fun & there are one or two amusing (intentional) comedic moments in it & I quite liked the ending.Director Farino doesn't do anything special & it sort of looks a bit like a made-for-TV film, it's a bit static & dull to watch. No mention of how Gaily was brought back is made, she just shows up as a killer robot which seems to skip a somewhat major plot point but I doubt anyone is going to watch Steel and Lace for it's writing or intricate plot. There are a couple of decent scenes & some nice gore, someone gets a drill through their chest which leaves a rather big hole, someone is decapitated & a cool Dawn of the Dead (1978) style scene when someone has the top of their head chopped off by the spinning blades on a helicopter.Technically the film is OK but nothing special, the special effects are actually decent. The acting was alright & there are a couple of familiar faces here.Steel and Lace is a decent time-waster, it's one of those films which I thought was fine but nothing spectacular & I'd have probably forgotten about it by the end of next week. Worth a watch for sure but don't lose any sleep if you haven't seen it already. 
tt0093346; This is a film about a guy who thinks his wife is cheating on him, so he kills off a bunch of people while having flashbacks of his wife doing these awful things. The main character cuts a girl's head off and tosses it from a really tall height, and it lands on a guy and kills the guy. She must have had a REALLY hard head. Also, check out hilarious deaths involving chainsaws and lawnmowers and splattered entrails and the like.For whatever reason, all the characters come back to life as ZOMBIES at the end... uh, yeah. If you're into serious horror films, you'll probably hate this. The movie is surprisingly NOT played for laughs, though it's way too ridiculous to take seriously most of the time... But, anyway, I liked this film a lot, and I think you will too. 
tt0093346; After viewing Killing Spree at least a dozen times I still cannot get enough of its skilled acting and great special fx. Killing Spree should be considered a cult classic and has many useful quotes such as "I've just got to do something about these bills" and "Screw my wife, I screw drive your head!" Asbestos Felt effortlessly pulls off the role of a paranoid lunatic, by making his wife quit her job then sending her to live with her mom so he doesn't have to worry about her or her safety you start to realize his delusions know no bounds, in order to understand his mind you must know somebody whom you can relate to the character he is playing. Killing Spree should be viewed and enjoyed by many :) 
tt0093346;  This is so far from the mainstream that I can understand that not many people will like it. I,however, like this sort of flick. And as far, as no-budget indie horror flicks go, Tim Ritter is THE MAN. And this is definitely, my favorite of his movies. If you did not like this you will definitely hate his other movies, but if you saw 'Truth or Dare' or one of his other movies and thought it was cool then check this one for sure. It's got great gore effects, a rather cool plot twist and, like most of Ritter's flicks, as the goriness surmounts, the plot thins in almost a surreal manner which still today has me wondering if it was meant to or it just turns out that way.... 
tt0093346;  KILLING SPREE is a low-budget horror flick that was shot on 16mm film.  The intent of this movie is not to give you a brilliant story, although this one does have a good twist and some radical zombies returning from the dead at the end.  No, the whole reason for its existence is to showcase outrageous "splatter effects" that were so popular in the '80s. While they may not be top-of-the-line, they do hold a special place for fans of this genre. Within KILLING SPREE you will find some of the most creative "kill sequences" ever committed to celluloid!  Not since DAWN OF THE DEAD has there been so much over-the-top humor and glee in showcasing this kind of phony gore.  So take it for what it is.  If you're a fan of movies like BAD TASTE, PINK FLAMINGOS, and BLOOD FEAST, you will appreciate KILLING SPREE.  
tt0093346;  This is a classic 80's horror flick. Cool gore from Joel Harlow, who is now a big time FX artist. The DVD looks great and I am happy to see it availible for a new generation of gore fans. It has everything a fan wants from a Tim Ritter movie: good story(humorous) and good gore. 
tt0093346; I recently got this flick on DVD and from all I've read about in other reviews was really anxious to see it. When I was done I was very surprised. They don't make movies like this anymore! I guess the greatest thing about this is that it doesn't try to be that serious "which is evident during the head scene and the zombie finale" and it doesn't get so goofy that you don't even understand it. Heres the plot newlyweds tom russo "Asbestos felt" and Lisa "Courtney lercara" move to a new neighborhood and for a while everything goes alright. Except for toms nosy neighbor. But then he thinks his wife is having affairs with his friend and visitors. So he starts to kill them one by one. And the last fifteen minutes feels like your on a bad acid trip. This movie features several creative deaths like the screwdriver and clawhammer deaths. "gotta love the ceiling fan death" and fellow gorehounds will not be disappointed. mild bad acting but a great soundtrack even though it features the lamest porno music I've ever heard makes this an independent classic you must see. 
tt0093346; That's right... back in 87 I was in a rock band called Lights Out. Some friends of mine were making a movie and needed a band to help with the bar scenes. OK... so we move all the equipment, set up, play a few tunes...only later to find that the audio equipment failed and our music was not recorded. An amazing and lucky break! (At least we got a credit at the end of the film) But seriously, I observed the process of making this movie, and you have to admire the sheer "stick-to-iteveness" (is that a word?) of these guys to make a movie with absolutely no budget. I would say that the movie has a certain charm to it... but I am clearly biased. Some of the stuff they did, from a special effects standpoint, is pretty good... especially considering the money limitation.The other surprising thing to me is that at least 17 people have seen this movie. (As of this writing, there are 17 reviews posted). To me, this movie is almost like a performance piece. That is... the act of creation is where the artistic part lives.... the movie itself is a by-product of the art. An artifact really. (It's sort of like the ashes left behind after someone walks across burning coals).You have to encourage this kind of creative effort. (I Think...?) 
tt0093346; I know that many people will/have automatically given this film a rating of 1, just because it doesn't have the huge budget and top-of-the-line special effects that they are used to. I, however, knew what I was getting myself into when I popped this into the VCR.I don't think we get much more low-budget that this, unless we are filming a family reunion. The lighting is awful, sound quality is at times incomprehensible, and the acting is ultra-bad by almost all involved. BUT, this is still a fun movie and the plot is interesting enough. It centers around a fellow named Tom Russo (Asbestos Felt), who has been down on his luck with his job. He is very protective of his wife and does not allow her to work, putting even more pressure on himself. As he begins working more hours, we see him slowly transcend into madness and obsession and he becomes suspicious that his wife cheating on him and begins to brutally murder the various men (most repair guys) that he feels are responsible. I must say that the gore effects are extremely cheap, but fit with the overall tone of the film.. The brutal ways that Tom Russo comes up with to murder these men gives us an idea of just has mad he has become. The pacing of the film is also very good and there is rarely a boring moment. The ending really doesn't follow the rest of the plot of the film, as it seems to want to go from a psycho-slasher film, to a "Dawn of the Dead" wannabe, but it is entertaining nonetheless and I must give Tim Ritter credit for wanting to use an unconventional ending. I can honestly say that I enjoyed this film, but it is by no means a good film, if that makes sense. It's budget is its main stumbling block and the consequences are almost too much to overlook. I DO NOT recommend this to people who are totally spoiled by the big-budget movies and who can't have an open-mind to ultra-low budget films. You simply won't enjoy it. For others, and fans of gore--I say give it a shot. You will find at least SOMETHING redeeming in it! My Grade: D 
tt0093346; This move is amazing - Asbestos Felt as Tom Russo, he just blows my mind. His acting is understated and a real powerhouse performance. And Courtney Lercara makes a fabulous Leeza Russo, with just the right melange of subtlety, seductiveness and secrecy.The turning points and key scenes are marked by the ingenious use of lighting, coupled with marked changes in the musical score. Many characters, such as Mrs Palmer, have unique theme music, adding to the sense that this movie was something special to Tim Ritter, the director. His signatures, such as subtle references to other cult horror movies like Evil Dead, make this revealing vignette into 1980s Floridian life all the more touching.I recommend this to anybody who enjoys aged fine wines, foie gras and acid jazz. 
tt0093346;  If Killing Spree has one thing going for it, it would have to be the ingenious killing methods used throughout the movie. Where else can you find machete ceiling fans? Definitely for fans of low-budget 80's horror films that were really cheesy, yet very enjoyable. Utterly hilarious dialogue and over-the-top characters make this movie memorable. Interesting choices of camera angles and lighting effects.Not everyone will "get" Killing Spree. I could see why someone would think this was a waste of a movie. It is not for everyone however, it is obviously for a small niche audience.Fans should be aware that there are two DVD versions for Killing Spree on the market. The first one is a bare-bones unauthorized bootleg (the cheapo). The quality on it is okay, but there is no menu, scene selection, or anything else for that matter. The other version that recently came out from Sub Rosa is the official authorized DVD edition. It has a much nicer transfer and includes a great 90-minutes documentary/behind-the-scenes with an introduction from scream queen Debbie Rochon. Also included are two feature-length audio commentaries with director Tim Ritter on the first one. The second audio commentary is with Asbetos Felt, Joel D. Wynkoop and R.M. Hoopes. 
tt1210356; When you look forward to watch the next outing from the trio namely Rajat, Vinay and Ranvir - the expectations are nothing short of "Bheja Fry" to least to speak. Especially if you give it a topping of Saurabh Shukla helming the affairs, there is absolutely no room for going astray.The good news is the product works and the sad news is only in parts. The narrative is unique and keeps the audience intrigued however there seem to be lapses at various junctures. Performance wise the entire star-cast have delivered a spectacular performance. The beard doesn't deliver the impact of the usual "suave" Rajat look. He seems to be straight out of "Siddharth" sets.Vinay role as a bosom buddy was okay'ish. Required more depth. In addition, he "fit" looks he sported for "Straight" seems to be waning and it shows.Ranvir hardly contributed with his jibes about "Austraaliaa".Neha Dhupia seems to have developed a penchant for the character since "Ek Chaalis Ki Last Local". Ecdysis warranted asap. Dilip Tahil character was over-emphasised. The "Jack out of the box" was as big as a bus.Irawati, Dilip Tahil, Anu Menon, Navneet Nishan - all did a great job there.Verdict: Not a bad watch if aired on telly. 
tt1210356; Rajat Kapoor camp has given us some memorable offbeat flicks in the past (remember mithya and mixed double!!). So I had pretty high expectations from RGBG which I feel sorry to say did not meet them fully. The movie is not too disappointing, it has its funny moments and a good ending, but it seriously lacks in the script and screenplay. Though the end is surprising, the first half does not generate much curiosity about "What the hell really happened last night between Rahul and Sophiya?". A few more twists in the tail and a tighter screenplay could have done the job.The movie scores well in most of the other aspects. The actors are at their best, especially Vinay Pathak, Navneet Nishan and Ranvir Shourey (he creates magic even with such few scenes). Neha was amazing as a 'totta' and I am glad she is emerging as a fine actor with movies like Dasvidaniya, Ek Chaalis, Maharathi and RGBG. Iravati is a refreshing entry in Rajat's camp and I hope she stays. The background music is good, could have been better.Overall, it is a nice watch for multiplex crowd, but not the kind of stuff you expect form the ensemble. 
tt1210356; So, I love the cast & they perform well. Saurabh Shukla has tested his hands in directing & I feel he has achieved what he yearned with a fine adult comedy which sometimes, gasps for fresh breath.The plot revolves around two 3 families & how a party they spend the other night together in, turns out to play havoc in their lives. Rajat Kapoor is suave as always as the husband who has experiences a short- span memory lapse. It advances as he goes on to find out what happened that night to finally end up in a comedic situation with his friends. Certain surprise elements barge in to give a humorous effect. Lots of vulgar references which did lack punch but give you a light-hearted time.Mostly, it talks about adultery & how one should see it/handle it.BOTTOM LINE: Overall, a fine drama which does stick to the emotional side towards the end. Recommended for a one-time watch due to the wits, slapstick & real-life relations.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NOProfanity/Sex: No | Mouth-Kiss/Vulgarity/Nudity: Mediocre | Violence/Gore: No | Smoking/Alcohol: Strong | Drugs: No | Porn: Very Mild 
tt1210356; One of the finest actors of Hindi cinema, Saurabh Shukla Directs 'Raat Gayi, Baat Gayi?'. And luckily, Shukla has made a fairly entertaining rom-com, that doesn't fail to impress.'Raat Gayi, Baat Gayi?' Synopsis: Following a wild party, a married man meets with his friends in order to try and remember his indiscretions.What makes 'Raat Gayi, Baat Gayi?' work is its simplistic story & the characters it has. While the protagonist is good, the supporting characters appeal as much or even more. Especially the character played by Neha Dhupia. Its a well-written character! Shukla who also Wrote The Story & Screenplay along-with Rajat Kapoor, makes sure there is movement in the narrative. Though slow-paced & dull in parts, the film works otherwise due to the interesting sequences it offers. Shukla has Directed the film well. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are okay.Performance-Wise: Neha Dhupia excels in a meaty role. She delivers her best performance to date. Rajat Kapoor is perfect as the protagonist. Vinay Pathak is remarkably credible, as always. Dalip Tahil is in top form. Iravati is effective. Anu Menon is equally good. Navneet Nishan is adequate. In cameos, Ranvir Shorey & Aamir Bashir leave a mark.On the whole, 'Raat Gayi, Baat Gayi?' has genuine merits. 
tt1210356; After a long gap, comes an impressive and entertaining offbeat flick talking about the extra marital affairs in a comical manner. An intelligent satire on the ever changing relationships of 3 married couples and their reunion, it is not a usual cup of tea for every lover of Hindi Cinema. In fact the movie is strictly for adults and the multiplex viewers who can easily understand the overdose of English conversations included in its narration. And though it revolves around the memory loss of a particular night and its happenings, still it is not a remake or an inspired version of the English Hit "Hangover" as expected.It's a comeback movie of writer-actor-director Saurabh Shukla, which excels with its impressive performances, funny dialogues and realistic take on the High Society culture and its famous parties. The story revolves around a weekend party where all the characters are there interacting with each other. Rajat Kapoor arrives there to attend the party along with his wife Irawati and their kid girl. After a few drinks he gets attracted towards Neha Dhupia, who is also there in the party with her boyfriend. They both start with some casual talks and end up being in a room all alone. Now the next morning when Rajat wakes up, he cannot exactly remember what had happened last night and he is still confused that whether they both did 'it' or not. From here, starts the actual mix-up where everyone starts blaming the other for his undisclosed and awkward position.In actual terms, "Raat Gayi Baat Gayi" is not a loud comedy with over the top sexual sequences as seen in some recent lousy comedies. On the contrary it's a smart and intellectual kind of movie which more or less depends upon the entertaining verbal conversations between its characters. It's indeed a treat to watch the husbands & wives talking bitterly about their spouses and then later repenting upon their own remarks and feeling sorry for it. In simple words, the movie entertains in its first half where everyone is lovingly teasing each other in the party and then remarkably enlightens its viewers in the second half when the characters move on to the path of their self-realisation.The most entertaining scenes include the ones where Rajat Kapoor & Vinay Pathak are discussing the one night stand with each other. Later Dilip Tahil joins in, making it even more hilarious and absorbing. Besides that, Saurabh also softly points out towards many famous social superstitions like Feng- Shui and Tarot Reading through some intelligently written scenes in his script. And the last half an hour of the movie, when all the confusions are being cleared about that particular night, proves as a perfect ending for a well directed movie based on the uncontrolled human relationships.If you loved the artistic kind of movies made in the 70s & 80s, then you will readily appreciate the efforts put in "Raat Gayi Baat Gayi" accompanied by many superlative performances to enjoy. The best act comes from Rajat Kapoor and Vinay Pathak, which gets equally supported by the sizzling beauty, Neha Dhupia who looks too hot in her revealing outfits. Rest of the cast includes, Dalip Tahil, Irawati Harshe, Anu Menon, Navnit Nisshan and Aamir Bashir, who also provide many funny and amusing moments for the viewers. To complete the team lead by Rajat Kapoor there are few special cameos too made by the well known, Ranvir Shorey, Marakand Deshpande and the renowned director Sudhir Mishra.Interestingly both Ranvir and Marakand have the two most hilarious scenes in the script where Ranvir is talking about his innovative "Kukkad" dish and Marakand is showing his palmistry skills to a lady. Musically the film has nothing exceptional to offer with Ankur Tewari's musical score mainly working only as a fine filler. Cinematography is captivating with expressive close-ups, soothing lighting and innovative colour schemes used in the backgrounds.Incidentally, "Raat Gayi Baat Gayi" reminded me of another realistic gem called "Party" (1984), which also revolved around a similar get-together sequence involving several characters from the richer section of the society. The 80s masterpiece was directed by Govind Nihalani and it seems that the movie was somehow there in Saurabh's mind while writing the script of his current venture. The climax was also pretty close to Rajat's own movie on wife swapping with the title "Mixed Doubles" released in 2006.Summing up, 'Raat Gayi Baat Gayi" is a well directed and superbly acted movie which will mostly appeal to the thinking viewers who love the realistic, offbeat and artistic kind of cinema. Go for it if you are a fan of this particular genre. 
tt1210356; Raat Gayi Baat Gayi? Means is meaning gone if night is gone? Not really, if you are a married man, you were with a bombshell in a cocktail party last night and can't remember a thing in the morning. So you gotta wake- up and find what happened last night? This movie is a mini satire on high class society, their two faces, one for public and one for personal life. Directed by Saurabh Shukla and played by few good known names like Rajat Kapoor, Vinay Pathak and Dilip Tahil, the movie never looses you in its less than two hours length. At the end, bad characters come good and good as bad ones and you understand that everything is not what it seems, every chatter box is not a fool, every intellectual person is not honest, independence does not mean not listening to your mind and anything can happen to anyone in this funny life. Enjoy this small satire for its honest characterization and lovely messages to keep your love intact. 
tt1210356; I had somewhat mediocre expectations from the film. But I was utterly disappointed as to my expectations from this film was particularly high after the lot like Mithya and Dasvidania both by Vinay Pathak.Much of its storyline line has a very strong resemblance with the hangover. Though if u r a regular movie goer,u can enjoy this one as an adaptation of Hollywood's flicks!This is a well directed and superbly acted movie which will mostly appeal to the thinking viewers who love the realistic, offbeat and artistic kind of cinema. Go for it if you are a fan of this particular genre. 
tt1210356; Loved this movie and thought it would get more viewings with a better name. Guess the promoters/producers thought this cheap name would bring in more front benchers. Rajat why the beard??? Neha stop going over the top in slutty roles! Ranvir what were you doing in this movie?? Makrand- wanted to see more of you? Sudhir Mishra- nice look. Naveen - thank you for playing your age and not over-acting. Dalip - got more footage than you should have. anu/ Iravat - well played. Music was nicely complimenting the movieOverall an excellent growing up for Bollywood. Keep it up Rajat, nice follow-up to Bheja Fry. Do not succumb to mainstream cinema please... 
tt1210356; The team that gave us some amazing movies like 'Mixed Doubles', 'Mithiya' and 'Dasvidaniya' are now back with a new movie about urban marital relationships. Saurabh Shukla now occupies the director's seat and tells the story of three married couples. What really captured me about Shukla's direction is how he subtly portrays each couple struggling in their marriage. While it is clear that their marriages aren't working, Shukla cleverly peels the layers as he gradually reveals the reason. The subtle comedy is a plus even though the pace is a little slow in the beginning. The film also manages to capture the urban feel. The twist in the end, even though I saw it coming, is well handled.The overall performances are good. However, Rajat Kapoor doesn't exactly nail the part. Vinay Pathak is brilliant, even though this kind of character isn't anything new for him and writing required more depth. Dalip Tahil makes a welcome comeback and so does Navneet Nishan as the irritating chatterbox housewife. Aamir Bashir is adequate. Neha Dhupia is sensational and finally it is Iravati Harshe who delivers the best performance.The execution is pretty good and the soundtrack is terrific. Even if 'Raat Gayi Baat Gayi' isn't among the best of what the team has delivered, it is a nice effort on Shukla's part. He ought to direct more and I'll be looking forward to such ventures. 
tt0081148; Whilst being both the most visually and audibly haunting Angelopoulos film, I will remember it more so for covering most of the thematic concerns of Angelopoulos in his 40 years of film making:- The troubling foreign involvement in Greek political and cultural affairs - The failure of the Greek government to respond effectively to the crises presented before it - The rise and fall of the communistic ideal and the cult of personality - The burdens of the historical past upon individuals in the present- The deconstruction of the foreigner as savior (Oedipus, St. George, Kolokotronis, Jesus, Alexander) - The personal cost of living amidst contested geographic, political and moral borders - Journeying as a metaphor for the search for meaning - The nihilism in modernity and the struggle to forge a new way forwardIt's not his clearest or most coherent film, and probably shouldn't be watched until one is familiar with 'smaller' Angelopoulos pieces, but it is the film that resonates with me the most after having seen his body of work. 
tt0081148; Oh man! I hope I am NOT the 41st person in IMDb who get to this film. This was the Winner of Golden Lion and FIPRESCI Prize in Venice! This film is not about Alexander the Great(356-323 BC), but a mysterious rebellion in the beginning of the 20th century in Greek. It is full of extremely graphic beauty, wonderful scene attempting, imaginative symbols, and, of course, convincing long takes. Even better than the heavenly Ulysses's Gaze. It is said to be the successor of the trilogy Days of 36, The Travelling Players and The Hunters, but to enjoy this film one does not have to take a Greek History lesson first, seeing this film would at least be one of your most unforgettable visual experience, and its metaphysical power would stick inside your mind for a long long time. Highly recommended. Get hold of this when you could find it,open your DVD-Rom and your mind, and that would be a revealing journey. 
tt0081148; Continuing his epic explorations of Greek history in the 20th century, Angelopoulos goes back to the turn of the century, where a charismatic rebel leader calling himself "Alexander the Great" takes a handful of visiting English upper class young lords and ladies hostage, in an effort to win back the land that was taken from the farmers by and bankers. But, of course, in an Angelopoulos film things are always more complex than they first seem, and Alexander, while charismatic, is also madly ego driven, and encourages a cult of personality around himself. Returning to his home village, which is experimenting with Utopian Communism and shared wealth, Alexander is seen first as a hero, fighting to help the people achieve their dream society, but eventually he becomes a tyrant as cruel and arbitrary as any master. This is a central theme Angelopoulos is exploring. Creating Utopian socialist societies almost always demands people of power and military action, but those same people (almost always male) almost inevitably corrupt the experiment because of the nature of who they are. The very thing that makes them enablers of a new order also dooms them to destroy it. This film has a much more straightforward narrative than Angelopoulos' 2 preceding 'history' masterpieces, "The Traveling Players" and "The Hunters". Unlike those films, It doesn't jump around in time, and we stay pretty focused on this one specific incident, in this one specific village. And there is a downside to that. At 3 hours and 19 minutes, the film isn't complex enough to stay as fascinating as its progenitors. It's full of great images and wonderful, often painfully tense scenes. But on a meta level it's pretty easy to guess where it's all going, and it can get frustrating waiting for it to get there. Still an excellent film, partly based in truth (although the incidents actually happened in the 1870s), but it lacks the multi-layered magic of the two films that proceeded it. It also is generally far more naturalistic, so that when the magic and surreal suddenly come up, they can feels out of place and un-integrated. One thought. It's very interesting to compare this and Bertolucci's "1900", which I just re- watched recently. They are both long, epic films by European masters set at the turn of the century, and exploring the class struggle, and the domination of the farmers and workers by bigger more powerful forces. Both are very strong films. "Alexander" is the more subtle, complex, intellectual, and thought provoking, "1900" the more entertaining and emotional. Both are flawed,but well worth your time. 
tt0081148; The more I see of Theo Angelopolous' work the more convinced I am that he was possibly the greatest director in the history of the movies and yet at almost 3 1/2 hours long "Alexander the Great" is not an easy film to sit through. You know while watching it that he could have made a much shorter film if he had wanted to without sacrificing any of the plot but Angelopolous is a man who likes to hold shots even when nothing much is happening in them, in other words he gives you time, (and lots of it), to take in the action or lack of it. This, like so much of his work, is a film told almost entirely in images rather than words and every shot is composed for the maximum dramatic effect. Working again with cinematographer Ghiorgos Arvanitis there are images here as fine as any in cinema. Even if the film does seem overlong it is always visually stunning. The Alexander of this film isn't the great Greek warrior but a bandit who has kidnapped a party of English aristocrats and holds them to ransom while at the same time taking over the village commune in the mountains where his presence is virtually that of a warlord. As with other Angelopolous political films this, perhaps unfortunately, tends towards the polemical rather than the dramatic. The aristocrats, for example, are used purely as props and even Alexander himself is more of a figurehead rather than a character in his own right. Angelopolous' habit of shooting mostly in long-shot means we never get close enough to any of the characters to really get to know them. Here we have a film in which there are only groups rather than individuals and narratively this is a difficult film to follow. Time and again I lost track of who was doing what to whom. Perhaps this is why, however great the film looks, it is never the historical epic that say, Visconti's "The Leopard" was. Yet this remains a considerable achievement. Films, particularly epics, this rigorous don't come along very often. This is a film that demands a great deal from its audience but stick with it and you will be amply rewarded. Like all of this great director's work it is a film you will take with you and brood over for a very long time. It may not be his greatest film but even Angelopolous working just below his best is still stands head and shoulders above his contemporaries. 
tt0081148; Theo Angelopoulos is a controversial filmmaker. His films are hailed by many as grand and poetic and by many others (Roger Ebert for one) as trying and pretentious. The films of Angelopoulos have played a part in my own life. In 1999, as a young man with a minor in film studies, I took a chance, despite the mixed reviews, and rented Ulysses' Gaze. At the time, I was living with a friend who had a earned master's degree in ancient Macedonian history. He fell asleep about an hour into the film, but I stuck it out, hypnotized by the film's visual style and Harvey Keitel's performance. Ulysses' Gaze was unlike anything I had ever seen before. A few months later, I was fortunate enough to road-trip 250 miles to catch Eternity and a Day in a movie theater. I declared that film another masterpiece and well worth the travel expenses. I hungered to see more Angelopoulos films, but living in the rural Midwest my options were limited. I remember renting by mail VHS tapes of The Travelling Players and Landscape in the Mist from Video Library out of Pennsylvania. I liked both films, but did not connect to them as emotionally as I had Ulysses' Gaze or Eternity and a Day. Some time later, I bought an import DVD of Trilogy: The Weeping Meadow from Great Britain. It was another good, if not great, film from Angelopoulos. Then came a long, dry spell. A decade passed. My love for art movies did not exactly expire but did wane somewhat due to being away from film classes and not keeping up with what was being released. Finally, a British company released all of Angelopoulos' films in DVD box sets. At the end of last year, I bought all three sets. Alexander the Great is the second film I have watched from the sets. Neither grabbed me. I dismissed my reaction to Reconstruction as being the result of the film being a debut work, a filmmaker struggling to find his way in cinema. I approached Alexander the Great with high hopes. The story sounded intriguing and the film had won awards. Unfortunately, I found it to be a total bore. The narrative concern Alexander, a peasant leader, who leads a kidnapping of British dignitaries. Alexander takes the hostages to a mountain village that is being ran as a commune. Italian anarchists hear about Alexander and the commune and join. Meanwhile, the Greek government is nervous, being pressured by the British government to return the hostages safe and sound. Alexander demands that all the peasants' fields be returned to them and that complete amnesty be granted to himself, his men, and the community. These demands, particularly the amnesty condition, upset the government. As the situation stalls, a rift begins to develop in the village. Alexander is a great leader but his power begins to run counter to the communal nature of the village. Another reviewer compared Alexander the Great to 1900. Both films begin on January 1, 1900 and the theme of communal living runs through both. However, 1900 covers decades and is a more satisfying film. The main problem with Alexander the Great is length. There just is not enough here, in either scope or story, to justify the extended running time. After an hour, I gave up and began hitting the fast forward button. I doubt I could have gotten through the film any other way. Questions arise now that I have watched and been disappointed by both Reconstruction and Alexander the Great. If I re-watched Ulysses' Gaze or Eternity and a Day would they still strike me as masterpieces? Have my film tastes changed significantly in the decade since I last watched an Angelopoulos' film or are Reconstruction and Alexander the Great just dull movies, missteps by a usually good director? I can't answer these. What I can say is that a viewer needs to approach Alexander the Great with a great deal of fortitude. It cannot be watched casually. 
tt0271809; I received a copy of "Suspended Animation" in the mail earlier this week. It was postmarked from a company in New York, with attached sheets of paper naming the cast and crew, and an interview with the director, John D. Hancock, from Phantom magazine. I'm still not quite sure why I was sent a copy, and I'm not really that sure how I was sent a copy. I don't have any mailing address on my Website, and I don't have it listed publicly on the Internet. I can only assume the DVD was given to me so that I could review the film. But it's a puzzling affair of how that company in New York got my address.The movie was filmed in 2001 and given a limited theatrical release in October of 2003. I believe that the DVD I received is a preview DVD of what will hit stores some time in 2004. Perhaps the company in New York thought I'd review the DVD, too? I suppose I can, although there's nothing to review -- it has fine quality and sound, basic picture menus, and a single theatrical trailer. It probably doesn't need much more.The film is about an animator named Tom Kempton (Alex McArthur), and his fascination with his own kidnapper. It all starts when Tom and his buddies are out on their snowmobiles during winter. Tom gets behind and flips his snowmobile when he's trying to catch up, he seeks shelter in a nearby log cabin, which is home to a pair of strange sisters -- one rather obese and the other frail and sickly. They slip Tom a drug and he wakes up tied to a chair. It's then that he realizes the sisters are cannibals, and that they plan to make him their next meal. After making a daring escape with the help of his friends, Tom finds himself unable to move on with his life. He can't think of anything but the small sister, Vanessa, who kidnapped him and chopped off his pinky finger (which was successfully re-attached, or so I can only assume). Tom hunts down Vanessa's adopted child, draws her as a cartoon out of fascination, and eventually fights and helps murder her serial killer son, Sandor (Fred Meyers), who has a pimple-popping scene so stomach-turning it could rival the most gruesome horror films.The only thing worse than the killer getting up one last time for another scare is the two-killer theory. Here, it's a three-killer theory. There's a surprise twist at the end that leaves open one of three options: the remaining killer is one of the sisters, back from their graves, their brother, or Vanessa's daughter. And, if you're enough of a horror freak, you may even think it's Sandor coming back from the grave.I've got to say that though the surprise ending didn't surprise me, I was expecting something else to happen. I expected something much cleverer and much more startling than what did happen at the end. I had worked out a complex theory of who the real killer might be and it never happened. By the time the credits started to roll, I wasn't quite sure what the message of the film was. First it starts out as a sort of "Misery Redux," then it turns into "Deliverance" on snowmobiles, then it turns into "Single White Female," then it turns into "Psycho," then it turns into nothing. Is the point that the gene for wanting to kill people runs in families? Is it that you should not dig deeper into matters already resolved? Or is it just a wandering horror-thriller that isn't sure what it wants to be?The movie was penned by Dorothy Tristan, John Hancock's wife. It's based on her novel, which I have never heard of -- and now I can understand why. I'd like to give "Suspended Animation" a good review because I enjoyed the beginning as a sort of remake of "Misery," and I feel bad picking on a movie sent to me in hopes I would do the opposite. But if I followed that, it would be nothing but a bribe.I won't be totally unkind to the movie. John Hancock, the man behind Robert De Niro's "Bang the Drums Slowly" and the cult family classic "Prancer" (also very dark), directs well -- for what it's worth. And to be fair, "Suspended Animation" has a few interesting scenes, but the casting of Alex McArthur never helps much, and the flimsy script only harms what could have been a really tense and scary movie.2.5/5 stars. 
tt0271809; While traveling to fish in a frozen lake with two friends, the director of animated movie Thomas Kempton (Alex McArthur) loses his backpack and returns alone seeking it in the track. However, he has an accident with his vehicle and asks for help to two locals, the insane cannibalistic sisters Vanessa Boulette (Laura Esterman) and Ann Boulette (Sage Allen), and he is abducted by them. Later their friends kill Ann and rescues Thomas, but they are chased by Vanessa in her snowmobile. After an avalanche, Vanessa is considered dead by the law enforcement, but Thomas becomes obsessed by her life, tracking down her daughter Clara Hansen (Maria Cina), who was adopted when she was six and does not know her origins. Thomas gets close to Clara trying to disclose her past and gets involved to a dramatic family situation."Suspended Animation", a.k.a. "Mayhem", is a very weird B-movie, since it begins in a suspenseful situation that recalls 'Misery", shifts to a heavy drama and has a very unfair conclusion. I liked the unknown cast: Laura Esterman and Sage Allen are great in the role of the two deranged sisters, showing a stupendous black humor in the beginning of the story while telling Thomas what would happen to him. Maria Cina is very beautiful and has a top-notch performance in her dramatic role. I felt sorry for the unfair fate of her character and I did not like the selfish lead character, capable of jeopardizing the life of another person to save his own. This movie could be a little shorter, but anyway it is underrated in IMDb. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Mutilados" ("Mutilated") 
tt0271809; Tom is a Hollywood animator who heads out on a snow trip with some pals. Where he crashes his snowmobile and seeks refuge from two sisters, who just happen to be cannibals. But before he becomes dinner, his pals find him and rescue from this horror, but the police only find one of the bodies. 3 months later, Tom plans to make an animated feature about his experience and he learns that the police have discovered the body of the missing sister. But this ordeal has hit him so hard that now he's truly obsessed about the sister that he learns that she had a daughter who she gave up. Which she just happens to be an aspiring actress. So through work-related meetings he becomes good friends with her. He gladly finds out she has no idea about her real mother and his horrific incident, although he realises her teenage son has inherited his grandmother's evil frame of mind.Oh, what torture! Well, some scenes and dialogues were excruciating, but actually, I didn't think the flick was too bad, but again it was far from good. The fundamental problem was that it's overlong and there's just too much on the plate to congest. I found this independent flick an intriguing attempt in the thriller foray and there's some skill behind the camera, but the unbalanced material isn't a particularly successful mix. After what I thought was an okay opening 40-minutes that simply revisits "Misery" with its icy and isolated backdrop and a pair of kooky cannibalistic sisters, it just loses steam. The mid-section is very stodgy - by virtually becoming more of a character study involving the survivor Tom becoming infatuated by this whole ordeal and wanting to make something out of it by getting involved in one 'insane' family. It's one really strange fixation! But during this chewy period I found the story's progression rather colourless and the continuity lacking. So many details that are brought up are left unexplained or simply pushed aside. While, the dry dialogues really do stretch creditability and sometimes ramble on pointlessly. Although, a little of the sardonic humour helps a bit. The over-exaggerated climax isn't remotely surprising, but the constant use of three different endings was just too contrived. Every time I thought it was finished, something else was tacked onto the following scene.Now the performances would fit right into a soap operaÂ  say like "Passions". Pretty scratchy and at times rather hokey was the acting. Alex McArthur gives an understated performance, but Maria Cina as the daughter Clara Hansen is surprisingly good. Fred Meyers as the teenage brat Sandor Hansen is simply laughable with his angst and blimey, he has one real nasty habit. Angelo Badalamenti's score is extremely harrowing by playing around with many sequences and it gives the film a touch of elegance. The direction by John D. Hancock I could give the cold shoulder, but I thought he done an adequate job with what he had to work with. He staged one or two suspenseful and minor grisly scenes, despite most of it be telegraphed. But more often you could say I found it hard going and terribly clichA©-ridden to be entirely effective entertainment."Suspended Animation" takes on a systematic pattern that has a decent looking production, but the material is pretty much a scramble and saps most of the suspense right out of it. 
tt0271809; This movie (of which the title of my copy on DVD read: "Mayhem") started out so well: for the first half hour it's exciting, original and entertaining. The two cannibalistic sisters are a treat to watch, especially the fat one (Sage Ellen, she's very, VERY good!!!), they're played with a sardonic kind of humour and panache. Of course the whole situation reminds one of Misery, and even Dreamcatcher came to my mind, due to the snow, the cabin and the snow scooters. But still the story seemed to take it's own original turn, for instance I really liked the fact that there's no explanation whatsoever for the behavior of the sisters, which gives it exactly the creepy and inescapable feeling that is needed.Unfortunately, after the main character Tom Kempton (Alex McArthur) is saved, the movie sort of collapses, all the tension and pace evaporates in a sullen and overlong mid-section, where nothing much happens: the guy broods endlessly over what he had to endure by his tormentors and decides to stalk a supposed daughter of one of them. Here the movie takes an ill-fated twist. Apparently the director (Hancock) tried to give it a David Lynch-like broody and mysterious atmosphere, but alas, he's no David Lynch, and the goings on are not only boring but also very improbable. The only good thing about this part Â<U+0096> as about the whole movie - is the excellent musical score, which is no wonder, since the composer is Angelo Badalamenti, who composed the music for numerous great movies and (not?) coincidentally also did Mulholland Drive.The last part of the movie gets it again into a sort of thriller-mode, with wild attacks by psychopathic killers: the (grand)son that inherited the bad genes and the sister that miraculously survived, though it's never explained how. It's definitely too much, as if the director or writer had three alternative endings in their mind and decided to use them all one after another.It also seemed to me that there was much potential in the story that wasn't used to it's fullest by the writer. The bad son supposedly had done some hideous deeds of his own: it's disappointing that we don't see anything of it and the (circumstantial) evidence that's produced is hardly as chilling as everyone seems to make of it. His mother is a daughter of a cannibalistic killer, so why not let her, like her son, display some evidence of inherited evil?? And why not let the main character fall in love with the woman he stalks, I was all the time waiting for it to happen! That would at least have added an interesting layer to the story. Now it felt as if all potentially interesting story lines dead-ended or fell down with a puff.All in all it's rather an unbalanced movie, with a very promising start but a disappointing last 2/3. Mister McArthur doesn't really help, apart from his good looks he's not very convincing as an actor, at least in this movie, he walks around like he didn't much believe in the whole project himself, and the husky voice he uses in virtually every scene made him sound like he's in a radio play impersonating someone in perpetual sexual heat, it gradually annoyed the hell out of me! I did like Maria Cina though, she's beautiful and seems like a solid actress. And young Fred Meyers had exactly the repulsive looks and attitude that fitted the character of a psychopathic teenager. It's all the more sorry that both of them had to work on such a weak script. My final verdict: 4 out of 10 (but Sage Ellen gets a 10 plus!!!) 
tt0271809; With little knowledge or context, I was happily surprised by this film! It's thoroughly engaging, and I would agree with some other reviewers in that this film is fairly effective exceeding expectation and throwing in a good handful of unexpected twists & turns. Some of the negative reviews are surprising and seem quite ridiculous as this is flagrantly far from being the worst film ever made. Obviously it's not high high art, but that clearly isn't the intention. If ultimately you want something that entertains and engages, which seems to my problem as of late (in that entertainment isn't that entertaining these days)! This is a well done thriller. Enjoy! 
tt0271809; For a video nasty this was surprisingly watchable. The choice to examine the obsession with evil in the 2nd act of the film gave it a depth that few horror/thrillers in the low budget genre ever truly achieve. The basic plot is that a movie director is drugged and kidnapped by a pair of crazy cannibalistic sisters while he is on a snowmobiling holiday. Although he escapes, his brush with this evil leaves him obsessing with understanding what would make these women, particularly the dominant sister, Vanessa, become so twisted and warped. His investigation leads him to find Vanessa's daughter, Clara, a struggling actress with an abusive teenage son.The film doesn't revert to pointless gore but instead gives a thoughtful exploration of the quality of evil, beautifully examining the seeds of a serial killer and examining the idea of nature or nurture motivations. For the discerning viewer who doesn't just want a basic horror shocker, this film delivers some interesting ideas despite a few production and script flaws which can be attributed to small budget rather than small talents. 
tt0271809;  I watched this movie with little to no expectations and was very surprised at how much I enjoyed it. There is such creepy dark humor within the script that you laugh as you cringe. A crusty tale of backwoods cannibals, how can that be anything but entertaining? As if the sisters weren't bad enough, when the boy enters the picture we are treated to yet another level of twisted heredity. Fred Meyers as Sanders is probably the most disgusting personification of  "The Bad Teen" I have ever seen. Those zits!Thomas Kempton's last line is the perfect end to the numerous horror flicks we have all seen. Why won't they just die?!  
tt0271809; What struck me was the remarkable similarity of Fred McArthur-who played animator Tom Kempton-to Gene Kelly both in looks and voice. Its a typical film of today's horror genre where everything is thrown in and you get the impression they never knew how to end it. The cannibal theme was quite interesting but rather pointless as we only saw a pair of women who talked about it.Kemton,by this time tied to a wheelchair and pleading to be set free,suddenly found himself minus a finger as one of the mad sisters chopped it off.Later when he was rescued by his snowmmobiling buddies who'd gone ahead of him,the finger was "reattached" with sticking plaster though you had to assume he later went to a hospital. Placing Kempton there in the first place was the stock plot of going to the house for help after he crashed his machine Here though is where the story began to go haywire as the animator makes a film based on the mad sisters-he'd previously promised to put them in the movies if they let him go!! Next up comes a meeting with a woman who turns out to be the adopted daughter of the youngest sister-she agrees to be a model for Kempton's next production.She in turn has a son who gives insanity a bad meaning and hes suspected of being a serial killer when Kempton discovers a pile of rings presumably trophies kept from his victims. Its not really that frightening when you think of what happens in real life but if you watch this movie don't blink too much or you may lose the plot! The ending was the kind thats been used over and over again-the villains are presumably killed but still keep coming back.we have the landrover which gets bogged down in the mud-as a variation to being unable to start-and you think no way would Gene Kelly have played in a film like this-he would probably have found it difficult keeping up with the plot! 
tt0271809; I could not sleep so I turned on the TV and this seemed to be the only movie that got my attention, at first, it seems that the movie will end after few torture scenes or what so ever but there are huge twists in the history that makes this film remarkably good besides not having an unique history it does make itself unique.There are some actual stuff related to cannibalism such as it being heriditary and other sick stuff, the movie explores some bit of it but I didn't like so much how they introduced and put the history together, there seemed to lack an excuse to the main character be there and doing what he was actually doing.Despite it's bad reviews, it's a worthy and interesting movie to watch and it develops very well along the theme. 
tt0271809;  During the early passages of John Hancock's `Suspended Animation,' you think you've got it figured out: It's `Deliverance' meets `Misery.' But the pleasure in experiencing `Suspended Animation' comes from the way Hancock and his screenwriter, wife Dorothy Tristan, throw you a curveball, taking the film somewhere unexpected. If the first half of `Suspended Animation' reveals the very nature of evil, then the second act is about the obsession with it. Hancock and Tristan show how, for some, closure can't be reached until the evil that fuels relentless nightmares is confronted and dissected. The film stars Alex McArthur as Tom Kempton, a Hollywood animator with a beautiful wife, Hilary (Hancock veteran Rebecca Harrell), a stunning home, but a somewhat stalled career. Needing a vacation, Tom heads to northern Michigan for a snowmobile trip with two buddies, Jack (Dan Riordan) and Cliff (Jeff Puckett), but the excursion takes an unexpected detour when Tom's snowmobile crashes in the forest. Tom stops by a nearby cabin for help, only to fall into a trap set by two deadly serial-killer sisters, Vanessa (Laura Esterman) and Ann (Sage Allen) Boulette. They've killed before and are ready to make Tom their latest victim. Hancock and Tristan take almost fiendish delight in seeing how far they can go to make audiences squirm here, particularly since sharp objects are lying about, along with jars containing parts of the human anatomy no man would like removed. Tom survives the ordeal - after a dynamite snowmobile chase that features not just an ax, but an avalanche - but can't let go of what happened to him. He meets the sisters' brother, Philip (J.E. Freeman), who is doing time in jail, then tracks down the daughter of one of the sisters, Clara (Maria Cina), a waitress and aspiring actress whose son, Sandor (Fred Meyers), may have picked up a few nasty habits from his disturbed relatives. For all its squeamish moments, `Suspended Animation' becomes a fascinating glimpse into depravity and insanity. A bizarre, unsettling dynamic unfolds between the Boulettes, who foster a considerably warped notion of the concept of `family.' That leads to an impressively restrained, surprisingly quiet finale, where Tom witnesses the tragedy of the Boulette family unfold before him, even as his life, and that of his wife, are in danger. McArthur is quite good, `Suspended Animation,' however, belongs to the ladies. Esterman and Allen, as the two sisters, create a dangerous, at times hilariously unstable team. You're never sure when the two might explode, while Esterman, later on, takes Vanessa to another level, revealing a desperation that is sad and pathetic. Cina is a find. Her performance is so natural, so unassuming, it doesn't come across as acting. She's the most sympathetic character, the heart and soul of the film. `Suspended Animation' is one of the creepier films in some time, a superb example of taking a formula story and transforming it into the unexpected. Rating: 3 stars 
tt0069265; Co-directed by Chang Cheh, SEVEN BLOWS OF THE DRAGON (1972, aka THE WATER MARGIN) is an action-packed Shaw Bros. costume adventure based on incidents from the multi-volume Chinese literary classic, 'Water Margin,' aka 'All Men are Brothers.' The U.S. release version (which showed in American theaters in 1973) was, at 79 minutes, severely cut, leaving glaring gaps in the story and action. (With the news of the impending digital remastering of the Shaw Bros. library, we can now hope for a future uncut release of this title.) Still, it's worth seeing as an example of unabashed nonstop fighting and colorful historical adventure involving a host of characters from the Sung Dynasty, including the infamous band of 108 Outlaws, 'gallant men' who allied together to become bandits after political corruption and court intrigue made them wanted men. The focus of the film is on Master Lu, the famed Jade Dragon, who is imprisoned on trumped-up charges arranged by a devious steward having an affair with his wife. Members of the 108, including the boisterous, rotund Black Whirlwind, set out to rescue Master Lu and avenge the wrong done to him. Directing the official pursuit of Master Lu is his former friend and classmate, Golden Spear, who leads his forces into a climactic battle with the 108 and a one-on-one duel with Lu.There is lots of action and intrigue in a film that moves at a dizzying pace, with great fight scenes involving all sorts of exotic weapons (including Black Whirlwind's pair of battle axes), an all-star cast, and a surprising nude scene featuring Master Lu's adulterous wife. The lead players include Chang Cheh regulars Ti Lung, David Chiang and Chen Kuan Tai, along with Lily Ho (as Tigress), Ku Feng (as Welcome Rain), Fan Mei-Sheng (as Black Whirlwind), Wu Ma, and, in an unusual bit of casting, Japanese star Tetsuro Tanba as Master Lu. (Western viewers may recall Tanba's portrayal of Tiger Tanaka, the head of the Japanese Secret Service, in the 1967 James Bond film, YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, and his role as a government official in MESSAGE FROM SPACE.) Golden Spear is played by another Japanese actor, the lesser-known Toshio Kurozawa.SEVEN BLOWS OF THE DRAGON was followed by a sequel, SEVEN SOLDIERS OF KUNG FU, also reviewed on this site, with most of the stars returning, which detailed the further adventures of the 108 after they were pardoned by the Emperor and assigned to make war on rebel armies.ADDENDUM (October 6, 2007): Since I wrote the above review, the original full-length Shaw Bros. release version of the film, in Mandarin with English subtitles, has come out under the title THE WATER MARGIN, in a restored/remastered letter-boxed edition on both Region 3 DVD (from Celestial Pictures) and Region 1 DVD in the U.S. (from Image Entertainment). The R3 is 120 min., while the R1 is 125 min., a difference probably attributable to PAL-to-NTSC conversion for the R3. In any case, fans basically get approximately 40 more minutes of the story, with scenes that flesh out some of the characters and their relationships. An opening text crawl informs us that the film is based on chapters 64-68 of the original literary work.One of the special features on the R1 DVD is a one-minute-and-36-second "extended love scene" that was specially shot by Shaw Bros. for the dubbed U.S. release version and includes shots of a nude body double (for actress Ling Ling, who plays the adulterous wife of Master Lu) sharing the screen with actor Tien Ching (as Lu's treacherous aide) in the film's one sex scene. One important distinction between the original Hong Kong version and the English dub known as SEVEN BLOWS OF THE DRAGON is found in the music score, which was largely redone for the English dub, mainly to replace music cues on the original track that were lifted from Dominic Frontiere's score for the 1968 Clint Eastwood western, HANG 'EM HIGH, which was still fresh to many American moviegoers (and to lawyers for United Artists) when SEVEN BLOWS OF THE DRAGON was released in 1973. The original Shaw Bros. music score was patched together from a variety of different sources and sounds awfully arbitrary, with the HANG 'EM HIGH cues being particularly distracting, the only glaring flaw in an otherwise masterful Hong Kong costume epic.The film's sequel, reviewed on this site as SEVEN SOLDIERS OF KUNG FU, has also been released on Region 3 DVD by Celestial, under the title ALL MEN ARE BROTHERS. Also available is THE DELIGHTFUL FOREST (1972), newly restored as well, something of a prequel to THE WATER MARGIN, in that it shows what led Ti Lung's character, Wu Sung, to join the 108 outlaws just before the events of this film. 
tt0069265; Based on historical events of the 12th century, "Water Margin" tells the story of 108 heroes referred to (by their enemies) as the "Liangshan bandits". They want to fight against a corrupt government, and therefore they ask 2 famous fighters to join them. These 2 are reluctant at first, but get into trouble with the so-called law very soon. Thus they don't really have freedom of choice anymore."Water Margin" is a fine example of Eastern classics produced by Shaw Brothers who got a cast full of stars together including Tetsuro Tamba as Master Lu. The best role, however, went to David Chiang as his right hand man Yen Ching, the Young Dragon. With irresistible charm, he defeats anybody - from pretty ladies to fierce fighters. The movie begins slow, introducing countless characters, but becomes very powerful and gripping in the second half. One recurring theme of the musical score seems to be inspired by Carlo Rustichelli's music for "I quattro dell'Ave Maria", which reminds the audience once again how often western movies and kung-fu cinema influenced each other. "Water Margin" was later followed by the sequel "All Men Are Brothers". 
tt0069265;  This movie was released in the US in the mid-seventies as Seven Blows of the Dragon as there are seven bandit warriors, though barbaric, are considered the heroes. They have names like Young Dragon (David Chiang (the only cast member I recognize), Tigress, Red Devil, etc. There are also a few "old-master" types who provide much of the drama and action.Seven Blows of the Dragon was one of the biggest budgeted Hong Kong films of the time, and the story is a true epic scale presentation. Unlike most movies of the time inspired by Bruce Lee films, where the lone hero usually battles against bad guys with a revenge style motive, Seven Blows of the Dragon involves the old masters, the mountain outlaw band, and marauding kung fu armies, and the clash in the end features all three parties going at it, until only the old masters make for a satisfying conclusion.The version of Seven Blows I saw was a pan and scanned cable TV print which had horrible video transfer quality. Perhaps someday the film will get an international release in its widescreen glory. The dubbing is not bad for a movie of this type. The voices are a little cartoonish, but somehow it adds to the larger than life characters portrayed in the film.Seven Blows of the Dragon is a classic of the genre. The martial arts action is non-stop, and the film captures the flavor of ancient China. I don't believe it's currently available on video, but check your old mom'n pop videostore for a copy from the eighties. Or keep your eyes peeled on late night TV. I saw it on TNT a couple years back at 3 in the morning.
tt0069265; First time i saw this film was back when I was 5 years old. We had it in beta format. it was titled Seven blows of the dragon. The fight scenes and weapon usage is flawless. Epic. unforgettable. Last time I ever saw this film was more than 20 years a go. Now, amazingly, it has been released on DVD in it's original title on the Shaw Brothers DVD collection. ( Everybody note, the DVD title of this film is "The Water Margin" ) I also found a sequel of this film called "All men are brothers", but it's no where near as good as this film. Rent it, enjoy it. It will definitely build you up towards one of the most intense final confrontations you've ever seen on a kung-fu movie of this kind. 
tt0069265; Even at the time of its initial US release, THE WATER MARGIN (known to moviegoers then as SEVEN BLOWS OF THE DRAGON) was generally acknowledged one of the better imports because, unlike most "kung fu movies" of the day, it boasted an actual storyline. Although it wasn't always clear, even then, who was who or who was on whose side, the mere fact that there were exchanges of dialogue at all elevated SEVEN BLOWS OF THE DRAGON to unheard of heights among the cognoscenti. Until its recent release on DVD, I had no idea that it was based on a novel (much less a novel boasting a hundred or more chapters). That explains a lot. (Not that it makes it any clearer who's who or who's on whose side...) It was cool to see David Chiang again as "the master of the eighteen tumbles," and I'm still looking forward to the (hopefully eventual) release of Wang Yu's THE Chinese PROFESSIONALS (which I still remember as being a great deal of fun and preferable, back then, to most everything but Bruce Lee's movies). 
tt0069265; It would be interesting to find out how the directorial chores were divided on this very enjoyable production. The style is consistent throughout most of the film except for some poorly shot opening scenes. Those who wince at the classic Chang Cheh red paint brutality will be relieved to know that it's limited to the very end of the film. The rest of the film is filled with good action and brisk plotting.The film is filled with dozens of unique characters, all introduced with title cards even 90 minutes into the film. Readers of the famous book might be interested but most are useless to remember as they barely ever do anything. Fortunately the film has enough merit that you can easily watch without getting confused by the parade of introductions. The two Japanese leads are excellent as is the rest of the ensemble cast while David Chiang carries the majority of the film's personality.There is a strong spaghetti western influence which is not a bad thing in this case. The music soundtrack seems to be entirely ripped off from other films. But the tracks stolen are mostly good, if unusual, choices. The martial arts are frequently very good when Chiang's character is fighting. It's a version of Chinese wrestling that is not shown too often. Chuan Chen must have been the wrestling choreographer since his only other film credit is the sequel to this film. The weapon battles are early versions of the classic choreography of Liu Chia Liang and Tang Chia. Many HK martial art dramas from this era are either too stagy or too brutal for my taste. This film strikes a good balance. Recommended. 
tt0069265;  If you want a great martial arts flick with unbelievable choreography check this masterpiece out well worth your time to watch and savor!!!! David Chiang shines in this movie his grace and style is a wonder to behold.Hunt this movie down now! If you enjoy any kind of action/martial arts movie you will not be disappointed!
tt0069265; "The Water Margin" is based on a great ancient tale from Chinese literature. HOwever, it's not the entire story--just a small portion of the text "Shuihu Zhuan". I am certainly no expert on it--and that's a serious problem, as I had a lot of trouble understanding the context for the film as well as the sheer number of characters. Keeping track of them was impossible for me though I assume many Chinese viewers would be far more material with the characters and source material. I wish I could have sat and watched this with a Chinese scholar--and it's very likely you'll feel the same way. The story is about revenge and abuse of power--but I did have significant trouble following the story. And, although it's a Shaw Brothers film, martial arts are not that prominent in the movie. My advice is that if you know the story well, watch it. I have no idea how to score it for you. But, for the average fan of martial arts flicks who is NOT familiar with the story, I say skip it--it's just too confusing and the action isn't enough to keep your interest.By the way, when this film began, my uncle turned to me and asked a very obvious question--'how are those boats moving so fast?'. This is because the ships' sails are not down and there are no oars--yet the ships are going VERY fast across the water! This is supposed to be the Middle Ages--yet the boats appear to be moving as a result of outboard motors. Could the ancient Chinese have been THAT clever? I think not--though they were darned advanced at the time!By the way, much of the soundtrack for this film was 'borrowed' from the Hollywood film "Hang 'em High". It's pretty weird, as the original film was a western made to look and sound like a spaghetti western--and now it's in a Chinese martial arts film! 
tt0207631;  Let's start with some moaning.  Nostradamus was not the only end-of-the-world movie to come out in 1999/2000. It's also not the best. I'm no medieval historian but AFAIK the real Nostradamus and the one portrayed in the film, do only have their name in common - I felt a bit "ripped-off" by that. It also attributed some "extra works" to Leonardo da Vinci, for good measure.The plot concept is pretty simple really - a bit like Terminator 2. However the action sequences are pretty lame in comparison, as is the feeling of depth. The bad guys aren't really bad enough and the attempt at a romantic sub-plot is so predictable and, frankly, poor.It's not that it's a bad film, there's just not much there - either to engage the brain or "take you to that other world". I enjoyed it about as much as I would have done staring out the window watching the world go by for 90 minutes ...  
tt0207631; A cop - investigating a series of strange deaths, teams up with a psychic, and delves into the world of time travelling monks from medieval France (and finds out a little about his own past, or is that future, along the way)Smacking all the while of being a pilot episode for what could - perhaps - have developed into an interesting series, the film lacks a little polish. However, it's still quite watchable, and certainly killed a dull hour and a half.Never going to be an all time great, but with demons, time travel, and spontaneous combustion, it's not all bad. 
tt0207631;  NOSTRADAMUS is an uneven science fiction thriller starring the hunky but shrill-voiced Rob Estes, former star of TV's SILK STALKINGS and MELROSE PLACE. Estes stars as Mike Nostrand, a homicide detective who battles a strange cult with a bizarre plot to take over the world by summoning the spirit of Nostradamus. With some slight plot holes and, again, the probelm with Estes' voice talents might prove to be quite hard for the discriminating viewer to like NOSTRADUMS, but fans of the genres of hard-boiled cop dramas and time-traveling sci-fi just might enjoy this nice little concoction.  
tt0207631; It is not one of the best movies ever made, but if you like the X-files I bet you will like this too. The movie is not really about Nostradamus too much, even though he is supposed to be the main character, nor about Da Vinci. It is about a cop who gets caught up in this strange cult who try to destroy the world. It is a typical B movie in that. Bad story line, bad acting, lots of fun :) Just remember it is low budget, like a TV movie instead of a big Hollywood production. The special effects are not very good, but it is quite an enjoyable story, and as mentioned before, that FBI cop is hot! :D I bought it for only 3 euro 50 here and I am sure it was good value at that price. I can imagine one might feel a bit ripped off if you got it at full price or rented it expecting a full Hollywood production. This title could have been so much better, if the story line and the special effects would get a huge Hollywood make-over. Still, not bad at all if you are in to B movies 
tt0207631;  Hmmm, started well, like a hybrid of X-Files & First Wave, unfortunately, if the mere notion of Da Vinci's lost time machine is preposterous to you, then the final 'battle' between one man with a pistol and 4 16th century monks armed to the teeth with automatic weapons will seem positively ridiculous equalled only by poor acting, poor script and screenplay, or, in other words, giggle factor 5 captain. 
tt0207631;  This movie was superior to most of its type. Rob Estes and Joely Fisher were excellent  together and definitely made the film watchable. As with most Sci-Fi films some parts required the viewer to be very open-minded but Estes & Fisher overcame this element. 
tt0207631;  Rob Estes, playing homicide detective Michael Nostrand, teams up with an FBI psychic to stop a medieval cult from bringing about Armageddon.The plot sounds a little weak, right???  At least that's what many of you are probably thinking.  But I didn't consider myself a fan of Sci-Fi movies until I saw "Nostradamus".  I wasn't even sure if I wanted to watch, and now I'm glad I did.This movie is dramatic...full of adventure, mystery, and even a bit of humor and romance.  Estes and Fisher really bring this movie to life.I think anyone who is willing to keep an open mind would enjoy this movie. I certainly recommend it.
tt0207631;  Who are we kidding, no one is going to watch this movie seriously. The brilliance is that the director thought people would. With a plot more ridiculous then Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter, a historical base less factual then Kull The Conquerer, and special effects reminiscent of a bar-mitzvah home video, Nostradamus was worth every penny of my $4.95 rental.The movies success, not failure, lay in its glaring plot inconsistencies, atrocious acting, and budget allowing for set pieces apparently made of legos. After all, what other movie would be unself concious enough to loosely base itself on the prophecies of Nostradamus and a non-existence satanic cult. Even the love story was more ludacris then The Omega Code sequel.So, if you found The Last Warrior engaging, entertaining, and above all an occult classic, then Nostradamus is for you! 
tt0207631;  The plot is uneven and it's extremely hard to suspend your disbelief while viewing this film. It is basically a time travel plot and is really laughable. The physics of what is done in this movie are so far fetched, many physical paradoxes which the film makers obviously didn't care to think of. This film's story pretends to be realistic film and that is where it fails. If it had tried to be a fantasy film , and if the script was written by someone halfway knowledgeable in time travel theories and paradoxes, it just may have been much better.As for a modern day cop somehow being thrown back in time to become Nostradamus...yeah right! First of all, i think anyone with common knowledge of history would know that Nostradamus obviously had a childhood and grew up in real times. He didn't just appear in France one day in his thirties and learn to speak French, become a doctor, a scribe, an astrologer, etc...I seriously doubt many people who have seen their majority of time travel (and related) movies would think this was even remotely worthwhile to view.As for the ending...i actually laughed it was so pathetic. It made no sense, the Amish hair style and fake beard they put on Rob Estes was just plain S-T-U-P-I-D!!! I was overjoyed when the movie was finally over, i'm just sorry i wasted 80+ minutes of my time watching it! 
tt0207631;  Forgettable pilot that never really explains why Nostradamus is really important to the plot of this movie, but Rob Estes plays a a hunky cop who happens to be Nostradamus for some reason and who battles time-travelling Medieval monks that run around with guns and set people on fire to start the apocalypse. Oh yeah, there's also a sexy FBI agent who happens to be a pyschic and is trying to get Rob to believe everything before it's too late. Too bad they couldn't predict a better plot. Yawn.
tt0076659; Excellently crafted kung-fu film dealing with the conflict between the Manchus and the Shaolin monks. We see the barbaric actions of the Manchus from early on in the film, and the tension builds quite steadily until there is only one option left: fight to the death.Sammo is brilliant as usual and his directorial talent can be identified in this film clearly. His martial artistry is great and his strength improves as things get more desperate. His use of the spear in the final reel is awesome. Also, watch out for the snake-fist styles towards the end.That said, this is a pretty challenging film in that it portrays senseless and random abuse towards women and children - well pretty much the whole village really. But I guess it makes the revenge angle all that much sweeter... and righteous: (Buddha be praised). 
tt0076659; The Iron-Fisted Monk (1977) is Sammo Hung's brilliant directorial debut. Though the revenge plot is average for kung fu films of the time, the martial arts action and choreography are extraordinary. Iron-Fisted Monk marked the beginning of Hung's movie making prime. In the late 70's and early 80's Hung stared in and directed some of his best films including: Warriors Two, The Magnificent Butcher, The Prodigal Son, Knockabout and The Victim. The Iron-Fisted Monk was the film that got his directorial career rolling.In the Iron-Fisted Monk, Sammo Hung plays "Husker," a young civilian who is taken in and trained by Shaolin monks after his uncle was killed by the Manchus. Seeking vengeance he eventually leaves the temple. After a group of Manchu officials make trouble in a small town, Husker teams up with a local man named Liang and the "iron fisted monk" Brother Tak (Chan Sing) to finally bring justice to the evil Manchu officials.The martial arts action and choreography in this film are unbelievable. The film features some of the "hardest" kung fu you will ever see in a Sammo Hung film. Sammo does a great job playing to his strengths, providing a good mixture of martial arts and acrobatics. When this film was made Sammo was young and very near his physical prime. He is very fast and powerful and gives one of his better physical performances. Chan Sing also gives one of the most inspired physical performances of his career. Along with kung fu, the film features a lot of weapon fighting including: swords, spears, knifes and staffs.The film was made by Golden Harvest studios, which means high production values and a talented stable of actors to work with. Notable appearances in the film include: James Tien as a Shaolin instructor, Casanova Wong as a young monk and Lam Ching-ying as an extra. Fung Hak-on (Warriors Two, Magnificent Butcher) plays the villain yet again and does a very convincing job.Unlike many of Hung's films, Iron-Fisted Monk has a very serious tone. There are some comedic touches but they are overpowered by the intense drama. The Iron-Fisted Monk is one of Hung's more violent films, featuring very aggressive fight sequences and lots of bloodshed. The movie also includes a few brutal rape scenes. The rape scenes are very graphic and intense and, in my opinion, should have been toned down or left out completely. There is also a ridiculous nude scene in a brothel featuring Wu Ma. The scene was meant for comic relief but should have been left out also. The rape and nude scenes are the only detractions to this otherwise brilliant martial arts film.The Iron-Fisted Monk was Sammo Hung's first effort as a filmmaker, but it is hard to tell. The martial arts action in the film is superb and outshines most other films made at the time. There are a few weak spots but overall it is a top notch genre film. The Iron-Fisted Monk is one of Sammo Hung's best works and is definitely in the top 30 best martial arts films of all time. The film is definitely not a family friendly Sammo movie but it is highly recommended for hard core kung fu genre buffs.Martial Arts Genre Rating: 8/10 - "You're a Shaolin monk. How dare you kill indiscriminately!" - "We're here to rid this world of a rapist and a murderer!" 
tt0076659; Iron Fisted Monk, heavyweight HK superstar Sammo Hung's directorial debut, is a powerful old school kung fu movie which sees the portly one at his physical peak on screen as well as calling the shots behind the camera.The story is a familiar one of revenge and retribution, but it is told with style and verve and features some truly incredible martial arts sequences.Husker (Sammo) is a student of the Shaolin monks, learning kung fu so that he can avenge his uncle, who was murdered by the nasty Manchus who control the province. He leaves his training early, desperate to teach the killers a lesson and teams up with a martial artist monk (Chan Sing) who is teaching a group of factory workers how to defend themselves. When the Manchus attack the factory and kill everyone there, Husker and his Buddhist pal decide it's time to even the score.Sammo directs this polished film with surprising skill and delivers a superb movie that blends humour, action and some moments of shocking violence. The scenes of sexual violence (there a couple of nasty rapes perpetrated by the Manchu baddies) may be hard to take at times, but they do give the viewers a real good reason to want to see the Manchus get their comeuppance.The final fight scene is a fantastic display of athletic agility, superb choreography and totally mind-blowing action. Sammo's first movie is a brilliant example of late 70s HK movie-making and should be seen by all fans of the genre. 
tt0076659; It's hard to review these 70s kung fu flicks. It's not like anyone watches them for deeply moving portrayals of the human condition, dialog that slices through social pretense or cinematography that makes you look at the world in a whole new way. These movies are a form of adolescently macho ballet where guys pretend to beat the holy heck out of each other in often ludicrously elaborate ways. You can evaluate them, but you've got to use a standard that doesn't apply to another other form of cinema.To start with, I'm not going to concern myself with how poorly constructed is the plot of The Iron-Fisted Monk. Husker (Sammon Hung Kam-Bo) is a goofy student at a Shao-Lin temple who runs away one day because he's anxious to get revenge on the Manchu clan who killed his uncle. So of course, he really does nothing to seek revenge until he's dragged into it kicking and screaming by Tak (Sing Chen), a villager who has both of his sisters raped and his mother killed by the Manchu. But before either of them go looking for justice, they naturally try and drag Husker's Shao-Lin master (James Tien) to a whore house. In fact, the whole "revenge" thing is almost forgotten until the Manchu slaughter an entire factory full of guys after an attempted business scam involving all the red dye in town goes awry. But, once everyone else is dead, Husker and his master do finally get around to kicking Manchu ass and taking Manchu names.There's also no point is trying to analyze any of the performances here. As with many other 70s kung fu flicks, the acting in The Iron-Fisted Monk is of a very broad and almost vaudevillian nature. Between that and the ridiculously bad dubbing of the dialog into English, it's impossible to tell if you're watching bad acting or good acting from a different cultural context.Occasionally, the direction of one of these things can be a bit more interesting than usual. That's not the case here. If you've seen another 70s kung fu flick, you pretty know what this one looks like. The only thing that ultimately matters with this film and all its brethren isÂ what are the fight scenes like? And the answer isÂ they're pretty good. The Iron-Fisted Monk is pre-wire fu, so nobody flies through air and does a triple lutz before landing on the petal of a daffodil and toe-kicking some guy across the room. But the ritualized back and forth of strike and counterstrike is pulled off nicely, with the "fights" following a certain logic and staged in such a way and you can see what each combatant is doing and trying to do. Distinguishing a lot of a action here is the fact that Sammo Hung Kam-Bo is just plain old fat. He's got a double chin and a physique like a pickle barrel, but he moves with surprising grace and power. Watching him do kung fu is like watching a guy with no fingers play the violin. That he can do it at all is impressive. That's he's really good at it is makes it impossible to take your eyes off him.The Iron-Fisted Monk also has some naked female flesh and a weirdly graphic rape scene. I say weirdly graphic because the tone of the rest of the movie is more slapstick than serious drama, yet the rape of Tak's first sister is pretty explicit and goes on for a while. The effect is almost like someone took a Three Stooges short and spliced in a few minutes from the middle of I Spit On Your Grave. But again, it's hard to know if it's crude and exploitative storytelling or it's some Chinese thing that Caucasians don't understand.If you want a see a 70s kung fu flick, this one is as good as any other. Beyond that, I'm not sure what to say. 
tt0076659; Sammo stars as a man who is learning kung fu so that he can fight the Manchus. The directing from Sammo is good, the camera-work is brilliant, the story is decent, and the fights are very good for 1977. Fung Hak-on plays the main villain, and Yen Shi Kwan and Chien Yuet San play his top 2 henchmen. Always nice to see those 3 in action. Chen Sing has a small role and unfortunately he doesn't get to show off his handwork as much as he usually does. But he's still a great actor so I liked his role. If you have seen most of Sammo's movies and are looking for something else to feed your Sammo craving, then give this a try.Picture and sound quality on the 20th century Fox DVD are good. 
tt0076659; Well. I have to say I am rather amazed that this movie has a 7-star rating at IMDb. I was looking forward to Iron-Fisted Monk, but it strongly disappointed me. The plot and the characters are staggeringly formulaic, and far, far too much time is spent on the bad guys raping and massacring people with impunity (of course, this doesn't mean that there aren't several idiotic comedy scenes in it, also, complete with the worst sound effects in cinema history). There is also far too long between good fight scenes. The last ten minutes are satisfying, but everything else is decidedly below average. A very poor and disappointing effort from Sammo Hung, who has done so many other cool movies. I thought Iron-Fisted Monk would be one of his landmark efforts, but it's more of a landmark failure. It's just not in good taste, and does not deserve a rating above 3 or 4. 
tt0076659; In some ways, it was a memorable film. It wasn't noticeably good or shockingly bad, but it had a few unusual scenes that will certainly surprise and unsettle the viewer. It is not your regular kung fu flick even though it had it all: bad guys, good guys, fights between the two and humour between the fights. For one, it also had descriptive rape scenes. I can't remember a Chinese kung fu film with sex being shown in such a crude way, clothes being ripped off, breasts popping out, lewd smirks on the rapist face and ultimately, the victim's death.That gave the film a startling and awkward contrast with the lighter scenes. A little after the sister of one of the lead characters died following a tragic chain of events, we see that same man, who seemed to be on a quest for revenge, playing around with the idea of going to a brothel with a monk. As this shows, the characters had little consistency -- and little cohesion too, even though Sammo Hung's character was supposed to be the hero, the perspective was shifting so much eventually that it felt difficult to isolate one character as the subject.Bad guys received more and more screen time, secondary characters came forth while the lead wandered off. The only appropriate way to clear up this profusion of central characters was to have them all kill each other. And so is what the script did. Confrontations suddenly pick up speed, people die en masse, "patience", which virtually was the only reason holding back everyone to settle the scores is no more, thrusting the remaining characters into the grand finale, a somewhat intimate fight between the toughest and the nastiest characters, whose unrestrained sadism had been cultivated during the infamous rapes.As if in response to these extreme scenes, the makers chose to end with another extreme, gory violence. Like it or not, it does feel fair, but fair as in a talion. Without these short sadistic bouts that seemed borrowed from American exploitation films of the time, it would have been a pretty unremarkable kung fu story. The fights, well-choreographed and using the classic animal postures dear to a long kung fu tradition, are however terribly choppy, to the point that you could easily time the moves "one-two, one-two" as they are performed. Iron-Fisted Monk is not a good kung fu film to start with, it is an oddity that will be met with greater interest by longtime B-movie amateurs. 
tt0076659;  Breaking barriers and setting new standards in on-screen fight choreography, Sammo's directorial debut is a must for any chop socky aficionado, and although not his best work (a warm up to Warriors Two), it can easily stand proudly amongst them. It's hodgepodge of a story acts as a boiling pot of escalating annihilation, until exploding in a fury of that unique fast and colourful Sammo choreography that we just love so much. Centring on the real-life legend of 'Miller Six' (Sammo), Iron Fisted Monk is driven by a powerful anti-Manchu narrative that feels relentless in its onslaught (they rape, kill, maim and pillage, not to mention bully little kiddies). Miller Six's uncle is killed, he learns the martial arts at the local Shaolin temple, and then off he goes for vengeance. And it's really as simple as that. This is a great movie - well choreographed (by Sammo), well directed (by Sammo) and with some great performances (especially that scoundrel Fung Hark-on who's simply irresistible as a downright evil Manchu warlord).  
tt0076659;  This movie happens to be the first directorial effort by Sammo Hung.  It certainly doesn't do to badly.  It starts off decently, and the learning curve is very sharp.  Each fight in the movie is more surely Choreographed and is faster than the ones that preceded it.  There is a prevelance of armed combat and acrobatics (non-wire) which are all well done.  Sammo is as young as you'll see him in any movie except ENTER THE DRAGON.  There is however an annoyingly large amount of nudity in this movie.  The plot has Sammo training as a civilian in a shaolin temple in order to avenge the death of a neighbor at the hands of some manchu thugs.  He has improved to the point of teaching classes to other non-monks at the temple.  He decides to head out after the manchus, after his skills have reached a certain level.  he is assisted by the brother of another victim of the manchu's, and his instructor, who is the title character.  Sammo and the monk are both extremely fast and athletic, doing some impressive back flips and leaps. give it a try if you run across it. 
tt0076659; Sammo's directorial debut is a mixed bag with some great fight scenes, decent comedy, and unpleasant scenes of violence. The plot, which rolls along almost painfully a times, centers around Husker (Sammo Hung) seeking revenge against the Machus for killing his uncle. Along the way to actually taking revenge he befriends a man who's daughter is raped by the local Manchu official and ultimately enlists in the aid of his wandering monk friend, Brother Tak, to take on the Manchus. The plot changes direction so many times that one has to wonder if it was made up as they went along. There are a couple rape scenes midway through the movie that are unnecessarily explicit and go on much too long. As the movie progresses though we are treated to some decent martial arts sequence, which are not as elaborate as Sammo's later works, but fast paced and solid none the less. Worth watching for the fight sequences, but sitting through the plot might turn you off of the movie before you get to them. 
tt0430065; For those of us who continue to wave the flag for British cinema, perennially undermined by poor scripts or craven overtures to the States, maintaining such respect is very often like trying to love a puppy that keeps crapping on the duvet. So it's a joy when you stumble across a no-budget homegrown sporting great writing, even better performances Â<U+0096> and which doesn't compromise to anyone. Winstone is the mystery john who visits Naomi the prostitute (a terrific debut from Graveson) over 9 consecutive days (the film was shot in 9 days too), without once soliciting sex. He just wants to talk, to find out why she does what she does. On the penultimate day, he even brings a Monopoly set round. If the climax doesn't come as a surprise exactly, the emotional impact remains intact, aided by heartfelt, beautifully understated performances from the cast, including Winstone's real-life daughter. See it. 
tt0430065; I'm just home from seeing this film at Sydney's Film Festival (2005) and have to say I was very impressed. It was especially rewarding to have the director (Richard Hawkins) in attendance for Q&A after the film.The performances were captivating, the suspense was just right (you never lost interest but weren't overly stressed either) and the setting utterly believable. (NB: the locations were real, not sets).The two main characters, although unusual, were validated by excellent dialogue and acting (Winstone and Graveson). And the story was interesting and very moving.I always think the measure of a good film is when I'm not aware of the audience or the chair I'm sitting in. I'm happy to say I was oblivious to both.On the downside, various jerky zooms reminded me that there was actually a camera involved and prevented complete immersion in the story outside of the storytelling. But it is nevertheless astonishingly impressive to see what a small budget ($47,500) and an enthusiastic writer/director can achieve in a 9 day shoot! 
tt0430065; This is not, as some would have you believe, a skin flick just because a hooker is one of the two main characters, It's a great atmospheric work that would make a really interesting stage play as only two sets are required. Made for a budget of ÂL50,000 (which would not cover the Catering Budget of most movies) Ray Winstone did this for free just because he loved the script you cant get much higher praise than that ! I viewed this a couple of days after seeing him in "The Proposition" and for me confirms his status as a Clint Eastwood for our generation who seems to constantly improve the depth of his performances. Jan Gravesen the female lead was equally impressive, as I have not previously seen her in anything, at some points I felt she may actually have been in this line of work at some time .. A solid 8/10 
tt0430065; I really enjoyed this film and the acting was brilliant throughout with some outstanding performances. The storyline is completely original and excels by not allowing the plot to grind to a halt. Ray winstone as always is excellent and proves what a versatile actor he is by playing this role. His daughter's role is executed well and I believe she is destined for better things. Gritty in places and all in all a very good film which deserves to be seen by anyone who likes a drama with some substance behind it. Even though the film is about prostitution this is not portrayed in a gratuitous way so anyone looking for that should go elsewhere. The actress playing the ageing prostitute plays it to amazing effect and her role is kept fresh and you feel like you are sitting in the room with them as the film evolves. 
tt0430065; There are very visual films and there are very talky films.Most films fall into the former category. However, one of the most famous of the latter variety was My Dinner With Andre (1984), a brilliant talk-fest directed by Louis Malle.This little gem has no gastronomic delights and it's no intellectual heavyweight, either. It does, however, hit you between the eyes with its raw emotions and power.Consider this as a plot: an unnamed man (Ray Winstone) spends day after day with a local London prostitute, paying her to allow him to find out everything about her. The hooker, Naomi (Jan Graveson), agrees to the arrangement initially, but soon, she begins to question the man's motivations despite the fact that he's not violent, he's very courteous, but he's very nervous and evasive about what he wants Â<U+0096> other than to ask questions.At a certain point, he tells Naomi his name is Richard. He asks for her real name. She refuses. But he keeps pressing for more details about her work, her life, her loves Â<U+0096> if she has any, that is. He pays her a lot of money to talk. So, she answers his questions. And, at the end of his time each day, he leaves to go home to his suburban house and his suburban wife to watch his suburban TV etc etc.Why is Richard doing this every day? Good question...Were it not for the acting skill of Winstone and Graveson plus the intricate and highly charged script, I think many would walk away from this one, because the narrative doesn't seem to be going anywhere. That is, until you realize that Richard is slowly but surely gaining Naomi's trust: and eventually, Richard is no longer a john or a client. He's a friend...So, it's when Richard finally asks Naomi to do something extra special for him that the real reason for Richard's interest in Naomi is revealed in an emotional climax that will touch all but the most cynical or hard-hearted.So, to say any more about this very clever narrative would spoil it completely.Cinematography and music soundtrack are excellent, although I was a bit annoyed by the overuse of quick zooms in, reminding me of the way some Asian directors do the same technique with martial arts films. That aside, it's actually very well photographed, with some unusual stairway shots. Some might say it is way too slow. Given the context of the whole story, however, I think it's just right.Now - all of that might make you think this film is a downer. Not so. In fact, it's an object lesson in what it means when you gain somebody's trust Â<U+0096> and the final scene between Richard and Naomi says it all... 
tt0430065; For those of us who continue to wave the flag for British cinema, perennially undermined by poor scripts or craven overtures to the States, maintaining such respect is very often like trying to love a puppy that keeps crapping on the duvet. So it's a joy when you stumble across a no-budget homegrown sporting great writing, even better performances Â<U+0096> and which doesn't compromise to anyone.Winstone is the mystery john who visits Naomi the prostitute (a terrific debut from Graveson) over 9 consecutive days (the film was shot in 9 days too), without once soliciting sex.

See it. 
tt0430065; When Richard arrives at Naomi's door, we figure he is a shy man that wants to have sex with her, yet, all he wants to do is talk. This strange behavior, does not not prepare us for what Richard's real intentions are. In fact, he turns into a pest, as far as Naomi is concerned. Of course, she does not mind the easy money she gets from this weird man.Little by little, things about Richard are revealed. The first one is that he is a cop. The other one is that his wife, who appears to be a bitter woman herself, realizes that her husband is not merely working overtime, he is involved in what she thinks is just having sex with a prostitute. It is not hard to put two and two together, there are credit card and checks statements that speak loudly about Richard's activities.We get to know the real purpose of the policeman's visits to Naomi and how he gets her to tell him about her trade secrets. Deep down Richard is a man that is carrying a horrible burden inside his heart. What he has really come for, comes out in the open when he takes Naomi with him to a hotel room where another woman, a prostitute has been summoned. In the end, Richard is grateful for all he has learned from Naomi.This intense British film, written and directed by Richard Hawkins came out of nowhere. We had no idea what it was about, but it paid handsomely in the resulting drama. Mr. Hawkins achieves a claustrophobic atmosphere in the film. After all, it basically takes place in the room Naomi uses for business purposes.Ray Winstone is nothing short of sensational in his take of Richard. He makes a good impression as the tormented individual in search of answers for the tragedy of his life. Jan Graveson does a fantastic job as the tired woman that has seen better years. Since prostitution is the only thing she knows best, she has to survive by selling herself to anyone, even seeing someone like Richard. This is basically a two character film in that the two principals are always on camera. What appears to be like improvisation must have taken the director and the stars a lot of work to achieve, and yet, the interaction comes easily between them.An interesting film that will pay off by staying close to what is really going on. 
tt0430065; An absolutely uncanny performance from Jan Graveson as the Soho prostitute - her character, way of looking, her walk, her movements, facial expressions, tone of voice and the thoughts these implied were uncannily realistic. Her dialogue was so natural - her reaction to her oddly motivated and persistent client, her wariness that he might be violent and her irritation at some of his questions - that many lines could be anticipated before they were spoken. The pacing too was perfect - long pauses when she had to consider something, instant responses when she reacted instinctively. How much was owed to the writer-director is impossible to know from simply viewing the film. As a portrayal it was absolute perfection 10/10. 
tt0430065; This film was great because the story was great and the two principal actors gave excellent performances. The core of the film is not about Richard but about Naomi. Richard provides the back story, or 2nd story, but the primary story is Naomi. The story is summed up in a nutshell on Naomi's face the last night that she is with Richard. The film moves from Naomi's "professional facade" uncaring and detached to one of openness and caring. As Naomi spends time with her young prostitute friend it provides her a path on which to walk toward a new openness. The soundtrack is great and the script is sharp. Using available light and many times a hand-held camera Richard Hawkins fashioned a great piece of cinema. Do yourself a favor and see this film. Then ask yourself why can't their be films like this in the U.S.? Save for Brokeback Mountain, small stories with few characters can be as entertaining and enlightening as big productions. The filmmaker of Everything made a great film. 
tt0430065; Just back from seeing this low-budget UK film, written and directed by Richard Hawkins and starring Jan Graveson as Naomi (a prostitute in a dirty room in London) and Ray Winstone as Richard (a mysterious character who only wants to visit Naomi to talk, play cards and ask questions).Filmed in very dark and cramped conditions, 'Everything' is claustrophobic and seedy from the start, but starts with much more potential than it actually fulfils. I could see the 'twist' coming from a long way away, although I can't fault the central characterisations of performances of Winstone and Graveson. It could have just been a little bit more off the wall than it is. 
tt0065595;  Not to be confused with the 1972 horror film about wax museums called Crucible of Terror, This is Crucible of Horror (1970) - British title: The Corpse. The film stars Michael Gough (Alfred from the Batman films) as Walter Eastwood - a wealthy, cruel & sadistic husband and father. Yvonne Mitchell plays Edith, the poor unfortunate woman who's basically lost her soul being married to Walter. Their children are Jane (Sharon Gurney) and Rupert (played by Gough's real life son, Simon). Walter consistently abuses Jane and praises Rupert. In one frightening scene, Walter beats Jane with a reed for stealing money from a friend of his. Rupert is the only one with a reasonably normal relationship with Walter - and why shouldn't he be? Walter puts his son on a pedestal and abuses his wife and daughter mentally and physically. The point of the film is that Edith and Jane reach their breaking point and decide to end their abuse by putting an end to Walter. So they poison him and make it look like a suicide. Then they have to worry about keeping it from Rupert. Things don't go exactly as planned. I won't dare ruin the outcome of this suspenseful british classic. If your a fan of the best Hammer films and horror of the late 60s and 70s, I highly recommend seeking Crucible of Horror out. There is something about this film, the music, the cinematography, etc., that creates a chilling atmosphere. Turn the lights out when you watch this. You'll never see Alfred the butler in the same way again!  
tt0065595;  Those with long memories might notice this film borrows more than a little from DIABOLIQUE, if not necessarily in a good way. Despite a nasty caning and attempted murder this is more about psychological torment than physical violence, the lasting impression is that typical English family life is enough to drive anyone to murder or bonkers, in that order. One of the seemingly endless string of potboilers that Michael Gough used to liven up, back in the day. 
tt0065595;  Michael Gough is his creepy best as a sadistic man whose wife and daughter plot to kill him.But is he really dead?With more than a nod to DIOBOLIQUE this movie kinda creeps to an ambiguous(to me,anyway)end.I liked it. 
tt0065595;  Really a very good example of British repression.Michael Gough is a bullying sadistic father of "Jane" (played by the young and beautiful Sharon Gurney, daughter of English actress Rachel Gurney).The actors are top drawer and the script by Olaf Pooley is tight and suitably grim. The seemingly genteel facade of a respectable English family is ripped aside. The girl and her mother plot the ultimate revenge on Gough--but do they manage it? You'll have to try and track down this mini-gem to discover what happens. Or does it? Some exploitation of young Gurney with Gough playing some sort of nasty escapade with her whilst she is nude in a river - quite a revealing scene - and then a scene in her bedroom at night when he shows up with a thin cane and bends her over the vanity for a ferocious beating. Nice work also by Yvonne Mitchell as the worldweary mother who sees all and says little. She has a plan, though. If can find this one, buy it. 
tt0065595; I've always enjoyed this film, better known under the export title CRUCIBLE OF HORROR than the more descriptive British release title THE CORPSE. Nearly every Gothic horror fan over the age of 30 will remember seeing it on a local late nite creature feature at some point, where it would play along such related fare as CONQUEROR WORM or IT! with the rampaging Golem, though it's more of a psychological drama rather than a full-blown horror outing. But while it may seem slow there isn't a wasted or unnecessary scene in the whole film, which is essentially an update on DIABOLIQUE with a dysfunctional British family dynamic instead of a boarding school.CRUCIBLE centers on priceless British character actor Michael Gough as the tyrannical, sadistic patriarch of a staid British family. He's the kind of guy who unwinds after a long day by putting on a shirt & a tie to work on the gardening for a bit, then psychologically tortures his long suffering wife and daughter over a thoroughly unappetizing looking dinner. Then maybe a glass of sherry and take the riding crop to the daughter for no good reason. The guy is stuffy, uptight, demented, weird, and heartless, which is all we need to know about him, and Gough does a magnificent job of making us hate his guts.His son Rupert plays along with the old man, seeming to get a kick out of the mental abuse hurled at his sibling & mum, and in my opinion is the most twisted character in the drama. He works at the insurance firm with his father and likewise relaxes around the house in his tweeds, the two men driven spare by things like a random Kleenex on the night table or the family guns in slight disarray. Their off-hours consist of an endless pursuit of wrongdoings by the women of the house, who in due course get sick of it and plot a murder.One interesting aspect of the movie that I don't see others raise is the question of who is more evil: The domineering, abusive, sociopathic men of the house, or the women who grind up a bottle of sleeping pills, blend them in with a bottle of cognac and force it down someone's gullet with the aid of a huge funnel? The movie then picks up a bit of steam when the (apparently) dead body first disappears and then begins turning up in odd, inconvenient places at just the wrong moment, say when the nosy neighbor turns up with his bloodhound wondering where the old man has been. A great deal of time is spent with the two women fretting out the night, wondering what will happen next, raising the interesting question of just who is playing whom here, and is there some supernatural force at play or are they just inept killers?What works with the film is an almost unbearable sense of claustrophobia, comprehensive creepiness and dread, as well as Gough's delightfully nasty performance as the emotionless father. What doesn't work is one of the standard complaints about British horror from the period in which it was made: There are no real fireworks in terms of violence, gore or sexuality. Instead the film's perversity is suggested by a serious of flashbacks & dream sequences that seem to imply a forced incestuous relationship and spousal abuse, all of which is brimming under the surface while never really being elaborated upon. The audience's own polymorphously perverse nature is projected onto the film by such grimace inducing scenes as a father feeling his daughter's bicycle seat to see if it's still warm (ewww!) and a mother regarding her son with quiet resignation after witnessing him slapping around his sister.And while it isn't very shocking the final climactic scene is one of the strangest sequences in the subgenre of British horror, raising more questions than it answers -- was anybody really murdered at all? If not then why did a particular character go through so much bother to creep everybody out? Was there some sort of a plot in works even before the ladies hatched their murder scheme? And was that a calculated part of this greater plan? The film succeeds by not answering any of these questions and closing on a great Hitchcokian downbeat that would have been undone by having somebody explain what may or may not have happened. Hitchcock would have approved.5/10 
tt0065595; THE CORPSE is one of Michael Gough's almost entirely unknown masterpieces. In fact the film is so unknown that one is only likely to come across it by accident on the IMDb like I did.Unlike most horror films, where the villains are monsters, vampires or masked serial killers, this film focuses around a typical British upper middle-class family. The plot line seems straightforward Â<U+0096> a cruel and sadistic man is murdered by his wife and daughter, and the murder is made to look like suicide. But, all is not what it seems as is revealed later in the film. The body mysteriously keeps disappearing and reappearing in different places, and disconnected phone lines suddenly become reconnected. I won't give away the ending not because I believe it would spoil the film, but because I don't understand it.As another reviewer has pointed out, the film creates a chilling atmosphere through the use of suspenseful music, dream sequences, flashbacks and psychological violence. In fact, it is the psychological torment that the father inflicts on both his wife and daughter that makes the film disturbing. Only one major scene of actual violence is shown in the film and that is the one where the father beats his daughter with a riding crop as a punishment for stealing money. And this scene isn't explicit. The scene cuts to and from the bedroom where the daughter is being beaten in a very-paced scene, which makes the scene more disturbing as the audience is left to ponder over what is happening. It is one of the best scenes I have seen in a horror film.The acting is top notch. Michael Gough excels in what is perhaps his best performance as the ultra-conservative, cruel, sadistic patriarch Walter Eastwood. Yvonne Mitchell is also brilliant as his psychologically tormented wife, Edith. Even Sharon Gurney gives a great performance as Eastwood's daughter, Jane. Sadly, the excellent performances provided by these stars did not seem to open doors to other similar projects at the time. Michael Gough spent the rest of the decade making trashy films such as HORROR HOSPITAL. Yvonne Mitchell made only a couple of films before her untimely demise in 1979. And Sharon Gurney's future career was mostly restricted to television before seemingly disappearing completely from acting in 1973.The audience gets a real feel for the characters, particularly Edith and Jane, through the use of dream sequences and flashbacks that delve into their thoughts. The introduction of the sequence showing Walter Eastwood at the exterior of the house in the garden before going inside almost acts as an invitation to the audience to see what is happening in this seemingly ordinary household. The film starts with a few references to suggest that Walter Eastwood is an over-protective father. But as each scene progresses, he starts to reveal his true colours, and the audience can clearly see that he is more than a little over-protective. The impact of his cruelty is unbelievable. The audience can almost feel the tears about to come out of Jane's eyes in a scene where she witnesses Eastwood reading one of her private letters at the family dinner table before proceeding to tear it up smugly without even showing it to her.Those who only know Michael Gough as Alfred the Butler from the Batman films of the 1990s would certainly be in for a surprise if they saw this film.The ending seems to be the one thing that lets the film down. It is perhaps the most confusing I have ever seen.I give the film 8 out of 10 for an excellent effort by both the crew and the actors. 
tt0065595; An abusive man(Michael Gough, never failing to serve us someone to easily despise) is supposedly poisoned by his long-suffering wife and daughter who decide to kill him after having stomached enough of his vitriol and corrosive personality. The question is did they truly poison him enough to finish the job? I must admit that "Crucible of Horror" tested my patience, it is the very epitome of slow-moving. The plot takes quite a while to get to the *murder* of Michael Gough (truly a jerk, but his wife and offspring, including a well-treated, spoiled weakling son, aren't exactly saints), 45 minutes, to be exact. We are treated to the tension and misery prevalent inside this family household. "Crucible of Horror" utilizes the oft-used "perfect murder" scenario where a calculated murder doesn't go according to plan, with complicated results for those responsible. Circumstances such as a friend of Walter's coming over to the cottage while the two were hiding the corpse, worried that he will discover what they are up to, finding the body (they had placed Walter's corpse in his bed) in a different place, and listening to the cottage phone ring despite the fact that the cord was unplugged. There's nothing here you haven't seen on "Columbo" or "Matlock", though, and the stories on those shows moved at a better pace, without the lethargy. I do think the film sets the stage well, we feel, right from the get-go, that this family is on the verge of collapse, Walter creating the contempt that exists between father/husband and the ladies under his roof. We get the "disposing of body" scene that may or may not have a chest containing the corpse of Walter, as well as, the aftermath which follows the guilt-ridden mother and daughter, plagued with paranoia that they might not have gotten rid of the tormentor. The conclusion is a depressing one offering the possibility that the tormented may never have freedom from their oppression. God is Gough good at portraying repellent assholes, in this film he really gets under the skin, just his pompous stare and air of superiority are enough to warrant sympathy for those looked down on. The cast is really solid, with Sharon Gurney (probably best remembered for "Raw Meat") as Jane, the daughter who gets a switch beating for stealing and Yvonne Mitchell as the weary, browbeaten wife who seems to have lost her personality after years of living with such a tyrant as Walter. Simon Gough, I believe, elicits bad will from a viewing audience because of his heralded stature in the family, his father's favor the reason we loathe this young manÂ<U+0097>his Rupert seems oblivious to what his father has done to the other members of the family. There's a prevailing sense of sadness that is palpable, not to mention, the ending provides an even worse feeling of hopelessness. 
tt0065595; **SPOILERS** A bit uneven but still interesting family drama with an overly strict father Walter Eastwood, Michael Gough, who's constant mistreatment of the women of his household his wife and daughter Edith and Jane, Yavnnoe Mitchell and Sharon Gurney, leads them to a plan and later make an attempt on his life. We see earlier in the film how Walter's daughter drives him batty both with her screwing around and her kleptomania. Jane stealing of money from the local Golf Club has the club's manager Gregson, David Butler, show up at the Eastwood residence asking Walter for the money that she took. Gregson also seemed to have something going with the 16 year-old Jane that had nothing to do with putting a golf ball. We later see that Jane also has something going on with local grease monkey Benjy, Nicholas Jones, who also has the hots for her but only from a distance. Later Walter, after Jane swore that she didn't steal the club's money, finds the stolen money in Jane's wig he gives her the beating of her life. Even though we never see Walter abuse his wife Edith physically he does treat her as if she's a bit mad. Which we later find out that she is. Later Edith and Jane concoct a plan to murder Walter when he goes out to his country cottage hunting that weekend. The "plan" doesn't go off well but in the end the two do in the overly drunk, which they made sure that he was, Walter. Leaving his body to be found later in bed dead from an apparent heart-attack. But later as the two murderesses don't get any call from the people that Walter was to meet hunting it's obvious that something went wrong in their hair-brained scheme. The ending is a bit hard to take but overall the movie "The Corpes" is much better then you would have expected it to be because of the top notch acting by all involved in it, even the dog Sam did a good job of "acting". There were a number of really good dream-like sequences in the movie involving Edith that showed just who mentally unstable she was. There's also a flashback where we see Walter, again, brutally beat Jane in a lake with her almost nude. Walter himself seemed to have this "Mister Clean" faddish where he would vigorously wash his hands every time he touched something or someone he felt had germs or dirt on it, or them. Walter's son Rupert, Simon Gough, was the only one in the family that he didn't abuse since he felt that he lived up to the very high standards that he set for his family members. Rupert was a combination insurance salesman and stock broker. 
tt0065595; Growing tired of his controlling behavior, a woman and her daughter conspire to kill her husband and hide the body away but get into trouble when he disappears from his hiding spot and sets out to avenge their behavior.There's not a whole lot about this one that really works. The main thing going for this one is the fact that there's a rather fun set of scenes in the later part of the film that really sells how possible it was that he was never affected by the poisoning attempts. The varying matters of trying to escape the potential return are the film's sole interesting areas with the two constantly trying to get over the idea that he has indeed returned not being dead originally, so their efforts to reassure themselves come against the concept of whether or not what they're seeing and experiencing is true. Running around the house closing doors and windows, barricading themselves in rooms across the house or trying in vain to keep each other sane through the countless interrogations and questioning from their friend that adds a classic sense of paranoia and freak-outs that run wild in old-school Gothic horror which really gets worked out here due to the classic style layout of the house and the actions at that time. The fact that all this good stuff occurs at the end, and is really all that matters for it anyway, means that there's not a whole lot about the rest that works at all, oftentimes being flat-out intolerable. The business with the manager appearing at the house for as long as he does here, the rather innocuous segments with the brother and the interactions with the two at the end while they argue about the different ways to get away with the death is where this goes off-track by filling the first half with such absolutely banal plots that this becomes so hard to get into. This series of scenes is such a hard intro to the film that it feels like a banal drama/thriller at times and only occasionally feels like a horror film during these parts, which is the biggest issue weighing this one down.Rated R: Violence, Language and Brief Nudity. 
tt0065595; AKA Crucible of Horror, this movie is a psychological thriller about a sadistic husband and father who plays cruel mental and physical games with his family. When the mother and daughter (Sharon Gurney) have finally decided that they've had enough, they turn the tables on this brutal bully and give him a taste of his own medicine.For tight, merciless tension and venom, this bloodless movie is uncommonly effective and engrossing. Sharon Gurney is also engrossingly naked, however briefly.It is one of those films that would be enjoyed by those who grew up on VHS cassettes, but younger views who do not have low budget experience will likely find it tedious. 
tt2960270; Very nice indie movie with two great leads - featuring the German Joaquin Phoenix ,) - and a cool plot. Cinema in your face. A Boy-meets-Girl-Story in the surrounding of a luxury resort at the Baltic Sea. She has problems with alcohol, he is very shy and reluctant. They meet in the hotel and help each other to overcome their respective shortcomings. I liked the characters and especially the editing. It gives the movie a special look and makes it fun to watch. Lots of apparently unscripted dialogue, fresh and authentic acting. Great music too, German Indie mixed with international stuff. Looks like we are getting - slowly but surely - a veritable scene of young German filmmakers, actors and producers who are able to deliver high-quality work. Recommended for lovers of the German Independent film, such as Axel Ranisch, Tom Lass, Nico Sommer... 
tt2960270; "Love Steaks" is the last of the five nominees for Best Picture at the 2014 German Film Awards I have seen and probably the weakest one. It is even slightly worse than the very much overpraised "Finsterworld". If "Love Steaks" was actually a good film, you could probably call it a hidden gem. But it is not, despite the awards attention it received. Being indie does not automatically mean being a quality movie.In the center of the film, we have two hotel employees. We get to witness their struggles and their interactions with each other as they slowly fall in love and with their customers and other colleagues. Occasionally, it reminded me of Maren Ade's "Alle Anderen" (not a fan of this movie either), maybe as a prequel to it, with the way the two lead characters interacted with each other, sometimes moody, sometimes powerless, sometimes full of energy, but always full of contradiction. The story is not particularly innovative and while the characters are played and written in a solid manner, there is nothing outstanding about either aspect either.The alcoholism aspect was included in a rather shoddy manner sadly. This could have worked so much better and I am usually a sucker when it comes to addiction (especially alcohol such as James Ponsoldt's "Smashed" starring Mary Elizabeth Winstead) in movies. However, this never had me at the edge of my seat.This film is not a must-see by any means unless you really try to see every German movie there is. One thumbs-up I am giving it that all the hotel employees were played by actual hotel employees and even if their roles were fairly minor, you never realized that they weren't any pros. The two lead actors, just like writer-director Jakob Lass apart from his work on short films, also did okay taking into consideration that they are fairly new to acting in film. There is room for improvement sure, but it is not a horrible start by any means. 
tt2960270; Love Steaks finds the timid and awkward Clemens (Franz Rogowski) starting a new job as a massage therapist and reiki trainee at a luxury hotel in a German-speaking country. While he learns the ropes amid the stringent attitude of the hotel, Lara (Lana Cooper), a blonde host mess who works in the kitchens, takes pulls of the cooking wine with the other cooks and participates in devil-may-care hijinks that earns her several talkings-to from her superior chef. Once the kitchen discovers Clemens and begins to pick on him, Lara begins to crush on him amid her alcoholism, and when he finds her passed out on a beach and massages her gluts, the two initiate a clandestine but reckless romance. Lara's wildfire personality and Clemens' calm yet unsure demeanor culminate in some charming, cutesy scenes ensconced in the depressive atmosphere of the hotel, with polished production that underpins the sterile and authoritarian nature of their work residency. As Clemens pushes Lara to overcome her alcoholism, though, it adds onto the pressure she feels from the hotel authorities and her fellow cooks (who make fun of her and Clemens' cleft palate scars and appearance), fermenting instability. Rogowski exhibits fine acting with a naturally distinctive way of speaking, and drives his character home. Although the film ends in a somewhat unexpected upheaval, Love Steaks relies too heavily on the characterization of the two protagonists in their environment, and the narrative aspect comes to a bit of an unsatisfying standstill, seemingly unfinished. It's not a stinker by any means, but it left me wanting more. 
tt0291943; Polt is telling a fairy tale, a dream he had of how he became emperor of Rome 2000 years ago. The time is cruel, bad luck if you are a slave. Germanikus is enslaved by the Romans. He is not very bright, but stumbles through the scenes and while a lot of the other slaves got killed sooner or later, he survives and makes it to the top. The movie is just entertainment, it has no special meaning (as far as I can tell). And I admit: I did laugh at several points. The use of dialect doesn't bother me, I don't think that Polt can do without. But the dialect is not the source of fun in this film.Most of the comedians playing other minor roles don't have the room to deliver fun or even a personality. They just appear and say some lines. The focus is just on Polt. Many flaws to be a good movie.There are other movies out there which are really tasteless and disgusting. This one isn't that bad. It deserves 4/10. :-) 
tt0291943; What happens when a genius of satire collides with popular comedians of German TV...? Not necessarily something good. The comedy-content is very poor and looks like thrown in just for commercial reasons to fit into the successful tradition of other German comedy-movies of the last years. But it's done very poor. Flat humour is not Polt's and his director's (Hans Christian MA1ller) cup of tea who have made great satires together in the 70ies/80ies for TV and the big screen. And because the comedy in "Germanikus" is loud and in the foreground, Polts more subtle ideas get almost erased totally here. I feel sorry for Polt because for me he always was and still will be the better and far more intelligent alternative to flat German comedy. Strangely, here he has delivered exactly what he does not stand for. This movie should be buried really deep. Gerhard Polt in his earlier films and especially on stage is a whole different world. A delight! But this movie here is torture. It was maybe messed up by too many cooks with too many differing interests. At least, it only can get better now! ,) 
tt0291943; For decades Gerhard Polt, together with the likes of Loriot or Dieter Hildebrandt, has been a pinnacle of intellectual humour. The American reader may compare the style of George Carlin to that of Carrot Top and then compare Polts humour to your average German slapstick performers, who generally steal their material from US-TV anyway. Polts wit was unique, sharply observing and reflecting his middle-class Bavarian background in a way that few others were capable (or even dared).Having mentioned George Carlin (or take if you like Seinfeld or Richard Pryor), imagine them acting like the silliest copy of Peewee Herman, in a movie that not only features Carrot Top BUT also Tom Green and Ernest P. Worrell! You might imagine that the film was directed by the bozos who committed those "Epic Movie"-films but to your disgust, once the credits roll, you discover that the atrocity had been filmed by Blake Edwards. Not a very dignifying thought, I know, but to mention dignity and "Germanikus" in one review is a paradox in itself.We're told the simple yarn of Germanikus (Polt, unfortunately), a rather incompetent member of a German tribe who, through the most unlikely of circumstances, twists and many flat jokes, becomes the emperor of Rome. The road is littered with cameo appearances of many, many currently fashionable slapstick- and stand-up comedians and even less fashionable comedians, hoping for some promotion.To his credit it must be said that Polt looks uncomfortable at all times, perhaps owning his friend and partner Hanns Christian MA1ller a favour. Or perhaps MA1ller witnessed Polt committing murder with a chainsaw and used that to blackmail Polt into the role. No less uncomfortable in her quasi-Asterix costume looks Gisela Schneeberger, having played Polts wife for the past three decades, she might have decided that there was no good reason for breaking a habit. Or perhaps the three of them just needed the money.I can honestly say that I recommend virtually everything Polt-related. "Kehraus", "Herr Ober", "Man spricht Deutsh" or the cult TV-series "Fast Wie im Richtigen Leben", all are highlights of GermanÂ  sorry, my bad, Bavarian comedy. Listen to all the audio-books and watch his stand-up show wherever he may appear. They are as brilliant as they have been for the past 40 years. Just, whatever you do, avoid "Germanikus" like the plague. 
tt0291943;  This movie has nothing to offer whatsoever. The story has no funny moments at all and the dialogs leave you with an utter feeling of emptiness. Gerhard Polt just doesnÂ´t seem to understand that the jokes he made in his older movies were ok at the time but now are simply old and boring. The use of dialect is frequent but not in a way that would surprise you or add to the characters. The supporting cast consists of actually good actors or comedians but there lines are just not funny. IÂ´m sorry to have wasted time on this movie. Btw the worst is still Roadflower (if you donÂ´t know it do nothing about it)  
tt0291943;  This is another horrible excuse for a "movie". If you saw the trailer, don't expect more - the only 3 jokes in the movie were contained in the trailer. Trying to catch the audience with heavy Bavarian dialect, this film about a lucky German who is sold as a slave in Rome is an awful rip-off of "Der Schuh des Manitu", another German comedy which features a lot of dialect. Whereas "Der Schuh des Manitu" is a funny parody of Western films and has some really decent scenes, the script of "Germanikus" is stupid, boring and lacks everything a comedy must have: jokes. Probably little children could enjoy this movie. The actors are mediocre at least, sometimes awful. The producers maybe thought they could make a lot of money with a movie that's a bit like "Der Schuh des Manitu". Germanikus is a waste of time and money. Avoid this mess at all costs. 
tt0070413;  This film is a classic of sci-fi for my generation. We did not get a chance to watch Star Wars or Star Trek. We watched Moskva-Kassiopeya many times for its strong context, great adventure and clever dialogues. It has right mix of comedy and suspense, good characters and very strong plot.This adventure tells a story of a group of young astronauts freeing civilization of one of the planets in constellation Kassiopeya from the empire of artificial intelligence - robots.I may never see this movie again in my life. It's a pity that it is probably considered as an obsolete piece of the soviet propaganda. I never felt this from this movie and who has seen some masterpieces from soviet cinematography knows that all of them  criticize regime in a very effective way.Moskva-Kassiopeya is a great movie for all ages. 
tt0070413; I just read the other comment. I myself watched it on East German TV in the seventies. Now it came out on DVD in Germany, with a German soundtrack provided by the former East German DEFA. I still hope for a new Russian Release with the original soundtrack and subtitles. Great nostalgic sci-fi movie. It certainly is no piece of propaganda of the old regime. You have young people with dreams as the spaceship crew. It is a very quiet movie, the heroes being adolescents sent on the long way to Cassiopeia. But something goes a bit wrong ... no I will not tell you more. At least if you know some German, you can now watch it. As I know the Russians, they will probably have it out again on DVD pretty soon. 
tt0070413; This is, in essence, a Soviet rendition of Star Trek with a teenage crew. The story revolves around a project to send a manned spaceflight to Alpha Cassiopeia to investigate a signal received from there, and, due to the relative slowness of the fastest available engines, the trip is predicted to take something around 27 years in one direction. Therefore, a crew of teenagers is recruited - in hope than when they reach their destination, they will all be aged around 40 and capable of carrying out whatever adult actions necessary to establish First Contact. But, as always, things go awry... The storyline is split up into two parts - this is the first, dealing with the foundation of the plot and the ship's launch.It should be noted that this movie is novel in several interesting ways, including but not limited to featuring its own equivalents of Trekker favourites such as a Holodeck, The Borg, Warp Drives and even our own Soviet version of Q! The sci-fi element follows the same ideas as Star Trek does - an as-real-as-possible (at the time) approach to showing the high-tech stuff, as well as an interesting look at how unexpectedly people making up the crew can act and interact under nominal and stressed-out conditions.If you're even remotely interested in good sci-fi (and good OLD sci-fi specifically), you pretty much owe it to yourself to watch this, probably playing a drinking game along the notion of "Yes, this was in Star Trek only AFTER this movie was made". 
tt1180333; From the start on it is clear that this movie has a beautiful setting and prominent, talented actors. The soundtrack is so close to what you would expect that you hardly pay any attention to it most of the time. Yet as you continue watching you'll begin to wonder if this is your average mystery thriller after all. By the time the credits roll up, you're sure of it.What ultimately causes the movie to fall apart is the plot. The role of the mysterious events in the past is augmented and the tension keeps building up, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats until suddenly the original conflict is seemingly forgotten and the film takes a focus on another series of misfit events. The viewer thereby is provoked to think up ways to link the two of these mysteries together and form a solution, although the characters in the movie are somehow completely oblivious to the idea. A couple of very intriguing characters and relationships are also presented, none of which turn out to connect to the key events either. To put it simple, there are just overwhelmingly more pieces that one needs to complete the puzzle. Most of the time when you are certain you picked up an obviously intentional hint and are waiting for the moment to call out "I knew it!", it just never comes and you are being offered an abundance of hints leading elsewhere instead. This movie certainly surprises you all the time but only because it gives you no chance of guessing the next turn of events.In longer run, the plot doesn't slowly unfold, rather it is a game of passive guessing and not-so-surprising revelations that are rubbed on your face. Towards the end you just stop guessing and semi-reluctantly take whatever the film has to offer. After that they get twisted and canceled out by both past and present events so that in the end the viewer DOES have to do some piecing-up. This dynamic and chaotic nature of the movie is naturally brought up and supposedly justified by the main character's amnesia, but this movie rides on the flashbacks too much to keep the audience with it.In the end, I couldn't even really tell what the theme of the movie was. The tagline supposedly lives up to its name ultimately but the middle portion of the movie deals with melodramatic relationships and surprisingly enough, problems of the Finnish health care system. Every time there was a longer cut between the scenes I could sense the audience holding their breath wondering if the credits would roll up or not, and eventually they did.Still the movie has its merits which aren't to be neglected. The actors were convincing playing their roles even though I've mainly seen Petteri Summanen do comedy pieces before. The settings and props were on par with Hollywood films and overall I couldn't just believe they spoke Finnish in a film of visual beauty of this magnitude.To sum it up, perhaps this movie should have been put together better. All the ingredients of an excellent film are clearly present but they aren't properly in their place. The plot is too complicated with fractured timeline but also seems to have a lot of air in it. I couldn't really recommend this to fans of mystery genre unless you're okay with not being able to solve or even find too much logic in it. 
tt0116081;  I hate French films because they all just stand around and talk about philosophy, but here's a film in which people try to apply existentialism to day to day life and realize that, if no one really exists, it's okay to run people down with your car.  Amazingly funny black comedy is bizarre and brilliant 
tt0116081; This movie is, by far, one of the most intelligent flicks I've seen in my life. Funny, ironic, twisted and never-ever predictable, it has absolutely nothing to do with the gibberish Hollywood piles on nowadays. I cannot understand why this movie hasn't had a bigger success. And please, don't judge this movie by its cover: the one we have here in Montreal isn't the best marketing tool... it depicts a very large hand, coming out of a cloud, flipping the bird to a few people in a field, far below.... Whose bad idea was that?... Anyway. Great movie, great actors, fantastic story line. Go rent it. Better yet: buy it. It's that good. People should learn French just to enjoy this movie. Cheers! 
tt0116081; This movie is absolutely awesome. It is basically a post-modern philosophical treatise, written in the form of a movie, about the real nature of the universe. It explores the question of why we are here, who God really is, what happens when we dies, and what the real nature of the universe is. This movie is skillfully directed and is incredibly witty. It explores some very deep theological and philosophical topics, some of which one has great difficulty in arguing against, yet keeps the viewer entertained. The one thing that keeps on dragging me back to French cinema is their incredible wit and their very deep movies.This movie is about two people who are at the funeral of a very famous author. The author finished writing a book about the nature of the universe and the fact that God is really an author and we are just characters in his book. We have no freedom because God writes the book and controls everything around us. The author finishes the book, gets into a car, and drives into a brick wall at 100 kph, claiming that the wall does not exist. These two, inspired by the authors work, then decide to find out who God really is, get in contact with him, and ask him why their lives are simply a load of rubbish. They say it in a much blunter way, but unfortunately IMDb will not accept that particular word.I guess this movie really asks the question of who God is and does he really care about this universe. The short answer is no. The long answer is that God is an author of a rather pathetic book that nobody particularly wants and all he can really do with the copies that he has made of it is to use them as skeet shooting objects. The main characters decide that they generally are not happy with the way God is running things and decide to force the issue with him. But of coarse God is the author and simply writes in an army of police officers who sort of remind them that they can't really deviate from the grand scheme of things. The police sergeant simply sees them as nihilists, a political philosophy where authority is meaningless and need not be obeyed.The book, The News from the Good Lord, plays a very important role in this movie because it takes the place of the bible. Everybody who is handed a copy of it becomes engrossed in its philosophy. The writer portrayed the universe as not really existing and thus those who read it and are moulded by it begin to treat the universe as insubstantial. Yet even though the book is causing a great impact and turning God's creation against him, God is still in control, as is seen with the police officers.The whole idea of the universe being a book that God is writing is quite possible. I don't believe it, but it follows the idea that we are all figments of God's imagination. Something that is very difficult not to prove with the Bible. As an author it is very possible to mould the world into any way one wants it to. They suggest that God simply doesn't have a good imagination (while I say that he has a superb, and very ordered, one). They also have God pulling them out of the story to talk to them in his own world, but the truth is that God sort of does not really work like that, though he has done that before. Instead, God writes himself into this world. He does it many times in the Old Testament and his ultimate appearance was in the form of Jesus Christ. Just as we can write ourselves into a book, so can God write himself into his.Yet there is always an element of free will. We see it in the movie and we know it in real life. The characters are able to do unpredictable things, such as raiding a police station for somebody to have sex with. Then there is the strike and finally driving into the wall. Suicides never go to heaven, so they say in the movie, and that is because they are not following God's rules. The movie strongly shows that those who do not play God's game are simply removed from the story. This is the same in real life. No matter how we like it, if we refuse to take God as our Lord then he we remove us from his presence. God is giving us an invitation to live with him and we can accept it or reject it. Now everything that is good comes from God so if we reject it then when the party arrives we will no longer have all of the good things that God gives us now.This is completely the opposite in the movie though. God is not a loving creator that wants to spend time with his creation. Instead he is a bitter, unpublished author, who has lost interest in the world and is letting it decay. As long as people play by the rules then he does not care, but as soon as they start causing problems then that is when he intervenes. He does this in the film by bringing the characters to him and telling them that they can no longer be apart of his book because they refuse to play by the rules.This movie is great. It is intelligent, witty, and something that is very much appreciated by me. It is one superb production coming from a country renowned for its bizarre films. This movie did in fact win a couple of awards simply for its wit, not dry wit, but simply an imaginative plot, deep themes, and very thought provoking topics. 
tt0116081; Is this movie available on DVD? I'd love to watch it again but can't find it on neither DVD nor VHS. I would even settle for French with no subtitles :) I think I'll learn French, just to see this movie :) PS 1 Comment about the IMDb comments validation. Could not submit this comment with the French title! The page said "Spelling Error, please correct". Funny ha!?PS 2 I am writing these two PS's so that I can submit the comment! The second error I am getting is saying that my comment isn't too long! Must be minimum 10 line of text!!?! What is this? Can't I be terse, laconic, brief, concise, succinct, straight to the point without having to write this unrelated garbage?

tt0460778; I recommend this movie based on excellent performances, a quirky, moody, suspenseful feel very well supported by unusual and highly effective music, and excellent cinematography.This is a "small" movie in that it is based on clearly defined scenes, separated by time and geography, juxtaposed together to let the story unfold. The screenplay's roots in Bob Meyers's original play are clear.The movie is also understated, leaving some of the work to your imagination. I like this in a movie, but others might find it unsatisfying. This understatement allows a delightful kind of organic humor to creep in from time to time, and allows suspense to build as well. Good job with this quirky directing style! Several of the scenes between the John Goodman character and his business partner had the feel of two veteran actors sitting in front of a camera and improvising: "You are two sleazy hustlers that have worked together for a long time, but one of you is having second thoughts. Act!" They did a nice job with these scenes. Unfortunately, I dunno, to my mind all of those scenes after the important opening of the movie might better have been left on the cutting room floor. (Or, else at least include the other resolving scenes that would have let them actually mean something.) Certainly I would cut everything having to do with the partner's son and son's girlfriend, which added nothing, and had nothing at all to do with the rest of the movie.John Malkovich was excellent. With him the movie is intriguing, and suspenseful. You cannot tell what is going on in his head (is he a brain-fried drunk, or is he in control, perceiving much that he is not letting on? Is he going to take action leading to violence?), but you WANT to try to figure it out. Without his stellar central performance, the movie would risk not hanging together at all. Yay to the Vietnam reminiscence scene with the chickens!All of the performances in the movie were good (save perhaps the son's friend who had a small part and was passable). All of the acting was underplayed and subtle. Everyone was believable.Much of the magic of the movie came from the mix of the unusual, but unusually effective, music, mixed with the brooding, darkly ethereal, cinematography. No schmaltzy rehashed formula strings with repetitive piano plonks here. Much attention was paid to instrumentation (steel drums? overtone-laden bronze prayer bowls?) and the effective use of space in the music to build suspense. The music, the sound, the camera angles, the overall mood in the camera-work did much to focus our attention on the meaning of the performances. Outstanding! The *look* of the movie was also excellent. Even the pan-overview of a brick bungalow in Morton Grove gave us the feel something was going to happen. Be alert! The collage of old rotten boat-bottoms, mud, ancient house-trailer interiors, Southside Chicago expressways at night, rivers, power-lines, bars, and so on really captured the perfect mix between a real close-up view of Chicago, and the magical, beautiful, world of cinema.I might have chosen a different ending, but in the interest of no spoilers, I'll not say more.One theme about the movie stands out: "Non-judgemental." In this particular way it had echos of Van Sant's "Drugstore Cowboy" -- and I mean that association to be high praise.In short, this is a quirky, small, suspenseful movie that leaves plenty of room for the viewer's imagination, with outstanding music, with excellent cinematography and camera-work, and with some outstanding performances. It is probably not for everyone, but well worth it for the someone wanting to see, and hear, something unusual.NOTE: A year later I am adding this footnote. This turns out to be one of those strange and wonderful movies from which the images haunt you a long time. I am very disappointed that it has not been released in theaters. Many movies have come and gone in my mind's eye since I saw this gem, but while they have faded, the images from this movie are still with me. Good job! 
tt0460778; I loved this simple, little film. Not pretentious at all, compared to most movies I've seen lately. First of all, the mice-en-scene was fantastic with a steam punk feeling: boats, rusty trails, trains. This film made even an ordinary suburban area look interesting. The indoor settings were quite ascetic, but everything was well planned yet realistic. An unknown pearl. I didn't imagine anything with John Goodman could be great, but I got positively surprised - even though his role was to play the funny guy.The main character, Mort, played by Malcovich was very realistic, deep and unintentionally funny, and so were the two boys. If you like realistic but somewhat crazy films that tell about a slice in some people's lives, you must see this.They are marketing this film as a "boat movie". But the funny thing is that I don't even like boats. Still I just picked it up at the DVD-store. I'm glad I did. But the film wasn't actually that muck about boats, actually, but about family relationships, about how it is to be near a drunk, to have dreams, to adjust to how things actually are. 
tt0460778; This is not a film for those who want speedy action, but the reverse. This odd movie plays entirely by its own rules, and it is not a masterpiece, but a really good try!John Goodman, John Malkovitch, and Dena Delaney, are the pro stars in this little film about life, and dreams, while the younger kids (Jacob Zachar, and Skipp Sudduth in particular) do a great job here, too.Slowly goes the story forward, in some ways reminding me of Kurosawa's movies about odd people, like his Dodeskaden.A great, fresh, experience this film was, and I can't for my life understand why it has got such a low point as 5.0! 
tt0460778; Sunk without a trace, as this quirky little film obviously did, what with good, respected and serious actors John Malkovich and John Goodman aboard (enough of the puns....)I caught it on Sky Movies premier, partly as I thought it might be a serious drama concerning alcoholism. It isn't but has comedic, jaunty music and amateurish, unconnected fantasy sequences that left me in a constant state of confusion.If one knew the source material (if you actually wanted to) then that might help and whilst Malkovich and Goodman kept it watchable, everything else is a distracting, mawkish blur that makes no sense. The only two user reviews I could find (on IMDb) were obviously fans and so loved it but I wanted an unbiased opinion. It wasn't a total waste of time, with some very good acting, especially from the alcoholic Malkovic, but I couldn't help feel that my time would have been better spent doing something else, or at least, purposeful, like the washing up!I guess that the actual narrative (what there is of one) isn't going to be what attracts you, here, so I'm not going to hurt my brain any further by racking it and trying to write it down. Apologies if that disappoints anyone. It was director Bob Meyer's first and only attempt as writer/director of a movie and it badly shows. 
tt0460778; If you want to rent or buy the German release of this, be aware that the movie is only rated "6+" and not "16+" as the cover suggests. Now why does it say so? Because the disc has trailers on it that are rated "16+", which makes the Disc itself rated that way too. Now that that is out of the way let's get to the movie.It's as you might and should expect a very slow drama. The first ten minutes (and the rest that follows of course) will prove that to you. But it's not like this will be a waste of time. Especially if you like your movies slow like that. There are values to be found here and there is redemption that may or may not come. It's about human downfall and deception. And it has two great actors playing lead roles. It does suffer a bit from its own pace towards the end, where it could have picked up the pace a little, but other than that, this is solid 
tt0460778; A great quirky movie, just what you'd expect J.M and J.G to be involved with at this late part of their career. I does sadden me to see how many reviewers have no idea what was attempted yet had no trouble in dashing the movie to the ground.. I watch all types of flicks, from action to whatever the opposite is and there are indeed very forgettable films out there but this is not one of them. No, there's no chase or gun play, no yelling of expletives while holding someone's collar, i suppose that is that is your water, then you will be a gasping fish.The movie is Jim Jarmusch-esque without the art film pretensions. It does deal with alcoholism and impulse-control and bitterness and subterfuge and other essential life stuff. It has great performances from it's stars and the rest. It did capture my attention from start to finish. It does convey the feel of the Northeast in the summer, the mugginess, the grey heat, the flaring tempers, thereby grounding the picture in a present and concrete reality. And there are so many con-men waiting to steal your dough with a good sleight of hand, that this movie has much relevance. 
tt0460778; Probably the most insignificant film I've seen in living memory. It's a patch of grass, a black sky at night, Tony Blair's obnoxious smile. It's just 'there'.Here's the plot in a nutshell: A woman's drunken uncle (played by John Malkovich) turns up one day. Her son and his friend plan to get him to co-sign on a boat they plan to buy from a corrupt dealer, since their mother won't allow it. That's that. Oh, of course we have many 'meaningful' chats along the way about the alcoholic uncle's childhood, a bit of comic relief as John Goodman hams it up as the nasty boat seller, and a lovely ending where, despite all the weirdness surrounding them, everyone gets together for a GROUP HUG.It just... doesn't amount to anything. In fact, as I sit here typing this now, I am struggling to recall a single moment. It is literally, vapour. I don't hate it, since it held my attention. I just feel like there are better ways to spend your time. Maybe, on something a bit more energetic. Like an episode of Heartbeat. 5/10 
tt0460778; Abe (Jacob Zachar) wants to sail on a boat to a fantasy island and beyond. His mother Eileen (Dana Delany) is wary of her brother drunk Mort (John Malkovich). Mr. Fletcher (John Goodman) has a trashed boat that he hopes to unload on some unsuspecting fool. Fletcher scrams naive Abe to buy the boat but they need an adult to do the deal. That's where his unsuspecting alcoholic uncle Mort comes in.This is completely lifeless. Bob Meyer is the writer and director. He doesn't seem to have done anything other than act in a few french movies. The big mystery is how such an unknown got so many great actors to be in his film. That mystery is infinitely more interesting than watching this movie. This has no energy and no power. The dialog is lifeless and so are the performances. Jacob Zachar is very annoyingly over confident. If he was some cute young kid, his character might actually work. John Goodman almost gives something but it's drowned out by this meandering badly directed indie. 
tt0460778; I waited and waited to see where this film was going , it was just weird weird weird and slow and not seeming to be going anywhere but for some reason I just had to keep watching. John Malkovich is interesting to watch .. I just wanted something big to happen .At some points I was just confused as to what was going on ..such as ' what is that character about?, why is he behaving like that or why is he saying that?' Also there was a ' who is that character and how is he related to the rest of the story?'moment.. not sure if I ever figured that one out ! Although it felt like I was waiting for something to happen throughout most of the film there were a few scenes I guess that you could call life affirming type and arty for want of a better choice of words. So I waited and waited and waited until finally I got the big Laugh out Loud moment I actually had not been anticipating, it was a welcome surprise! Now,to me and my warped sense of humour it was one of the funniest scenes I had witnessed in a long time. The whole film would be worth watching again just for that scene alone even though it was practically one of if not the last scene in the entire movie to me this film was very original,it didn't try hard at all and that's what I liked. It's originality alone wins it extra points !! 
tt0460778; This has got to be one of the most boring and irrelevant movie I ever sat through. At least it felt irrelevant. It's like they literally tried to put the audiences to sleep. It has John Malkovich and John Goodman so it's probably at least a decent movie right? Wrong. That doesn't mean crap. It has really boring conversations that tries to be touching but just want to shut off. If this is a coming of age movie than it did a very poor job of it. The movie has this really old porno cinematography going for it as well. Maybe it's to add to the effect of the movie but it made the flick tiresome. There are better movie for sure, this movie is a waste of time.1/10 
tt3591984; Comments to the plot summary: the absence of our usual comfort doesn't necessarily mean "Neolithic Era" :) What this film has to offer is not what you see on the screen. It's what it makes you think about. It's the memories that it brings. It's much more. You might feel pity for these people in their remoteness, but, in fact, we should feel pity for ourselves in our addiction to comfort and lack of pure human interrelationship. They've definitely got it. It's about us, good and bad, silly and wise.. it's about kindness that is still there, deep inside us. It's about the beauty and magnificence of nature, which is our primary government. Purity, genuineness and reflection... Thank you, Mr. Konchalovskiy! 
tt0037175; This is a patriotic flag-waver of a film that could never be made anymore. The emphasis is on pulling together and supporting the armed forces, all in gleaming colour. It is a wartime film that says although the world is in a spin if we work together to beat the foe, things will work out fine in the end. It is sweet as a sugar coated pill, made to cheer the people up in World War 2. And who better to do that than blonde Betty Grable, lively and bright and charming. There are flashes in the film of the classic pin-up picture of her looking saucily over her shoulder.A formula film then but it does have some bright spots. Joe E Brown and Martha Raye being loud and cantankerous. The dancing Condos Brothers who tap dance like furies. The gorgeous technicolour. Charlie Spivack's band. The musical numbers are OK though the roller skating number and the marching sequence hilarious in the wrong sort of way. There is a real gem in the film, a number called 'Once Too Often', which is a sour song of love and betrayal, at odds with the rest of the saccharine mood of the film. Grable sings it well then dances it with the great Hermes Pan. In her split skirt showing those million dollar legs, she and Pan do a sexy routine together. It's the best thing in the whole movie. 
tt0037175; Not bad, not good for a Betty Grable flick. Story, like all the Fox musicals on the 40's is silly, but sometimes silly can be charming. PIN-UP GIRL focuses on Betty of course and those "million" dollar legs. The story of a want-to-be showgirl who is doing steno work could have somehow worked better with more fluid writing. A couple of good dance numbers, but nothing spectacular. Nice to see old timers Martha Raye and Joe E. Brown, but Martha plays a real witch in this one and takes the shine off her comedic talent. Too bad. Story itself does not focus and what happened to her girl friend, Dorthea Kent, who is in the first part of the movie, then is dropped like a hot potato. Her presence was missed as she was a good side kick to Betty. If you're a Betty Grable fan, and you must be to be reading about this movie, there are others a lot better. Too bad they're not available on DVD. By the way, the DVD transfer is quite nice. 
tt0037175;  This musical/comedy fluff was harmless fun for a nation at war. We get the troop's number one pinup gal, big band music, song and dance numbers, a cotton candy plot, and it's all in Technicolor! Anybody interested in the WWII era will enjoy watching this film, just imagine yourself as one of the boys in uniform or as Rosie the Riveter. The final musical routine with Betty marching with & drilling 2 companies of military women is well executed and must have been just what America wanted to see at the time. Remember: Buy U.S. War Bonds. Available at this theater. 
tt0037175; I've just seen Pin Up Girl for the first time and found it good in parts, but not brilliant.Betty Grable plays a secretary and is a singer as well. She says she's engaged to every service man she has signed her photo for. She does fall in love with a man who's in the Navy and after several misunderstandings, she becomes engaged to him.Despite being made during the Second World War, Pin Up Girl was shot in colour and it certainly is very colourful. There are some good songs and performances, although can be a little heavy going at times.One viewing is probably enough for this movie. Not too bad though.Rating: 2 and a half stars out of 5. 
tt0037175; Splashy Technicolor musical with Betty Grable and Martha Raye has beautiful photography, Grable's incredible legs--although they're not featured as much as you'd think they'd be, considering they were what she was most famous for--and not a whole lot more. The musical numbers are for the most part uninspired, and the casting of unknown John Harvey as Grable's romantic interest was a big mistake. He's a bland, not particularly good actor who tries too hard to be the peppy "boy next door" type and has no chemistry at all with Grable. Dorothea Kent as Grable's sidekick is enjoyable but for some reason she vanishes about halfway through the film. Martha Raye, as always, gives it her best but the songs they stuck her with are, to be charitable, pedestrian and, in the case of "Yankee Doodle Hayride", downright stupid. Grable's "Don't Carry Tales Out of School" is boring--I have no idea why it's performed two different times in the film, as it doesn't get better with repetition. Raye's "Red Robins, Bobwhites and Bluebirds" is a juvenile time-waster and she looks almost embarrassed performing it--the lyrics are childish and the song makes virtually no sense. Just about the only number that has any spark at all is "Once Too Often", which Grable dances with the great Hermes Pan. It's not one of his or Grable's best, but compared to the rest of the numbers in this picture, it's a masterpiece. Joe E. Brown is an acquired taste, which I haven't acquired, but if you like him I guess this is as good a place to see him as any. The tap-dancing Condos Brothers are good, there's a campy but somewhat entertaining roller-skating number early in the film and a very bizarre and really out-of-place sequence at the end where Betty is a drill sergeant putting a female drill team through a series of complicated marching routines--it's almost surreal to watch her carrying a sword and shouting "Dress that line, there!" and "Hup, hip, hoop, harch!"--but even that dose of wartime weirdness doesn't do much for the picture. Overall it's a lower-rank, by-the-numbers effort from people who've done far better. Worth a look maybe just so you can say you've seen it, but other than that, there's not much reason to spend any time on it. 
tt0037175;  Note that the legendary Hermes Pan is the guy dancing with Grable in the wild "Once to Often" number.  He was the guy who worked with Fred Astaire to choreograph and practice most of his dance numbers in the 30's Fred-and-Ginger films. 
tt0037175; Perhaps back then this was seen as a bright and bubbly tribute to the Armed Forces everywhere, but surely BETTY GRABLE deserved better material for a musical with a title like PIN UP GIRL. She's pretty and pert as a secretary whose romance with a soldier goes from Boy Meets Girl, Boy Loses Girl, Boy Wins Girl in timeworn Hollywood fashion.No help is the fact that MARTHA RAYE and JOE E. BROWN can usually be counted on to add gags and merriment to any film they're in. Here, they open their big mouths and nothing funny comes out.The songs are weak, lacking interest even for Grable fans--with one exception. A nifty little number called "Once Too Often" has Betty doing a slit-skirt, torrid dance number with Hermes Pan, the famous choreographer who worked with Astaire and Rogers on many of their most famous routines. It's the only musical number worth staying awake for.The climactic military number is a hoot, with Betty doing a parade of arms military drill that reminded me of my boot camp days.Summing up: This is one you can afford to miss. 
tt0037175; Astaire & Rogers it's not. While it was somewhat entertaining fluff, it had few other redeeming qualities. The costumes were ridiculous, distracting and very unflattering. And unfortunately, there really wasn't anything significantly original in the storyline itself. The final number, while impressive in its precision, lacked variety and musical interest, and consequently became boring very quickly, as the same moves were repeated over and over again. One very notable exception was the performance by Frank & Harry Condos (as The Condos Brothers). Their dancing was exceptional and dazzling to watch. If you're looking for simple fluff and diversion - enjoy. Just don't set your expectations too high. 
tt0037175; Joe E Brown and Martha Raye were 2 veteran vaudeville performers, as well as film personalities, both known, among other things, for their unusually wide mouths. Both were primarily comedians, but neither is allowed to be funny in this '44 Fox Technicolor. Martha was also a singer and does get to do a couple of solos. She and Betty were last seen together in a film when they were both contracted with Paramount, playing sisters in the '38 B&W "Give Me a Sailor", costarring Bob Hope. In that delightful little domestic comedy, Martha was the star and Betty the supporting actress. Here, the tables are turned, with Betty the star performer and providing most of the comedy, along with occasional inputs from rotund Eugene 'bullfrog' Palette, who plays her office boss.Unusual for a Grable film, she lacks one of her usual leading or supporting men. Instead, her romantic interest is a rather faceless serviceman in the form of John Harvey. Actually, this was a rather common ploy in musical comedies during the later part of WWII. Other notable Fox examples include "Something For the Boys" and "The Gang's All Here". Perhaps the most extreme example is Warner's "Hollywood Canteen". The idea was to present a 'nobody' serviceman that servicemen could better identify with, as the leading lady's romantic interest.It sometimes happened in '40s musicals that specialty acts provided the most interesting musical, comedy or gymnastic act, and this is perhaps one of those films.The gaudy roller skating dance act by 'The Skating Vanities', accompanied by Martha's "Red Robins, Bobwhites, and Bluebirds" is certainly the eye candy highlight of this film, and a part of its flag waving aspect. The Condo Brothers also did a couple of nice tap dance numbers, and Betty's dance with Hermes Pan to "Once Too Often" is OK. Later, there is a Viennese waltz scene, with dancers in very fancy classical European dress, preceding and following Betty's rendition of a more contemporary "The Story of the Very Merry Widow".Betty also gets to do a couple other musical numbers, mostly two renditions of "Don't Carry Tales Out of School".Perhaps the most unexpected aspect of this film is the finale overly long marching drill exercise, with rifles, executed by a sizable unit of WACs, with Betty as their competent drill sergeant. Would have been nice to have had some musical accompaniment, as in Warner's "This is the Army". I guess the message was: If we run short of fighting men to help win this war, we have plenty of fighting women to back them up!If you want to see the best Grable/Raye musical comedy, I recommend "Give Me a Sailor", as previously detailed. Betty looks even more beautiful at age 21 in that one. The emphasis is much more on comedy than music, with Bob Hope complementing Martha's comedy. 
tt0037175; Betty Grable and Fox capitalizing (but not crassly) on the musical star's real-life pin-up status with WWII-era soldiers by casting her as a Washington, D.C. secretary who moonlights on the weekends as an entertainer with the U.S.O. Via some innocent and girlish, wide-eyed deception, she wins the heart of a Naval war hero who is led to believe she's a Broadway headliner. Grable doesn't sport the one-piece swimsuit she wears in that legendary pin-up, nor she does exploit her famous legs. Rather, she's displayed here as a nice, decent, small town lass who has somehow allowed several dozen soldiers to propose marriage to her (she doesn't take the offers seriously, so why should the men?). In between fabrications and costume changes, Grable sings, dances, and (most improbably) gets to play drill sergeant to a large company of WAC's in precision march. This last number is quite a mad capper for the picture, which maniacally represents a bygone era of nightclubs, canteens, novelty songs, and rollerskating dancers sporting red, white, or blue ostrich-feather fans. Martha Raye sings too (and gets to have a surprisingly catty side) before she and Grable's pal Dorothea Kent are both unceremoniously forgotten about midway through the film. ** from **** 
tt0101879;  A blend of action/adventure with romantic drama is attempted in this work completed soon after the "Desert Storm" imbroglio in the Middle East, showcasing Rob Lowe and Gale Hansen as U. S. Navy Seals sharing a desire for underwater military operations as well as for a comely marine biologist played by Tracy Griffith.  As the film opens, Lawrence Hammer (Lowe) and Dean Meszoly (Hansen) become best friends while training in California to be Seals, where they meet and compete for favours from Barbara (Griffith), after the course is successfully completed, a Las Vegas sojourn for R & R is discontinued by sudden nuptials for Hammer and Barbara, an event that Dean regards with despair, and so the companionship of the young commandos is no more.  The impending U.S./Iraq conflict, as orchestrated via "Desert Shield", forms the background for the picture's largest segment, as the two Naval officers, now become mini-sub specialists upon opposite American coasts, are reunited as members of a task force to be deployed near an island in the Strait of Hormuz where an Iraqi naval site is reportedly being developed in order to utilize biological warfare.  During what is nearly a suicide mission, Hammer receives severe wounds, and Meszoly requests that Barbara come to Dubai to visit her husband in hospital, hopefully expediting recuperation, but Hammer soon joins his fellow Seals in a last chance foray to destroy the biochemical weapons, no matter what risks the team must take.  The disparate components - personal relationships and combat daring - do not mesh here, primarily from a lack of directoral clarity, in addition to blocking gaffes, as improbabilities quickly become cliche, although there are some suspenseful moments.  The production was shot at and about San Diego and its environs, with acting honours going to Hansen who creates a layered role, actual doctored film segments made during Desert Storm seem positively instructional in comparison with this feature, that additionally casts mainly Israeli players in Arab parts. 
tt0101879; Gale Hansen features in this a lot in spite of being second billed on the credits. He is good with the role that is, unfortunately, limited in any interesting dialogue. In fact the whole film lacks creative flair, which is a pity because it is quite a good story line with some good actors. The overall production is clichA©d and, at times, boring. Yet the two story lines, triangular love affair and strategic target of an Iraqi base with chemical weapons, had a lot of potential. The military one is handled better than the love affair which required a greater deftness of touch than the director or screen play allowed.There are lots of close-up shots of Gale (and Rob Lowe) and he plays the more rounded and sympathetic character though the camaraderie between his character - Mazzoli - and Rob's - Hammer - is good.My rating (6/10) is for Gale and the overall acting rather than the film itself. 
tt0101879; Unbelievably lame flick. I saw it on cable TV. I couldn't believe 1992 was still basically the 80's. This movie was filled with unattractive women with ugly, kinky 80's hair. One scene in a nightclub was laughable. It seemed to be "dog" night. Rob Lowe's sidekick was a guy who looked a lot like a lesbian, especially when he smiled. Not that there's anything wrong with lesbians, it just seemed out of place. I couldn't believe he was a male navy seal. Rob Lowe seemed lost in his moustache...not a good look for him. The 80's music soundtrack was unrelenting - you know..kind of sounds like merry-go-round music. All in all, it was a laughable, yet pathetic attempt of a movie. 
tt0101879; I think the last Aussie reviewer hit the nail on the head. This movie despite being based on the experiences of an elite US naval frog team at war is surprisingly value-neutral when it comes to extolling the virtues of the US military, or even the reasons for going to war. This may have to do with the fact that the writer/director, Shimon Dotan, is an Israeli. In short, I enjoyed this movie, because it introduces some character development in a genre where it is often conspicuously absent. The casting of Rob Lowe as the career jackass was a stroke of genius! That said, there are aspects of honour and sacrifice inherent in his role, which he does bring out. However, like others I felt Gale Hansen stole the show with his role as the strong-willed and dependable leader contrasting with Lowe's as the antithesis. I like the fact that everything didn't work out at the end, and the monologue delivered at the end summed up the whole experience nicely. Go see it. 
tt0101879; this was on the local UPN station here in the Delaware/Philadelphia area. It's not as good as Teague's Navy Seals or the newer tears of the sun. But it does give a pretty good look into actual Seal training, the part were the Chief has the two main characters stand facing each other and slap the other guy across the face when he calls out their name was funny. The love triangle wasn't done well at all but the action was pretty good when you consider it's a Rob Lowe film. Lowe's navy seal mustache is only top by Viggo Mortensens Navy SEAl mustache in GI Jane(both are better then Bill Paxtons in SEALS. The weaponry was pretty accurate for the era with the Seals mostly using MP5 and M4 carbines and what i believer were either Colt 1911 . 45 or 9 mm's for there side arms. It was also interesting to see a movie about seals that actually talked about the dangers of the "bends" and the risks these guys take just by going into the water. One of Lowes best moments was when he was driving the doctor nuts while he was being treated in the decompression chamber. 
tt0101879;  Rob Lowe and Gale Hansen star in this action movie that touches on romance. Rob Lowe plays a fairly sleezy character while Gale Hansen manages to 'wow' us once again with his superb acting talent. Gale, from Dead Poets Society fame, finds himself in a rather unusual role playing a Navy SEAL.Both men do a good job with their given roles, but it has to be said that Mr Hansen pulls off his character with both charisma and sensitivity as he falls in love with his best friends wife. Top marks to his acting ability for this - i was totally mesmerised by his actions. Just sad to say though, that he isn't in many movies - i could watch the man for days without a break :ODEvelyn  
tt0101879; This movie was previewed before Captain America. I don't think I need to say anymore. They're both as good as each other.And by that I mean they're totally awesome! Never before has the emotion of the Gulf War been captured on film with such accuracy! Rob Lowe is a god of the silver screen! The way he owns the screen, its perfect! This movie challenges conventional war films by being sub-conventional! Standards are reduced to bouts of hilarity! Okay, I'm lying, this movie can't be good.Honestly.It just can't. 
tt0095256; The star of "The Exorcist" Linda Blair brings along her best friend to visit her movie makeup effects expert father and mother at their house deep in the woods.Along the way they have a chance encounter with a gang of murderous punks.The anarchists break into the house and murder everybody there.While searching for the money the punks stumble onto a hidden room containing a deformed man called Patrick,who enjoys spilling blood of the villains."Grotesque" is grotesque indeed.There is enough gore and perversity to keep you occupied in its' short eighty minute running time.'Maniac Cop' Robert Z'Dar has a small cameo as one of the punks.Overall,if you are a fan of late 80's horror you can't go wrong with "Grotesque".7 out of 10. 
tt0095256;  Well, reading the other comments it seems there's at least two versions of this out there.  Mine is Media Home Entertainment's, and does NOT have the ending described in the other comments - this version is  monumentally lame, but the version described in the other comments, with Frankensein and the Wolfman, sounds legendary. Otherwise, for those of you under twenty, I want to assure you that, although a lot of weird things happened in the eighties, there were not, as far as I remember, gangs of snarling twentysomethings with Billy Idol hair and dressed in expensive leathers roaming the countryside in VW busses looking for innocent citizens to terrorize.  Grotesque would like you to believe this, it would also like you to believe that Linda Blair can run around in the snow for a couple of hours in her jammies and bare feet and not turn into a snow-cone, or that even Tab Hunter is stupid enough to threaten two punkers with a shotgun, demand they get in his car, and then drive off with them in the back seat, where, one presumes, they will sit quietly with their hands in their lap until we get to Grandma's. Overall, Grotesque is definitely worth hunting down, if you can wrap it up for less than three bucks.  No plot?  No, this thing has more plot than Gravity's Rainbow. *************THIS WOULD BE A LOT OF SPOILERS, EXCEPT THERE'S MORE THAN ENOUGH PLOT LEFT TO GO AROUND **************  Linda Blair and a friend drive up into the mountains to see her folks, and are menaced by a "gang" of punkers also on their way to see her folks, on the rumor that they've got a lot of money stashed, because Linda Blair's dad is a famous FX artist.  Her dad keeps jumping out at her and her friend with rubber masks and body parts, but he's Guy Stockwell, and charming, so it's OK.  The punkers descend on the house, kill everybody except Linda B., but unfortunately let Linda's cousin out of his secret  room, who's a large, horribly deformed, essentially sweet but now angry and murderous kind of a guy, who then kills off all the punkers except two, but then a family friend drives up the hill, finds the carnage, calls the cops, her uncle (Tab) drives up the hill for some reason, and after all is said and done the deformed cousin is dead, Linda's in a coma, the two punkers are shaken but not stirred, and the police begin their investigation. FOLKS, WE ARE NOW ONLY FORTY MINUTES INTO AN EIGHTY-MINUTE MOVIE!!! Maybe Grotesque was being put out on spec, to get backers interested in a mini-series. Oh.  Robert Z'Dar, my favorite actor with a really big face, is NOT in this version.  Also, there's no nudity and the FX are pathetic, But it's STILL worth watching, in horrified fascination, as the plot lurches around drunkenly, banging off doorframes, stumbling over the furniture, just to see whether it finally falls out of a second-story window (it does).  
tt0095256;  Matt and I have seen alot of really crappy movies together. We always have a good time. Or at least we DID until our (ex)friend Ron loaned us this one. We've used the database to check out the background on lots of these movies. This one made us register so we could warn others!There were endless, pointless scenes of crazed people running through murky woods. This is not as bad as it may seem - at least this was a break from some of the worst dialogue ever scribbled on scraps of paper in the bathroom. To be fair, there were two good, albeit brief, moments in this flick. One - A terrorized victim glares at the villains and accuses them of being scum, to which the ringleader replies leeringly "It's a scummy world!" Two - The deformed, heartbroken nephew of two of the victims picks up one of the female attackers and snaps her spine against a pine tree. These moments are not worth wasting the longest 80 minutes of your life. Just say "NO!". 
tt0095256; Starts with a movie-in-a-movie that's pretty bad: an old woman narrating over shots of a house in a lightning storm. Cuts between her and herself as a young woman, and some possibly rotting creature enters. This is just a way of introducing us to Orville Krueger, a special effects guy specializing in horror movies.Krueger goes to his cabin/home in the woods. He's joined by his wife, and his daughter brings a friend. He enjoys scaring them. Some "punkers" in a VW van show up, because one of them used to vacation in the area, and heard there was a big secret involving the "Hollywood" guy, and they assume it's money or drugs - to which they'd like to help themselves.The punkers invade the house, but they find out the secret has more to do with the possible inspiration for Kreuger's grotesque makeup jobs. In the aftermath, Krueger's cosmetic surgeon brother shows up to bring matters to a close (it gets pretty silly).The punkers all overact. The leader yells all his lines, and at least one of the members laughs in a high voice after everything he says. As punks, they're more reminiscent of Bobcat Goldthwait in the Police Academy movies. A better punk gang would have made the movie potentially scarier.The snowy location wasn't bad. Linda Blair is OK, but she doesn't bring anything unique.The movie ends with a freeze frame that shrinks to a small size, and as others have mentioned, some spirited ragtime music that comes out of nowhere as the credits roll. 
tt0095256;  It begins as a horrible "horror" flick, but fortunately we quickly find out that the opening scenes belong to a movie-within-a-movie. Then, for the next 15 minutes or so, there are some decent filmmaking vs. reality games that add an extra layer to the film. But when the punks appear, their embarrassing overacting turns this into a bottom-of-the-barrel affair. But wait! After the deformed man avenges the murders of his "family" and gets himself shot in the process, it gets even worse! There are many pointless scenes that go on far too long, especially the two "good cop-bad cop" interrogation sketches. The ending offers a gruesome twist (though ruined by bad makeup effects)....and then the REAL ending comes. It's one of the stupidest and most nonsensical endings I've ever seen, but you have to admit at least that it takes a lot of audacity to dare end your film this way.    (*1/2) 
tt0095256; I like the film. I thought it was pretty entertaining. Pretty much any film with fake punks as antagonists is fairly fun. Think Class of 1984 with more make up. There isn't very much gore but the revenge element in the film is the clincher. There is a secret chamber in the house holding a terrible family secret. That element of the film was an obvious swipe from Bad Ronald. This is a better B grade film from the late 80's. I always thought this was a project where Linda Blair must've been desperate for work. Later I learned she was executive producer or something of that sort. I hope this makes it to DVD in the correct aspect ratio one day soon. 
tt0095256; Hilarious looking over-the-top 'punkers' terrorize and kill an innocent family, only to be stalked by a vengeful deformed son who was being kept in a secret room of the house. Just when it seems that this film is rolling into its conclusion, Tab Hunter makes an out-of-nowhere entrance, marking the starting point of twenty more excruciating minutes. GROTESQUE, which to this point was merely somewhat painful, now crosses the "near-lethal" line.Throwaway horror bunkum, and a sad example of how its once-promising star, Linda Blair, was somehow reduced to being a fixture in sub-B material.3.5/10 
tt0095256; Linda Blair is a professional, capable actress who pretty much livens up every film she chooses to co-star in (yes, even "Roller Boogie"). As for "Grotesque", well... Rarely have I seen such a sick, twisted piece of sludge. At her parents' mountain abode, Linda and family are attacked by a gang of punks so disgusting they'd give Sid Vicious the shakes! After watching her mother and best friend dragged off to their deaths and seeing her father beaten to death with a log, Linda escapes into the snow wearing pajamas. I almost gave up on "Grotesque" right here. What kept me watching? The identity of the mutant in the basement? The "F/X"-styled subplot about the dad being a Hollywood make-up man? No, it was Linda herself, keeping her dignity throughout all this grotesque-ness. It's a horrible, wretched movie--and I was surprised to learn that Blair served as co-producer! However, it IS somewhat better than "Savage Island". NO STARS from **** 
tt0095256; Linda Blair has the unique distinction of being associated with various kinds of horror films. She's been possessed ("The Exorcist" and "Witchery") repossessed ("Repossessed" and "Exorcist II: The Heretic") and stalked by a slasher ("Hell Night"), she's battled a witch ("Summer of Fear") played a witch ("Sorceress") fought zombies ("The Chilling") and, with "Grotesque", she visits the territory of Wes Craven's "Last House on the Left" and Meir Zarchi's "I Spit On Your Grave", low-budget revenge classics that went for ultra-realistic terror with utterly terrifying results. (Linda is to horror films what Dame Judi Dench is to period melodramas, she's practically turned horror film acting into an Olympic event. Her tireless efforts spent making horror films cause Jamie Lee Curtis to look like a slouch.) But here, she steps away from the monsters and ghouls of her career, and faces the ultimate terror: man himself, out of control and violent. With this film she has the chance to play her character's horror with total realism. Her performance is up there with "The Exorcist" as her ultimate victim role. She plays Lisa Krueger, a young woman traveling into the Big Bear mountains with her friend (Donna Wilkes) to visit her family. Her father (Guy Stockwell) is a Hollywood make-up effects man, and her mother a loving and supportive partner to him. On their way up to the house, the young women encounter a band of punks looking for trouble - in particular (and unknown to Lisa) they are planning to ambush and violate the Krueger home. They've heard rumors of a 'secret' up at the family's secluded mountain place, and are convinced that drugs and money must be involved (While the acting of the gang members is of uneven quality, they are eerily reminiscent of the Manson clan, and some of them even manage to rise above the clichA©s of the script and deliver something terrifying.) That same night the group storms the house and assembles the family, then begins murdering them one by one, leaving poor Lisa to witness it all. (Donna Wilkes, along with Blair, is a terribly underrated actress. She is terrific here - especially her death scene - and was also great in "Jaws 2" and "Angel".) At a moment when the villains are arguing among themselves, Lisa sees her chance and flees, but is cornered in a hallway and has no other option but to jump out the window. From there Lisa frantically runs into the snowy night, clad only in her nightclothes, with a couple of punks hot on her trail. Lisa's cousin Patrick, previously mentioned in the script but unseen, lives behind a bookcase in a hidden room. He is the 'secret' that the punks had heard about. He is hideously misshapen, and mentally handicapped. While he is a hulking, scary man, he has the mind and innocence of a child. He witnesses the atrocities against his family, and vows to exact bloody revenge. So he is a tortured killer, and we get to see his remorse over his own actions. Yet, he cannot stop himself. The loss of his family is too great for him to bear. He kills all of the attackers within reach, and goes out into the night to finish off the rest. Meanwhile, after running until dawn, Lisa is finally caught by one of the killers and strangled. Patrick catches up and kills the guy, but Lisa is unconscious and nearly frozen. Patrick is chasing the remaining two punks when the police finally arrive, and they assume that he murdered Blair's family. Patrick is shot and killed, and Lisa is taken to the hospital, where she must have a risky surgery in order to survive. Enter Lisa's plastic-surgeon uncle (Tab Hunter). As Patrick's biological father, he is outraged by the crimes and the killing of Patrick. The two surviving punks are taken into custody, and they claim that Patrick did all the killing. Uncle knows better, but only Lisa, who may or may not survive her surgery, can save Patrick's reputation, and put the two remaining killers behind bars. When Lisa dies during surgery, Uncle takes matters into his own hands. He kidnaps the two remaining killers and returns them to the house, where he uses surgery to permanently disfigure their faces, and locks them away in Patrick's old room behind the bookcase. Uncle also reveals that he too hides a horribly disfigured face, and therefore understands the true torture of his chosen method of revenge. This is a philosophical and ironic horror film, I can't think of another horror movie that tries to approach themes such as the remorse of the monster, the superficiality of 'beauty', and societal neglect of the handicapped. This movie works on a deeper level than I ever suspected it would, or could: it shows both terrible violence and the power of familial love, and it beautifully renders (thanks to Tab Hunter's touching performance) the fine line between sanity and insanity when an individual is blinded by a need for vengeance. The film has a very unique feel about it. The chase scenes during the cold, snowy night are absolutely realistic, and hauntingly beautiful, and quite reminiscent of Kubrick's "The Shining". Linda's jump out of the window is classic horror, devoid of any camp aspect, and, while brief, the overhead shot of her fall is pure, chilling brilliance. Her hospital scenes are evocative of her work as troubled Regan MacNeil in the "Exorcist" films. She is surrounded by many good players, but it is Blair who single-handedly keeps "Grotesque" together. Her work here is so intense that you feel her character's presence even when she isn't on-screen, and she remains a key character throughout most of the movie. She's the heart and soul of "Grotesque", and as such makes this micro-budget terror flick worth a look. 
tt0095256; "Grotesque" is a grossly under-performing creature feature.**SPOILERS**Taking a road trip together, sisters Lisa, (Linda Blair) and Kathy, (Donna Wilkes) go up to a mountain retreat to get away for a short vacation. When they meet up with special effects master Orville Kruger, (Guy Stockwell) who has done a lot of special effects work, and they reminisce about the past. When local gang-members Scratch, (Brad Wilson) Shelly, (Michelle Bensoussan) Donna, (Sharon Hughes) Gibbs, (Nels Van Patten) and Ear Box, (Billy Frank) show up at the house looking for money, they fight back only to be quickly shot down and put in their place. When they suddenly realize that a vicious monster is amongst them and killing them off one-by-one, forcing them to fend the deadly creature off. Realizing that something is amiss about it, they realize that there's a connection between it and the company they went after, making it harder to stop the rampage.The Good News: There wasn't a whole lot to this. One of the better parts is that, once the deformed guy breaks out he starts offing them pretty quickly. This is what leads to the best part of the film, the slaughter of the gang-members in a relatively quick period of time, happening quite quickly and really done in a great, brutal style. What's also great about the creature was the fact that it was so freakishly strong that it didn't even bother with weapons at all. A snap of a neck or bear hug was all that was needed to make short work of the victims, which makes for some great times during the rampage. In addition to these, we also get a really impressive facial crushing with the bare hands, a couple strangling and a really nice face blown apart by a shotgun blast, among other kills in here so this does get somewhat messy when it wants to be. The other good part is the fact that we're given more than one enemy, which also goes ahead to show a police-procedural side of the situation that's not normally presented. Once all the mayhem is over, a search party is sent out, complete with posse members and dogs, and after the survivors are found, they're questioned in a long, intense sequence which even plays off the good-cop bad-cop routine with them, which here is nicely handled is a different side that it usually given in these films. The last good part here is the really unique and clever plot, and even though it's basic premise is done to death, the play-out and execution of the tweaks done to it are fairly creative and make for some interesting scenes. These here are all that work for the film.The Bad News: This here was a pretty underwhelming film with a couple flaws to it. One of them is that the look of the creature wasn't as grotesque as might have been lead to believe. It basically looked like a human that had their face partially melted off, with the jagged edges, jagged ridges and obvious prosthetics sticking out over the eyes, cheeks and around the mouth, which doesn't really do much for me. There's a whole lot more grotesque beings in horror flicks, and in the end it just comes off as incredibly lame and cheesy. The big flaw, though, is that the movie should have just ended at the hour mark, because everything after that point just seems like a waste of time. For instance we have one sequence involving a man walking to the cabin, and we're continuously cut from him to the dead bodies inside piled inside. This is repeated until the man finally reaches the cabin, which takes entirely too long. It's pretty clear scenes like that are only there to fill up the running time, because there's honestly not much more story to tell at that point and the editing of it plays that they're discovering the bodies out of accident but taking an entirely too long to do something that simple. Then when you think the film is finally over, we're thrown an even more ridiculous, unexpected ending, but not in a positive way. There's almost nothing that can be said to put this into a positive spin, but this anti-climax has to be one of the worst endings ever seen in any kind of movie. There's very little left to say how stupid, ridiculous and annoying this ending is, which really just makes it hard to understand where it was going to going before this came in, but this ending totally obliterates whatever good it had and just really leaves the viewer stunned. It's just an all-around mess, and really obliterates what good had come before it. These here are the film's flaws.The Final Verdict: Bungled by the script woes despite having some really decent things, this one here is a really underwhelming creature feature. Really only see this one for the cheese value, have to see every single film from the creative cast or a fan of creature features, otherwise ignore this one completely for more redeeming fare.Rated R: Graphic Language and Violence 
tt0087739;  The version of this that I saw was 23 minutes shorter than the runtime listed in the IMDb, so, these comments may be only half valid.  It was a multi-lingual effort, with English subtitles when the dialogue was in French, German or Italian - no dubbing.  (The narration was in English.) Perhaps we are to be impressed with the language skills of the leading man. It's set in Monaco in the second half of the 1950s, about twenty years after the guy went from his native Germany to Washington, D.C.  It fits that this occurred because of his mastery of linguistics. But then he returned to the fatherland to participate in WW II, his memories of which are shown to parallel much of what he experiences today. Now he is a jewel thief, and, we share some of his encounters on the day after a partially successful swipe: while hitchhiking, he is picked up by a gay, martial-arts-accomplished, French-speaking John Claude van Damme, he woos a lady-photographer, who, it turns out, is a pick-pocket, herself, and he demonstrates that craft, with a trio of females as his victims.  My only negative impression is an occasional over-attempt at humor.  Otherwise, it's a fairly unobjectionable depiction on film.      
tt0087739; The Van Damme part of this short film-ette is one of its very short vignettes. One shouldn't try to discover a connection between the various part, but just enjoy each one as an independent project. As for Van Damme, he plays this role almost too well. Could it be type-casting? Might he be portraying his true self in an attempt to get this first acting contract? Ever since seeing it, I've wondered if the strong-man, super macho JCVD isn't just a great acting job. Good/Great actors, in any case, do just what a previous commenter complained about, they portray various types of people and obviously characters who may not be exactly who they are in real life. Gay or not, he plays the part well and personally I like to think he is! 
tt0087739; I only saw Van Damme's famous Gay karate man sequence and it was really funny . This clearly shows Van Damme, has a ton of potential to be in a Comedy film, however i won't watch the rest of the film, because it has no Van Damme, and is probably really unfunny. You get to see Van Damme's famous kicks, and he is very convincing as a Gay karate man!. A friend sent me a clip of this, however after watching it, i have no urge to see the rest of the film, as it's cheap looking, and looks very amateurish, however i did really enjoy the scene i saw, and i do recommend it to all Die hard Van Damme fans that want to see everything he has done (like me), so that's why i reviewed this. *** out of 5 
tt0063275; When I was in high school (the late 1970s) a local TV station showed this on Saturday afternoons constantly with "Dracula vs. Frankenstein". As a teenager I LOVED this! My memories on the plot are kind of vague, but it went something like this: A man is cursed with becoming a werewolf. He has already killed a few people. He hears of a count who can (perhaps) cure him. The count and his wife come--but they're both VAMPIRES!!!BTW--Frankenstein has nothing to do with this movie. The American distributor had promised theatre owners a film with the names "Frankenstein" and "Terror" in the title. Then they got this werewolf-vampire one. So the American version has a silly prologue linking the Frankenstein family to the werewolf!!!Sounds ridiculous but it's played so serious it actually is a lot of fun to watch. The effects (for the 1970s) were good and, surprisingly, this got a PG rating despite some pretty gory parts. Also this played uncut on TV. The acting was actually pretty good and I distinctly remember being terrified by the vampires.I heard the original Spanish one runs 10 minutes longer and was in 3-D and stereo sound! We'll never see that here probably and this version seems to have disappeared completely. Too bad. It was a fun, silly horror film. I give it an 8. Maybe Anchor Bay will find a version of this to release soon. 
tt0063275; First time in which Waldemar stricken by ancient curse that turn into Werewolf at the full moon . Paul Naschy is turned into a werewolf when an annoyed Wolfman attacks and bite him . Daninsky looks desperately for a cure . He along with his lover (Dianik Zurakowska)) and a young man (Manzaneque) seek help for a doctor . Meanwhile Waldemar goes on a murderous rampage every time the moon is full. They contact a strange couple (Julian Ugarte, Aurora De Alba)who tries to cure his Lycanthropy with incantation but they result to be vampires. First entry about Werewolf with the unforgettable Waldemar Daninsky-Jacinto Molina ,under pseudonym Paul Naschy. Continental Europe's biggest horror star again with his classic character and horrifying to viewer. Jacinto Molina Aka Paul Naschy ,who recently passed away, was actor,screenwriter and director of various film about the personage based on fictitious character, the Polish count Waldemar Daninsky. The first entry about Waldemar was Â¨The mark of the Wolfman (1967)Â¨ by Enrique Eguiluz , it was such a box office hit that Jacinto went on filming successive outings as Â¨Night of WalpurgisÂ¨, Â¨Fury of the WolfmanÂ¨ , Â¨Doctor Jekill and the WolfmanÂ¨ , and once againÂ¨The return of the WalpurgisÂ¨, Â¨Howl of the devilÂ¨, Â¨The beast and the magic sword(1982)Â¨ that is filmed in Japan and for the umpteenth time Â¨Licantropo(1998) and finally even directed by Fred Olen Ray in Â¨Tomb of the Werewolf(2004) with Michelle Bauer.It's a B series entertainment with abundant sensationalistic scenes and a Naif style.The movie has a bit of ridiculous gore with loads of blood similar to tomato and is occasionally an engaging horror movie full of fights, curses, and several other things. This time Paul Nashy/Jacinto Molina exhibits little breast but he was a weightlifting champion. Here Waldemar takes on vampires and werewolf in some moving fighting scenes. Pretty slow going, but hang in there for the Werewolf versus vampires. Regular cinematography in 3D and big screen ,70 mm, by Emilio Foriscot is accompanied by a lousy remastering. Filmed in Manzanares and Navacerrada, Madrid and Talamanca De Jarama, location in which were shot most part these horror movies. Eerie and atmospheric musical score by Angel Arteaga, saga's usual .The motion picture written by Naschy is middling directed by Enrique Eguiluz and regularly played by Jacinto Molina , a slick craftsman and mediocre actor.The flick will appeal to Paul Naschy fans and terror genre enthusiastic. Rating : 4,5 . 
tt0063275;  This film is absolutely NEVER aired on TV anymore and is nearly impossible to find on video. I remember seeing it several times as a staple on one of the numerous horror movie shows that used to air in NYC years ago (Creature Features, Thriller Theater, etc.) I would love to revisit it.As a cheapo horror movie buff (and veteran of the "old" Times Square horror/kung fu/blacksploitation double-feature movie houses), I've since learned that like many other European horror movies of the era, the version seen here in America (Frankenstein's Bloody Terror) is a truncated version of the original Spanish print. Stripped down from 93 minutes to just 78 minutes only added confusion to plot points that were vague or contrived to begin with. I'm keen on seeing the original version, but I'm sure the shorter randomly edited version is probably a lot more fun (as is often the case -- see The 7 Brothers Meet Dracula for another example).The only Naschy werewolf film that I've seen in video release is Fury of the Wolfman, which doesn't hold a candle to this movie in terms of pure kitschy so-bad-it's-good delight. 
tt0063275;  MORD39 RATING: ** (of ****)The first of many werewolf films starring Paul Naschy as the doomed lycanthrope, Waldemar Daninsky.Bitten by a werewolf, Naschy seeks help from a weird couple of specialists who are not exactly what they appear to be. It's a fun and very atmospheric movie to watch, despite its dubbing and low budget. With a tendency to confuse, it's not for every taste...but it's the perfect place to start for those interested in Spanish horror. 
tt0063275; So here it is, the movie that started it all. The first step in the unending saga of Waldemar Daninsky, the werewolf, that would launch Jacinto Molina's career of playing this character through the next four decades.The English-dubbed "Frankenstein's Bloody Terror" print available from Horror Theater Video begins with an amusing explanation as to why it was given that title, even though Frankenstein's creature isn't featured. Basically the narrator tells us that Frankenstein becomes Wolfstein, or something. Anyway, it makes absolutely no sense ... the real truth is that the American studio was promised a Frankenstein movie and received this instead, but decided to release it under that title all the same. Heh. Anyway, the picture is quality is quite poor but at least it's a decent surviving print of this historical werewolf movie, and the dubbing is actually not bad.Two gypsies take refuge in an abandoned castle, get drunk on some old wine that they find and ultimately end up doing a bit of good old-fashioned grave robbing, which includes removing a silver crucifix from the 'Wolfstein' tomb. Needless to say, they are quickly slaughtered. Kind-hearted nobleman Waldemar Daninsky joins the investigation, fascinated by the strange occurrences that surround the castle, and eventually encounters the beast responsible, who is stabbed with a silver dagger again but not before giving Waldemar a nasty bite. He tries to cure himself from his new infection, but ultimately puts the love of his life and everyone else in danger. His friend writes to a mysterious doctor who may be able to help him, but all is not as it seems ...Yes, it's completely exploitative ... but hell, it's a lot of fun and there's kind of a well-meaning innocence to it in a way, just a bunch of Spanish folk having some fun with the classic Universal monsters that they love. You'll probably even get a few laughs from some of the cheesy horror moments. The women mostly just run around screaming "look at how exotic and busty I am!", while along with the men they endure gruesome deaths. Jacinto Molina, sporting a full bodybuilder physique, gives a decent first performance as this character (particularly during the werewolf scenes) though obviously not as good as many of his later ones. The directing isn't great, some of the lighting effects are pretty laughable, and the editing is rather sloppy -- but it does have an effective, creepy soundtrack unlike many of the later Daninsky movies.Silly, creepy, nonsensical and fun. Along with every other Naschy movie, it's not for everyone, but if you do enjoy then you've got twelve more movies to check out. Which is nice. 
tt0063275; While it isn't the best and most fun flick starring the late Spanish Horror Legend Paul Naschy, "La Marca Del Hombre-Lobo" aka. "The Wolfman and Count Dracula" aka. "Frankenstein's Bloody Terror" (1968) is the first film in which Naschy played the Werewolf Waldemar Daninsky, and therefore the film that launched his career as an immortal Cult icon. In a way, Enrique LA3pez Eguiluz' film is therefore maybe one of the most influential Eurohorror films ever made, as it is not for certain if Naschy's career had been the same, had it not been for this film. It is an interesting detail that Naschy, who (as for so many of his films) wrote the story and screenplay to "La Marca del Hombre-Lobo", only took the role of Waldemar Daninsky because Horror star Lon Chaney Jr. had turned it down. Luckily so! As in the sequels, Waldemar Daninsky is a kind-hearted and likable man, to whom young beauties are magically attracted. Shortly after the ravishing 18-year-old countess Janice (Dyanik Zurakowska) falls in love with Daninsky, unfortunate events lead him to get bitten by a Werewolf, after which the likable man becomes a nighttime Werewolf himself...The 'Waldemar Daninsky' or 'Hombre Lobo' Werewolf films starring Paul Naschy all follow a very similar pattern in which the likable Daninsky becomes a Werewolf (sometimes due to a curse, sometimes due to unfortunate events), and yet each one of them is highly entertaining to watch, even after having seen a bunch of them already. Since this film was made in the late 60s, it is quite a bit tamer in terms of sleaze and gore than its 70s and 80s sequels (though there are some gory scenes), and may therefore be not quite as fun to watch to my fellow Exploitation fans. The storyline, then again, is slightly more logical than in most of the Daninsky flicks, and while the film probably won't make anyone shiver in terror, it has a moody Gothic atmosphere and several genuinely eerie moments. Naschy is great as always and young Dyanik Zurakowska, who would later play alongside Naschy in one of his greatest films "La OrgA­a De Los Muertos" (aka. "The Hanging Woman", 1973), is lovely in the female lead. JuliA!n Ugarte and Aurora de Alba are nicely eerie as a married couple of very sinister occult scientists.Even though some of the sequels, such as "La Noche De Walpurgis" ("Werewolf Vs. Vampire Women", 1971), "El Retorno De Walpurgis" ("Curse of the Devil", 1973), or "El Retorno Del Hombre-Lobo" ("Night of the Werewolf", 1981, my personal favorite so far) may be even cooler than this one, this is the original Waldemar Danisnky flick, and an absolute must-see for all my fellow Paul Naschy fans. Not to be missed by Eurohorror-lovers. Paul Naschy forever! 
tt0063275; Here we have the first in the Hombre Lobo series that made Paul Naschy, uh, famous. I admire Paul's desire to want to play a werewolf so often. I do wish, however, that he developed the special effects. He just looks slightly more savage than Lon Chaney Jr.'s version. I feel this film, in particular, is more suited to a 1950's audience.You have the usual Gothic trappings here: creepy old castle, gypsies, curses, strange bloodlines, werewolves, vampires, but....no Frankenstein or his monster! Instead, you get some nonsense about the Wolfstein clan. Exactly how that happens is rather interesting. It's like you ask for a Mercedes-Benz. I place one in front of you when you get your driver's license. Then, I drive it away, and have a Yugo towed to the same parking spot and say "It's still a car. Have fun!" So, while we were "terrified" by Frankenstein, in all his incarnations, now we have Wolfstein! That's basically how the story intro begins. Like, it's almost the same thing! Don't complain! Ha. Well, I'm actually fine with not having a Frankenstein monster in this film. This is one of those creaky old clunkers that is long on plot and short of wolf-outs. However, you do get something I bet kids would have liked back in the day: two werewolves fighting(I don't know how many times that happened in films before this one) then you have a werewolf tackling not one but two hissing vampires.Let me break it down for you. Boy meets girl. Girl meets Waldemar. Girl thinks Waldemar is hotter(who wouldn't?). Gypsies screw around in a castle and accidentally bring an old werewolf to life. Waldemar gets bit, thus begins his hirsute problems. While looking for a cure that doesn't involve death, two strangers show up, claiming they will help Waldemar, boy, and girl. But, they are just vampires, natch! Without spoiling the ending, yeesh, you have a fairly OK fight between Waldemar and the old grey wolfman, then a horrid laughable chase between the annoying man-vamp with all his cape twirling and hissing(seriously, he has like no powers other than biting and hypnotism--he literally and figuratively sucks) and Waldemar.The movie gains a few points for atmosphere and set design. Random skeletons strewn about are, well, unusual, I think, but overall the castle set designs are quite good, and Naschy is constantly walking into cobwebs accidentally. This isn't one of those so-bad-it's-good films. I don't think it deserves a lot of ridicule. Maybe watch it alone. You probably won't find many people who will "appreciate" it as you might.Time to get hairy. 
tt0063275; "Frankenstein's Bloody Terror" is one of the better European films of the Gothic era.**SPOILERS**A curse on the Wolfstein family causes the descendant Count Waldemar Daninsky, (Paul Naschy) to investigate a strange accident at an abandoned castle. While joining a local hunting party, he is the only one who escapes but suffers a severe gash on his chest. He finds that he can turn into a werewolf and asks for help, and keeps friends Rudolph, (Manuel Manzaneque) and Janice, (Dyanik Zurakowska) from discovering his secret. Janice decides to help him despite the problem, and decides to take him to see Doctor Mikhelov, (Julian Ugarte) who also has a terrible secret that is soon revealed to Rudolph and Janice.The Good News: The first film in the legendary Waldemar Daninsky series of films, and is one of the better entries in the series. It has a great combination of the European sleaze and American Gothic sensibilities. The film takes place almost exclusively in a castle allows for the always-impressive settings. The gloomy dungeon, long winding hallways, tons of long, winding staircases and plenty of other factors that are found in Gothic castles. The costuming and pace are also quite reminiscent as well, and combined with the marvelous castle settings gives this film a literal dripping atmosphere. The sleaze comes at the more exploitative elements thrown in, which mostly come from the werewolf's actions. The kills are brutal for the time, with the decidedly European blood and gore. It's got a great combination of the two. The pace is quite nice, and the big scenes are placed at the right moment to keep things from getting bored. The twist in the story about the way to deal with the werewolf is a great injection of originality into the proceedings, making this a bit more clever than the other films from the time.The Bad News: This is one of the hardest films to understand. It's not like nothing is explained, and many scenes doesn't seem to make a lot of sense. Waldemar is hardly given any back-story and his role in the proceedings changes a couple times. He at first is the creepy owner of a forbidden castle, then becomes a kind hearted person who invites a pair of wanderers to his castle, and switches to wanting to investigate when they go missing. It was given the impression that the events took place at his castle, then clearly doesn't know that the kills took place. It's just one example of a confusing series of story lines. It is most likely due to the differing prints out there, which is understandable. They're really isn't much wrong with it, just a confusing series of events.The Final Verdict: If films that look great but don't make any sense are your favorite kinds of films, then this will greatly appeal to those. The film is also recommended to those that love the European way of horror films and to fans of Paul Naschy.Today's Rating-PG-13: Violence and Sexual themes 
tt0063275; It's tempting to ignore the meaningless American title of "Frankenstein's Bloody Terror". I'm sure you're well aware that it has nothing to do with this movie. However, the fact that this was retitled into something so utterly wrong is sort of interesting in its own right, and a fond memory of the way low budget films used to be marketed in America. Not only this, it is an important film because it features Paul Naschy in his first starring role as cursed lycanthrope Waldemar Daninsky."Mark of the Wolfman" (the literal translation of the original title) veers wildly all over the map in its runtime, offering up the blueprint for the Naschy films that followed it, many of which had to do with werewolves running up against vampires. "Mark of the Wolfman" is a great beginning, but ultimately winds up being more silly than anything else.The plot shows a lot of the ideas and situations that would be used again and again in Naschy's films. Perennial Naschy character Waldemar Daninsky is bitten by a werewolf, an ancestor who has been accidentally resurrected and unleashed on the local village, and he finds himself tortured by his lycanthropy. The only way to be released from the curse is to be killed by a woman who truly loves him, and there is one conveniently in supply. There are also vampires who show up, in this case a male/female couple who pose as doctors attempting to cure Daninsky. For some reason, they really only want to torture him, as well as put the bite on the two humans interested in helping him.This part is where the film gets truly silly. These have to be the unscariest vampires to ever grace the screen. The male doctor is an effeminate dandy who'd give Lestat a run for his money, while his undead wife has a hairdo that resembles a parking cone. The lady vampire is dispatched fairly easily enough, she's not very adept at hiding her coffin during daylight hours. The male vampire runs off with the sexy damsel-in-distress in an attempt to escape. "Running off" for a vampire apparently requires that the cape be fully extended on both sides at all time, something that looks very silly on camera. The Count does a bizarre dance while trying to get away, and it goes something like this: run a little, swoosh cape over female, stop running and turn back while extending both arms so that cape looks like giant bat. Repeat at random.But you've got to admire the bravura of the whole thing. They throw in so many horror movie references and clichA©s that it gets to be dizzying. It's interesting to see the way Naschy's vision combines distinctly European techniques with inspirations obviously from the classic Universal horror films of the 30s and 40s. The sets are great to look at. Most of the action takes place in a large Gothic castle, with some effective lighting reminiscent of Italian horror films. You can spot some obvious fog machines gushing fog just off camera, which is amusing. But not all of it is silly. The hunt for the original werewolf in the first act of the film takes place in the Black Forest, which is photographed exactly as in Dario Argento's "Suspiria" years afterwards. There are a few shocking scenes involving the violence of the werewolf, too, including one poor guy who gets tossed, bleeding, into a fireplace, where he catches fire and spits up blood on himself."Mark of the Wolfman" is of probably mostly of interest to fans of Naschy's work, and the current RareFlix DVD transfer is great. It's a great example of the kind of weird film that you'd typically see at a drive-in, at least in America. The poor pacing of the film makes it a little boring, even for the seasoned viewer, so I can only imagine what people thought of it when they encountered it as the second or third feature on a bill--especially when they were expecting Frankenstein to have at least something to do with it. 
tt0063275;  First of all, this is a VERY difficult film to find in any condition, and I am afraid my endeavours obtained a print put out by Video Search of Miami that was grainy, subtitled in German(odd for a Spanish film), and rather bleary through much of it.  I searched long for this print, and despite its many flaws, both with the copy and with the film, I must say that I enjoyed the film overall.  It has very high marks for atmosphere with its superb European gothic castle and its slyvan night settings.  The acting is pedestrian at best, and the plot about an ancient family curse of lycanthropy is somewhat muddled.  Apparently an old family, suitably called Wolfstein, was populated with a werewolf named Imre Wolfstein.  Some traveling gypsies come by the deserted castle and steal jewels from the dead family members in the vault, even taking the silver-pointed crucifix embedded in the body of Imre.  Of course, this allows Imre to come back to life and rid the castle of those pesky gypsies and other villagers.  In the wake of his feeding, he bites Waldemar Daninsky.  The story really starts here as Waldemar and friends try to rid him of his new affliction.  Thinking they are getting expert medical help, his friends enlist the aid of two vampires, who are up to no good.  As you can see the plot has something for everyone.  Well the film has lots going against it, but the atmospheric mood and settings, and the fact that this is the first of the eight Waldemar Daninsky films starring Paul Naschy are reason enough to grab some popcorn, light some candles, and sit back and enjoy some hokum. 
tt0097905;  Lately I find myself hopelessly over the hill, frantically scrambling for vestiges of my long-gone youth to validate my current adult existence. Being that I'm only twenty makes this kind of hard, and besides, I spent my adolescence watching the Gilbert Gottfried magnum opus USA Up All Night. I remembered that as a youngster I enjoyed the Up All Night staple "Monster High", which usually aired after "Dr. Alien" or "Surf Nazis Must Die".Watching it again now, I found it pretty stupid. I think the reason that I liked it as a ten-year-old was that this movie seems to have been made by ten-year-olds (not unlike "Bats"). It's packed with corny jokes and pointless scenes, and has some pretty awful acting, even worse and over-blown than Shannon Elizabeth in "Scary Movie", and that's no easy feat.However, I must applaud the sheer volume of stuff that they packed into this, a "quantity over quality" sort of thing. This movie has got a mummy, a zombie, a killer computer nerd robot, a walking gargoyle, a huge, sentient clump of marijuana, shoes that eat people, and two aliens so annoying they seem to have come from Planet Charles Nelson Reilly. These ghoul's ring-leader is Mr. Armageddon, the embodiment of all evil, who kind of looks like a doughy, aged Corey Feldman. Oh, I figured out another reason that I liked this- there's a cute girl playing the female love interest. What's odd is, the girl and her breasts are played by two different actresses, so every time a scene calls for nudity (which is often, remember, this was made by ten-year-old boys) they cut to a disorienting shot of a headless torso. This made me wonder: The gal playing the lead was pretty awful actress, but they wanted her so desperately that they were willing to let her use a body double? There was no other actress that was just as bad AND would show her breasts? Weird.Anyway, this is a pretty simple-minded, innocuous bit of entertainment. The people making it were probably having a lot of fun, and there are a few funny bits (like the finale's "basketball on the rim" gag, worthy of a "Naked Gun" movie). If you're a little kid or a heavy drinker you'll probably love it.   
tt0097905;  Well, I attained a copy of this movie off Ebay, remembering watching it from the good ole USA Up All Night days...True campy hiliarity!  This movie is stupid, funny, hilarious, and a down right good time to watch.  Nudity, blood, monsters, aliens, nerds, horny teens, drugs, kill pot plants, the most hiliarious names every given to characters....there is so much wrapped into this movie, it seems it could explode from so much camp.It is sad to see this is the only movie the Director ever made...He truly had an Eye for Horror/comedy...I want a DVD release of this film...It should be kept underground...Mainstream this bad-boy...I want deleted scenes, Commentary, etc....I love this movie..9 out of 10 
tt0097905; Wow. Just... wow. If you are into schlocky horror films, then this is just beyond words. Everything you ever wanted is here: Killer shoes, zombies, strange directing (some characters open up an elevator door and some girl is getting killed as a strobe light blinks and someone sits on a pie or something -- what?!), and plenty of t&a. Oh, and don't forget Satan. And a guy whose voice is overdubbed to sound really evil. And really, REALLY cheap FX. And computers who kill people. And rapping aliens. And amazingness.I mean, the plot of this movie is simple: Earth is about to be taken over, so people play basketball to decide the fate of the world. If this DOESN'T sound amazing, then this isn't the film for you. However, this film is AMAZINGLY entertaining, hilarious, and just completely over-the-top. In a lot of ways, it's similar to Troma films (especially Class of Nuke'Em High) except it is even more clever, and there actually seems to be an attempt on the director's part to make something more out of this film than a cheap B-movie.I really don't know why more people don't know of this film since it used to be on USA's Up All Night, but you can easily snag a copy off of Amazon for a dollar. Really, I can't say it enough: The best trashy B-Movie horror/comedy/whatever film ever. See it now.10/10. 
tt0097905; Monsters and demons. High school. The end of the world. A prophet of doomsday. A bit of gratuitous nudity and sex. A little bit of gore.That pretty much sums up Monster High, though I failed to mention that the effects are so low budget they're laughable, the acting is (intentionally?) hammy and the whole movie is full of camp and cheese. And what can I say about the plot? Maybe that there isn't one. Oh yeah, and the humor is really quite silly and juvenile, and it's got that "Eighties" feel to it that really dates it.Well, all that makes it sound like this is a bad movie, and I guess it is. It's nowhere near the worst movie I've ever seen, but it is a fun, low budget over the top horror comedy that isn't going to win any best picture awards in the near future. But it did make me smile and even laugh a few times and was fun enough that I don't feel I wasted my time.Not for everyone, but if you like campy, silly, low budget horror comedies, then this might just suit you. 
tt0097905; Bad movies can be hilarious! They can make us laugh or in some cases cry, and they later are remembered as hilarious cult gems that people quote in everyday life. That seems to be the ultimate goal of the awful film, and only certain movies ever make it to that level. Some make it to a much smaller cultish level of bad where friends gather to watch it and laugh, but most have never heard, nor want to, of the movie. Then there's movies like this. You start off saying, "Boy, I know this will be horrible, but I bet I'll get a good laugh!", and by a mere 20 minutes in you just pray this thing will be ending very soon. This is a very annoying, and awful movie, and the overload of humor results in an audience sensory overload where everything goes dead, except for boredom which stays very much alive.Nerdy 35 year old student Norm is quite infatuated with foreign exchange student Candice Cain, but oh no!, the end of the world is coming! Mr. Armageddon, a voice modulated ugly middle aged creeper who molests and kills the students at this high school is going to end the world. This weirdo was freed from his prison by two flamboyant aliens, Dume and Glume, who go around this same school zapping people with their stupid looking guns. Meanwhile all kinds of crazy stuff happens at this school like a mummy coming to life, a killer pot plant, a tennis shoe monster, and many other ridiculous creatures.It's hard to decide what to criticize first with this thing, so I'll go with the least discussed first. This movie has some truly unbearable music! It sounds like bad early 80s video game music, and made this cornball movie even more cornball than ever imaginable.The acting in this is really bad, but compared to most other aspects of this movie, the acting is quite masterful. The actors are actually speaking with straight faces so they get ten points above the writers and director. The characters are stupid, and not funny in the least. There is a random narrator guy who apparently is Mr. Apacolypse's relative, and he is the most random unfunny guy ever, and the actual female narrator has a horrible speaking voice. She sounds like a voice over for a cheap early 90s VHS trailer. Nothing about this movie is remotely funny in any way at all. The lack of plot makes this thing boring, the acting is atrocious the writing is also, and this movie nearly bored me to death. Don't see it!My rating: BOMB out of ****. 84 mins. R for constant nudity, language, drug use and sexuality. 
tt0097905;  I found this movie very amusing, it's use of off-beat and cheesy humor is absolutely wonderful!  I thought the abstract storyline was very well put together, and is not your typical 80's high school movie.  It has all things that make a great movie, blood and gore (check out the excellent microwave scene!), nudity, campy humor, and it even has a killer pot plant!  I highly recommend this movie to anyone.  If you ever see it in your local video store, check it out, it rocks! 
tt0097905; This is an awful movie and I'm surprised that I managed to make it through 58 minutes of this garbage. This movie tries to be funny, but it fails miserably. This a B movie and I enjoy B movies even though many of them can be considered bad, but this movie is not even so bad it's good. It is so bad that it's just bad. The action, costumes, and character ideas are idiotic. Mr. Armageddon's voice is ear grating and I don't understand why he couldn't have a normal voice. I guess this movie is good for people who like boobs in movies because that is almost all this trash has. This is the worst movie that I have ever watched in my life and that is saying a lot. It's saying a lot because not all B movies that I watch are winners and I have seen many of them. 
tt0097905; Two bald aliens arrive on Earth with the Doomsday Device, something they have stolen from their own alien planet, much to the behest of the Monster-in-Charge. They unwittingly unleash Mr. Armageddon (David Marriott) upon an all-American high school, and soon this long- fingernailed-bringer-of-doom is busy a-rapin', a-killin', and basically a-f****n' with every kid in the school. Dorky loner Norm (Dean Iandoli) is too busy lusting after foreign exchange student Candice Cane (get it - played by Diana Frank) to notice the arrival of horny gargoyle statues, the living dead, and deadly giant marijuana plants. But when he does, he strikes a deal with Armageddon to have basketball game to end all games, and possibly the world.I'm sure you can gather from the description that this isn't a film to take too seriously. It's a very 80's high school horror/sex flick that is very aware of what it's target audience wants - blood, tits, and goofy humour. And it delivers all that in abundance. It has everything a shlock hound could want. Where else can you find a monster with a computer for a head? Or a teen that gets eaten by his shoes? Or alien twins that were failed rappers on their own planet? Probably nowhere. This is of course an awful film. But where it lacks in subtlety and intelligence, it makes up for in sheer volume and creativity.The edits come thick and fast. The film cuts back and forth between different characters and locations as if it were filmed by a giddy teenager. This approach certainly keeps the film fun and interesting, which is undoubtedly the sole aim of the film. Fans of Troma will love it, as will fans of 80's teen sex flicks such as Porky's and zero-taste gross-out comedies a la Animal House. Special mention must go to the creation of Mr. Armageddon, who dons a crap cape and a long pinky fingernail, and has a voice which is deeper than Barry White. Clearly actor David Marriott, who had a short career starring in B-movie action films, is having a great time, as did I watching him. I feel guilty that I liked this film, as it is indeed awful. 
tt0097905; I saw this movie when I was eleven years old (when I liked basically every film I saw for some sort of reason) and thought it was the worst movie ever. Nowadays I'm not sure which film is worse this one ore urban menace, one thing is for certain though both have to be seen to be believed. So my advice is to buy both of em you should be able to find both of them really cheap and their worth every penny!!!! p.s. the true worst film ever is of course pearl harbor, but that one is so bad it isn't even funny anymore (in fact I don't think of it as a film, movie, flick or any of those I personally think it's what getting you soul ripped out of you must feel like) whereas these I think were intended by the makers to be so stupid you just have to see them and are still funny after repeated viewings (although not in a row!!!) 
tt0097905; When I worked on this movie in 1989 I was new to the business and could tell nobody was out to make a masterpiece or win any awards except maybe in a few cases and then masterpiece would be the wrong word. (Some that worked on this movie have gone on to win big big awards) I am trying to say that on any movie most of the cast and crew (above the line included) work hard and it is well known that it will be great if the movie is released at all, in any market or format. (I suppose some might hope just the opposite, thus the Alan Smithee credit). "Monster High" was just a comedy and was not trying to hard to be great. Just to be fun and silly and great in it's own way. I think, IMHO, it did just this. If I remember right anything that would get it a R rating such as nakedness was shot after principal photography was finished. (I am not sure what it's final rating is) It was a lot of fun and hard work and I had a easy job kind of... DTz'r 
tt0139649; The premise for the movie has been done, or at least has been "heard" to have been done in films like "Life or Something Like it. The difference here is what happens, or more specifically what doesn't happen, and in my opinion, this film is far more superior. Kaneshiro plays Kenji - the tragic hero of the movie, who is informed by Death that he has less than 24 hours to live. I forget the exact number. The subsequent actions follow him around for the next day, and allows the audience to see what he would do with that knowledge.People may find this movie pretentious or more precisely that "nothing happens." And they're all right. However, if one were to take the time to digest the film after watching it, you will realize the deeper truths that it reveals. Please excuse me if this sounds artsy-fartsy.If you were told that you had one day to live by Death, I think many of us would react very much like the main character: be consumed by disbelief and inertia and "waste" time by doing nothing. I think it's more hits closer to home than we would like to admit. Unfortunately, life isn't just filled with earth-shattering revelations and exciting flashy monologues, unlike Scrooge in a Christmas Carol. It's mainly us - filled with our thoughts. We are not the consummate Shakespearian tragic hero with one huge flaw. People have many little ones. And the meaning of life and all our problems can't be solved in one night, no matter how romantic that ideal might be.Oddly enough, I find this film to be a slice-of-life and quite realistic, despite the premise. Kenji goes into a coffee shop regularly to find a man sitting there alway reading a novel by some great author. Kenji often watches him but is afraid to approach him, to ask him what novel he is always reading. With his newfound knowledge of his impending death, Kenji does things he wouldn't normally do, which is obligatory in such films. However, the revelations that are "revealed" for a lack of a better word, are not big deals, but are instead, little insights to what makes us truly human - pretension, postering, lies and how we pretend to be more than we truly are.I really liked the casting of Kaneshiro. He has that listless artist look to him, that fits the character very well. However, I really disliked Sorvino, as I thought her whole motive for taking the role was to showcase her knowledge of the Mandarin language.So ultimately, this is a hard film to review and even describe. It is slow. It can leave viewers with a sad emptiness. For some reason, it reminds of the novel, "Flesh and Blood" by Michael Cunningham and maybe even "The Rules of Attraction" by Bret Easton Ellis. You see the flaws of characters very clearly. You feel as if you hadn't learn anything about them except that they are unmotivated and vain creatures - things which you already are informed in the opening sequence. Therefore, it came as a complete surprise at the end of the movie, the amount of emotion I felt. So I think the film succeeded in drawing emotions that I wasn't even sure were there, perhaps it is the empathy we feel for ourselves and each other. 
tt0139649; First of all, the movie's setting is a multi-ethnic New York City. Our hero,Kenji, is part of a great mix of foreign-born/U.S. racial minorities/gay & straight people. His Japanese accent and his best friend's Italian accent are just part of the fun. Ethnic stereotypes are jokes.Kenji really, really wants to fall in love, but seems to be living just on handouts from his parents. His Italian friend fancies himself a filmmaker, but has a job selling movie tickets. They're living on dreams and illusions, but I wouldn't call that aimless, would you? (!)Second point -- The story is told in a very interesting way. Part of it is dreams, part of it is real life, and in parts, the dreams sort of push into real life. It's not that hard to keep track of, tho. The story is told chronologically and only takes 2 days.Third -- the actors are uniformly wonderful. The supporting roles, especially Ben Gazzara, are so memorable it almost seems crazy not to veer off on each one. Then there is a whole string of cameo bits that stick in your mind -- the "Balzac man," a pseudo-intellectual guy in the cafA©, will make you laugh -- the transvestite hooker -- the fortune teller -- there must be 20 of these gems! Fans of Mira Sorvino and Takeshi Kaneshiro will not be disappointed. As a very sexy Death, Sorvino shares with us her viewpoint, one that's not so hard to understand after all. We can see that it's natural that Death would have her favorites (not that it would be any great consolation). Her interactions with her 2 assistants are pretty hilarious.Kaneshiro's trademark blend of funny and intense makes him so rewarding to watch. No one can say he's weak or uncertain as an actor, and that was really important to this movie. He communicates a lot through his expressive attention to the other actors, but when it comes to the pivotal scene where he speaks out, his words are extremely powerful.Last -- the ending of the story takes us by surprise, even though we have known how it would end through much of the movie. It happens in a way we wouldn't have expected.Best of all are the interesting things that occur to us as we watch, like what does knowing you're going to die really change? There are lots of foreshadowings that prepare us for the main action (for example, everybody reminds the love interest, Pola, of someone else who turns out to be kind of relevant). It's hard for anyone to see this movie without suspecting there was more in there than they were able to catch.(Remind me to look up Pola Negri) I think there are plenty of people who would love this movie, and hope this helps you know if you're one of them. It's a serious story but very enjoyable. 
tt0139649;  The aimless protagonist is an all too believable character, and therefore there is considerable empathy for him, even when his behavior is not justifiable.  This film really gave me something to think about, how many people would do better than Kenji if given 24 hours to put their life in order?  In traditional Hollywood, everything would miraculously work out fine, but of course Wonsuk Chin knows better than that.  This is a case where I think a bitter flavor is better than sweetness.  Not all of the loosely-linked scenes work, and Sorvino can grate at times, but on the whole the movie is very much worth seeing.  The opening is wonderful.   
tt0139649;  This movie is like a moving dartboard. details flash before you and as you aim your attention on a particular target, it quickly goes out of reach.I just rented this flick among 6 others (saw Wall Street before this one, really good movie) simply because Mira Sorvino is a hottie and the premise of the film (guy gets 12 hours to do whatever he wants) sounded intriguing.It turned out to be something a hell of a lot different.From the opening credits I was impressed with the set-design, the actor and the way it was being filmed. Fantastic opening scene gave me the feeling I was going to watch something really unique. And I did.Unfortunately, I cant quite find the words to describe what I saw. It seemed almost like an improvisation. Characters that didnt quite seem to fit in the story, conversations that didnt seem to hold any relevance, plot-twists that were inconceivable. This isnt your typical hollywood film.Again, I was taken aback by the style of the movie, and I recommend this for those seeking something "different" to comment on along with their friends. Just like "Lost Highway" had an important message locked somewhere in it's tangled skein.Oh well. That pretty much sums up my opinion of the movie, sorry I couldn't have done a better job. peace out. 
tt0139649; I was looking forward to seeing Kaneshiro Takeshi in an English-speaking role, because I've always wanted to see him in US Movies. Moving away from my initial reason for watching this, I was deceived by the "comedy" label attached to it (much like I was tricked by Spanking the Monkey) and was looking forward to a nice romp when it opened with an old Baghdad myth about Death.The start was slow and I was a little leery about it, until Sorvino showed up after the chase and the film really sped up.I have to say, I didn't like the "German" actress at all, although I was amused at Kenji's reactions to her. I did like the cafA© guy and the Italian friend, but that's because their pretensions make them feel better about themselves, even if they're mostly falsehoods. Other than the German woman, the casting was interesting and very diverse. I bought it because it was New York City. If it had been somewhere else, it would have been more questionable.Of all the characters, I loved Kaneshiro's awkward, rather withdrawn, and just clumsy self. Sorvino was also excellent, though, especially in the dream sequences. Personally, I was curious why she spoke the Chinese (yes, I know she speaks it), but didn't do the Japanese in the dream sequence. (Maybe because she looked awkward in the kimono?) The filming itself was interesting, mostly because it felt jerky, and awkward, much like the main character. It isn't as bad towards the middle and end, and I rather feel it's because it was trying to pick up momentum with the story.The storyline is rather simplistic, but it seems right. Like mentioned elsewhere, Kenji dithers and wastes his time. He asks questions, but doesn't really listen to the answers. He now demands attention and affection, but he doesn't find it until the very end. Overall, the simplicity was all the better for the character and story. Complications were thrown in by showing shots of Death and her Minions' interactions with humans and their discussions about them and their role. I think it was interesting.My other (small) annoyance was that the subtitles were not accurate in the DVD version I had. I mean, it was translating Chinese, Japanese, and French, and it did an adequate job with the Japanese, but somehow butchered the French.Overall, it's not really a comedy, but it's hard to label it a tragedy either. The fleeting aspect of life is highlighted in this film, and how we should appreciate little things. How over thinking things can, in the end, can destroy us. I liked it. It was an interesting ride. 
tt0139649; Sure, in some ways this film is artsy-fartsy. Just imagine: a Korean director making a movie about a Japanese in NYC whose best friends are an Italian would-be filmmaker, and a German girl who eludes early on. And Death herself announcing she will take him in a few hours.But still: I kept thinking of Franz Kafka's saying, "A book should be an axe for the frozen sea in us", and for me, this film was that axe. I had many "unbelievable" and a few laugh-out-loud moments. (Hint: the fortune tellers.., the Concorde and time-zone issues..) And quite some thinking afterwards. Oh, and the lovely films-in-the-film: one silent, one in 1950s Japan style..Weird but so often quite plausible story, and so many hitting ideas (or just observations). I loved it very much. 9/10. 
tt0139649;  i just finished watching "too tired to die" on cinemax. i had seen the commercial for it earlier today, and it looked like it was a good watch. basically, a japanese slacker, played by takeshi kenshiro (from 'chungking express' - another excellent movie), is approached by death, played by mira sorvino, and told that he has 12 hours to live. from that premise, i figured it would be your basic lark of a movie, seeing how a slacker deals with the fact that he has half a day left to live.it wasn't quite the hour and a half of hijinx and hilarity that i'd expected.not to say that it wasn't good. it was. i just --- it was one of those movies that ends and i'm not quite sure just what i'm feeling. one of those movies without an actual crescendo or climax or resolution, or anything. not your typical movie vehicle. and so, now that it's over, i have no idea what to feel. i mean, it basically followed his 12 hours, and the surreal, bizarre events that take place. i can't even discuss it or how i feel about it or talk about what happened, because i don't want to spoil it for whomever might be reading this. it was just one of those movies that leaves you hanging and yet, at the same time, doesn't. it was a little confusing, and a little ... i don't even know.i can't help but feel that i missed out on something in the movie. like it was some art piece that somehow escapes me. that i can't quite understand. which is funny, because that exact premise came up in the movie, where kenji (the main character) is looking at a piece of abstract art and asks the artist if it's possible to like something without understanding it. i guess that's how i feel about the movie. i liked it, and i know it was a good movie, but i can't understand it. and i can't help but wonder if i'm missing out on something bigger because i can't understand it. for maybe it wasn't even meant to be understood. after all, isn't the purpose of art to create different meanings in different people? each person who views it, who experiences it, creates their own interpretation of it. maybe it wasn't intended to be understood. just watched, enjoyed (and i don't even know if i enjoyed it. if that makes any sense. i know i liked it, but did i enjoy it?), and appreciated.maybe this is what the director had in mind. maybe this is what he wanted? for the audience, after watching it, to just sit and not know what they feel. whether or not they enjoyed it, or understood it, or even knew what the hell just happened.i know i want a copy of it, though. i know that i want to be able to share it with people, and --i just called a friend on his cell phone. told him to remember the name of the movie, and try to catch it on cinemax, or watch it. i need someone to share it with. discuss it with. someone to help me understand it, maybe, i don't even know. it's just too --- god. it's a mind f*ck, and emotion f*ck, a head f*ck. i couldn't even form coherent sentences on the phone, while trying to explain the movie to phil. i feel like i'm some sort of messed up, bizarre drug, that's how messed this movie has me. i don't get it. it was such a ... non-movie movie ... and yet it's got me so affected. it just WHAM hit me. maybe it's just me. just some weird emotional state i'm in that was triggered or enhanced by the movie, but i can't remember being this -- shaken, moved, affected, bewildered -- by a movie. i keep rambling on, spewing words onto the computer, hoping one of them will help describe what i feel, but so far none of them are even close to it.  
tt0139649;  I did not like the movie. It was a very promising one but I think it got out of the hands of writer/director. It could well be that writer director wanted to do exactly that, in that case I would say that writer director was not very well seasoned at that time.Maybe the next one come out better than this one. Acting was very good, script very poor. Alas, it could have been a minor classic... 
tt0139649;  It's about death, this movie, and the struggle to find meaning to one's life, when having only a few hours to do it. Big subjects, indeed, worthy of a great artist - needing one, really. Writer/director Chin doesn't suffice.The film plays with classic themes, related to this topic - such as the chess game with the reaper in Bergman's 'Seventh Seal'. Bergman's knight loses the game, but wins the lives of those he has learned to hold dear. In this movie, nothing is gained, and so one wonders: is anything at all lost?There's an interesting atmosphere in the film, sort of an arty New York setting through an immigrant's eyes, but neither that nor anything else is really followed through. What must be meant to have some profound undercurrent, remains just surface - and a quickly sketched surface, at that. It would have been better to make this film a pure comedy. 
tt0139649;  A film with a really interesting premise and obviously some provocative ideas behind it. Unfortunately it goes nowhere from there and  particularly towards the end becomes tiresome and violent.The best part of the film is by far the character of Death played by Mira Sorvino. 
tt0052840;  Not historially accurate, but a great portrayal by Sal Mineo.  He worked with Krupa for about 2 years before filming began.  The only real flaw is that the music is a 1950's version of 1930's swing/jazz, and none of Krupa's hits of the 40's were really included.  Nonetheless, the music is very good, with Mineo mimicing extremely accurately Krups's off screen drumming. 
tt0052840; If you've ever wanted to be a drummer this is the film for you. Even if the sounds of percussion instruments leave you with a pounding headache, it's still a good film to watch, for the acting and for the general atmosphere the film evokes.With a straightforward, linear plot, "The Gene Krupa Story" highlights some of the career events of the legendary drummer, from his high school days in Chicago until his comeback from the depths, following an unfortunate incident in San Francisco. Krupa comes across in the film as outgoing, ambitious, single-minded, determined, and unable to handle success.The story spans roughly a twenty year period from the late 1920s to the late 1940. Sal Mineo has the title role ... and what an acting job! In scenes with dialogue, his performance is intense, subtle, and very convincing. But, when Mineo mimics Krupa's frenetic drum solos, Mineo's performance is electrifying.Both Susan Kohner as Krupa's love interest, and Susan Oliver as a femme fatale with attitude, further elevate the overall acting level. And the B&W cinematography from Charles Lawton, Jr., combined with smoke filled rooms and jazzy/blues music, is wonderfully suggestive of the beat generation of the 1950s, even though we are supposed to believe that it is an earlier era.On the downside, the story is only partly factual. Production values are hardly better than average, and the editing is at times sloppy. The film has an inexplicably abrupt ending.Overall, I recommend this film for the jazzy atmosphere of a bygone era, and especially for the high quality acting. "The Gene Krupa Story" is worth watching, if for no other reason than to marvel at Sal Mineo's ability to bang the drum briskly. 
tt0052840; Imagine that it is 1970 and they have just released "The Frank Sinatra Story" with then 20 year-old David Cassidy playing the Italian crooner from ages 17 through 47. If that sounds weird imagine that the production designer on the film never shows up and they film it as if everything from 1935 to 1965 looks (and everyone talks) like it is set in 1970. Finally imagine that to preserve the 1970's look, all the action takes place inside, with one short scene on an indoor sound stage with fake grass and trees. That is essentially "The Gene Krupa Story", with bobby soxer heartthrob Sal Mineo replacing Cassidy, Krupa replacing Sinatra, and the look of 1959 replacing 1970. Mineo was the Cassidy of his generation, with about the same level of acting talent but harder working and more willing to take direction. Like the imagined "Cassidy as Sinatra" film, the idea was to expand the target audience by including someone who would attract teen and pre-teen girls. In this "The Gene Krupa Story" was successful and the film had good box office. The downside was that big band fans generally considered the whole production laughable. My father was a huge Krupa fan and he hated this film with an unprecedented passion. In part for the cheap production design and in part because of Mineo and the reasons for his casting, but largely because of the many factual omissions and distortions. To him the only saving grace was that they used Krupa's actual drumming, to which Mineo is generally in sync although there are times when he is beating a tom and the sound is that of a cymbal. Like most Hollywood bio movies ("The Lou Gerhig Story", "The Al Jolson Story", etc.) Krupa's mother was violently opposed to her son's ambitions, in this case she and her husband want him to be a priest. But he leaves the seminary to set out for New York with Eddie Sirota (James Darren) and Eddie's composer girlfriend, Ethel (Susan Kohner). After a rough three months Ethel is forced to take a job as a telephone operator and her romantic interest switches to Gene. Gene's career takes off and he begins running with a fast crowd of 1930's musicians (who sound strangely like a Maynard G. Kreb's take on the 1950's beat scene). A jazz singer named Dorissa Dinell (Susan Oliver) connects him with some dope dealers and the film gets a lot like "Reefer Madness" (but with a 1959 setting). Which may account for a surreal montage of newspaper headlines chronicling his rise to national fame and his fall in a drug bust. There is even an "I told you so" phone call from mom. This has ramifications beyond Krupa as the entire jazz world is outed as dope fiends and corrupter of America's youth. When the chips are down, Dorissa bails on Gene with the classic exit line: "Now if you'll excuse me, I've got a town I'd better get out of." Gene is reduced to playing in strip clubs with other beatnik musicians wearing dark glasses. When it seems like he can't go on another day Ethel re- enters his life and things begin to break his way once again. For the aging sequences Mineo could draw upon the example James Dean, who he worked with in both "Rebel Without a Cause" and "Giant". Dean was faced with the same challenge in "Giant" and Mineo's attempt here is clearly superior. So much so that what could have been the film's biggest liability is actually a strength. And Mineo successfully mimics Krupa distinctive drumming style and facial expressions, details that he worked on with Krupa himself. There are seven drum solo set pieces, mostly medium shots that capture the spirit if not the actual magic of a Krupa performance. Susan Kohner shows considerable range in two of her 1959 films, this one and "Imitation of Life". Here she will remind you of Eva Marie Saint's "On the Waterfront" character, a considerable contrast with the overwrought racially conflicted daughter she played in the other film. The likable James Darren (later to star in television's "The Time Tunnel") is a better singer than an actor. His scenes with Mineo are pretty awful, certainly the film's worst moments, and the fault does not lie with Mineo who tends to play up or down to the level of whoever he shares a scene. The hard working Mineo simply did not have enough talent or training to salvage a scene gone bad and really needed to be surrounded by a strong cast to help him sell his characterizations. Susan Oliver ("Butterfield 8") gets the best role and has a lot of fun with her character, benefiting from having almost all of the film's good lines. "Snow me again, junior, because I didn't quite get your drift." Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child. 
tt0052840; Sal Mineo, who made a career of played conflicted people, does a magnificent job in the biography of legendary drummer Gene Krupa.Mineo, as Krupa, gets wonderful support from James Darren and Susan Kohner. 1959 was a remarkable year for Miss Kohner. It was that year where she received a best supporting actress nomination as the troubled daughter of Lana Turner's maid in that great film "Imitation of Life."Krupa's family wanted him to enter the priesthood. However, Gene's calling was for being a drummer. As is the case with so many talented people, success came quickly and unable to handle it, Krupa descended into a life of drinking and using reefers. At a time, when there were investigations revolving about musicians and drugs, Krupa's career suffered from his conviction and serving time in prison.While Mineo at age 20, may have been too young for the part, he does a very credible job as the tormented youth. Kohner, as his girlfriend, Ethel, never gave up on him even though he literally walked out on her before his troubles again. As she did in "Imitation of Life," Kohner shows her own emotional conflict. Her early retirement from films deprived Hollywood of an excellent talent. We also lost a great talent, when Mineo, who would get possibly the best part of his career as Dov Landau,the following year, in "Exodus," was murdered in 1976.Lawrence Dobkin, who in 1959, was an important player in the television series "The Untouchables," scores well here as a protA©gA© of Krupa. Celia Lovsky, who was so memorable in many old films, usually portraying elderly women, was wonderful in 2 scenes in portraying Krupa's disappointed but loving mother. Of course, a Jewish woman playing a Catholic mother, might have raised some eyebrows at that time.This is an excellent film where the social mores of the time derailed Krupa's great talent and career. 
tt0052840; Competent, slick and well photographed, but fairly banal treatment of the famous drummer.Almost no attempt is made to visually set the story in the twenties and thirties. Thus, the film abounds in an abundance of visual anachronisms, including fifties architecture, decor, and clothing, (Misses Kohner and Craig wear Dior style shirtwaist dirndls throughout, whilst Miss Oliver wears Capri style cocktail pants!--nowhere is there a cloche hat, aigrette or dropped waist). Only slight sartorial concessions are made for the men, (a few bowler hats and double breasted vests) These inaccuracies no doubt accrue from the fact that the picture is being pitched wholesale to the 1959 teen audience and not to their parents.For his part, Mr. Mineo does exceedingly well, though at times he does lapse into hipster posturing, (in his finger pointing angry scenes he appears to be imitating Ben Gazzara). Given his extreme youth, however, he demonstrates more poise and depth than his teen idol peers. The only really embarrassing moments come when he is depicted as a cassock clad seminarian in prayer.If nothing else, this film provides your only chance to see Sal Mineo in spats. 
tt0052840; I give this one three-and-a-half stars: one for Krupa's off-screen drumming, one for Sal Mineo's credible imitation of Krupa at the drums (makes one wonder what Mineo's drumming sounded like), and one for Shelly Manne's appearance on screen as Dave Tough. The rest of the movie cumulatively rates less than a star.Musician film biographies are known for their "artistic license," but this one was so far off the mark as to be ridiculous. So many inaccuracies in the plot, I can't begin to list them. Even the musical selections were incredibly off the mark. And it's hard to believe that Krupa saw and signed off on this script or the rushes, because the movie made him look like one of the music world's shallowest, most self-centered, and destructive creeps. He was no angel, but he wasn't the showboating Satan pictured here. 
tt0052840; The Gene Krupa Story plays at times more like a Lenny Bruce sketch ("So that's what reefers look like!") with Sal Mineo coming over like Martin Scorsese on speed as the first superstar drummer, James Darren proving that he's no singer while Red Nichols is at least 30 years too old to play himself. At times almost aiming to be a Catholic version of The Jazz Singer (even though Krupa's family behave like classic Jewish stereotypes), it's formulaic, watered down stuff, both factually and musically, but not without some undemanding entertainment value, not to mention a likable performance from Susan Kohner as the good girl who stands by him. And Susan Oliver's hophead singer gets a great exit line: "Excuse me, but I've got a town to get out of." 
tt0052840; Always enjoy listening to the great talent of Gene Krupa along with Buddy Rich. This is a film dealing with Krupa's childhood which dealt with his becoming a Priest and then a world famous drummer in the 1940's. Sal Mineo, (Gene Krupa),"Rebel Without a Cause",'55, did a great job of trying to imitate Gene on the drums along with Susan Kohner,(Ethel Maguire),"Freud",'62, who was his girlfriend and loyal supporter through out this picture. This film portrays the good and bad times of Gene Krupa and most of his bad times were caused by a frustrating childhood and a great love of his mother and father, who both demanded too much from their son. Great Class film along with great musicians. 
tt0052840; Mr Krupa should have seen this one coming.After the success of his ex-boss's biopic "The Benny Goodman Story" it could have been a choice between him and Harry James who had the added kudos of being married to Betty Grable.For whatever reason they picked a charismatic gum-chewing tousle-haired stick juggling drummer with a colourful history and a pot bust over the straight-laced trumpeter with a movie star wife who was probably contracted to another studio.That's Hollywood I guess. Mr Sal Mineo who could chew gum with the best of them and tousle up his hair real bad learned to juggle his drumsticks.Apart from a chubbiness in the cheeks he resembles Mr Krupa physically.Mr Krupa was an easy-going guy by all accounts,and certainly the first white swing drummer of any consequence.Like BG he was an early employer of black musicians in his band(Roy Eldridge - outstanding on Krupa's "After you've gone"). His best - known singer Miss Anita O'Day appears in the movie,following up her success in "Jazz on a summer's day",and,frankly,is the only thing worth watching.Whilst BG was well treated in his film,Mr Krupa isn't. On the grounds that there is no such thing as bad publicity he may have decided to leave well enough alone,but anyone coming to the movie cold could be excused for thinking he was a complete prat,which wasn't in fact the case."Drum Crazy" is trite and sensationalist,cheapening the memory of a man who,in his day,was a huge star.I hope he laughed all the way to the bank. 
tt0052840; Gene Krupa was before my time but I had heard what a great drummer he was. After watching Sal Mineo play Gene Krupa, I was so impressed that I wanted my husband to see the movie. He also thought Mineo was great in the role. My husband did some checking on the movie and learned that Sal Mineo had spent 2 years with Gene Krupa studying his moves and expressions for the movie. Gene Krupa also played the drums for Mineo during the movie. My husband said he had read that Sal Mineo was a very hard worker for the part he played in the movie. It's a shame that he was murdered in 1976 by a two-bit petty thief that didn't even know who he was. 
tt0105183;  What wasn't magical about this movie?  Futuristic sex combined with phenomenal special effects and massive amounts of cigarette smoking made this sci-fi thriller a hit!!!  With the star power in this movie, I knew I was in for a treat.  I mean, Brenda Swanson and Prototype...what a stellar line-up!!  I became even more intrigued when I discovered that this was actually the third part of the Terminator trilogy.  This became evident when access was granted about two thirds into the movie.  Finally, I'd just like to say this movie was part man, part machine, and ALL KILLER!!! 
tt0105183; Not long ago, I discovered there was one last old-fashioned video store in town, with an action/sci-fi section stocked heartily with tapes from the 80s/90s. I love robots, and going by the android-looking figure on the tape jacket and a vague promise of action, I rented this movie under its Canadian release title of "Prototype X29A". I mean, come on, I'm only 19. That just sounded cool! Watching it with my 14-year-old brother in tow, I was more hoping it would be so-bad-it's-good (like, think of Kickpuncher from Community), but not long into it, I was starting to wish I rented "No Man's Land" just to see young Charlie Sheen.My hopes were high during the opening scene, which takes place in the once far-off year of 2057, and has some really nice atmosphere and delightfully terrible fighting. Everything changes as soon as we cut to 20 years in the future, focusing on a colony of mostly old people and some punk-looking young adults. The story seems to focus more on a young woman (only clad in a weird bra-shirt for this film) who was a toddler during the opening scene, her teenage surrogate brother, and a guy in a wheelchair who looked like John Taylor. A priest was trying to kill the teenage boy for no reason, John Taylor was playing with an erotic sim game (at one point he clicks on an option that brings up a male partner, the one thing that actually provided amusement for me beyond the prologue), and a lady who looks a lot like Lara Croft is on a computer for most of the film. And some guy kept getting into fights, and breaking necks was his only move.It's boring, painfully so. I don't mind a lot of exposition, but here all essential information would display on a computer screen in a font that looked nifty and hi-tech in the late eighties. It bumbles around aimlessly, throwing handfuls of characters and bizarre events in your face (i.e. a card game in a saloon with a meth addict Tom Hiddleston lookalike). It even got borderline nasty at times, too, with one scene where our female lead is either prostituting to or about to be raped by four guys. The first assailant says to another, "USE MAH SKIN" and pulls off his used condom...yikes, the movie instantly was in bad favour with me. It tries to blend action, scientific themes, apocalyptic settings, eroticism and general sleaze into one package, and the result is as palatable as expired milk. (Mind you, I loved "Heavy Traffic". Violence and sleaze can be good when they're not slathered all over.)I didn't finish it. I feel really bad admitting this, but it was one of the few movies that were so unappealing I just had to stop. I'd give it one star, but the trashy opening and one laugh provided some entertainment. If you need to see something cheesy and 80s, I'd rather you looked up the Malofilm Video and Vidmark Entertainment indents, which displayed at the beginning of the Canadian release. They're adorably dated, but my point is, two home video indents should not be better than your whole film. 
tt0105183; I know where it all went wrong. The cover. Prototype's tape cover shows a fake-looking robot standing against the background of a virtual reality grid. Instead it should have been showing a couple of lovers with expressions of suffering on their faces and some kind of dramatic quote. The movie should not have been called "Prototype" but rather something like "Desert Roses". It would have attracted a different kind of audience and would have perhaps been much better received.Even if the people watching this B-movie do not admit to having any expectations for it, they are subconsciously expecting to see indications of some genre. Yet they receive none because Prototype can't pick a genre. Well then is it like one of those smart genre-transcending films? Well no, not really. Firstly, because it is not smart and secondly, Because even those kind of movies are clearly about something and generally pick a piece out of each genre on which to base the storyline and Prototype doesn't really get its footing in any of the genres. However if we tried to pinpoint a genre, it would most definitely not be an action movie, but a drama. It is a poorly executed one.The story is about a problematic couple getting caught up in the leftovers of a vague futuristic conspiracy. The setting is an 80s post-apocalyptic sci-fi world.There are multiple aspects of the story that could have been much better developed. It is not that the movie does not have enough material, like some have suggested. It is that the makers did not do enough with the material at hand. There is a whole movie out there about nothing more than a guy who gets his hand stuck in a rock, and it managed to keep its audience interested. Prototype is just poorly executed. The few action scenes are laughable. The stuff in between the action scenes doesn't have enough expression, contains horrible camera decisions and is in desperate need of better dialogue.Having said that, the movie is somewhat underrated as it does have an interesting style and the acting, which this movie heavily relies upon, is not that bad. Unfortunately its style is a slow one, and unless you have a lot of patience with pessimistic sci-fi dramas, you will not like this.I wish someone redid this movie and gave it life rather than a zombie existence. 
tt0105183; I consider myself to be a major contender in the terms of low budget science fiction, i'm not one to brag but when I was a teenager, the movie clerk would say that I was keeping him in business by renting the obscure flicks that basically came and went without much of an impression. Prototype X29A (Which I guess is titled Prototype) is a movie that reminded me a lot like the equally dull Nemesis, in that it seems to labor to tell a story that has lots of heart and excitement but fails in most regards. Actually there are some okay moments that surface, for one of the characters is admittedly likable. The guy in a wheelchair has our sympathy, he wants to become a robot so he can have his true love but this is all abandoned for stupid quirkiness which add little to the story and nothing that is interesting. Plus the whole rebel underground subplot and the totalitarian government are clichA©s borrowed from Albert Pyun. I actually saw Prototype X29A in a double-bill with ROTOR, at least ROTOR (While admittedly far worse) was hilarious to watch. This one was just a decorated bore with little merit.*1/2 out of 4-(Poor) 
tt0105183; Buwahahahaha...Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, before I begin to review this sh*thole of a movie, I'd like to present with you this fun and amusing little tidbit I found on this website.Phillip J. Roth - the maker of this movie, has a portion of himself on IMDb. I'm almost one hundred and damn percent sure that, after seeing this load of BS on my television screen, either he paid someone to write up his biography, or he did it himself. It begins by explaining, briefly, his humble beginnings and mentions two movies of which I just rented ('borrowed', if you will, since the place I was getting them from sold them for a quarter). "Both of which have amazingly intricate and well-woven time-travel story lines." If by 'well-woven', you mean, have a crippled man jerking off to a VR pornography device (he browses and smiles wide at the thought of necrophelia for a good moment, before wanting to hit up some ugly blond) and characters wandering around aimlessly around Los Angeles 'wanting' to fight a non-existent war against... nothing in particular, then, alright. You go ahead and believe that. Somehow I can't quite imagine a 'future', in which all robots wear codpieces, suspenders, and Darth Vader helmets.It goes on to say he "amazingly" writes, produces, and directs this. Uwe Boll, I believe, does the same thing to his movies. And I guess we can all figure out about his own reputation. If this biography is to believed, maybe they should get into the boxing match! Haha HAAA! "Perhaps this injustice," it explains, about why his movies only go to TV and home video, "is because of apathy of behalf of the 'average film fan' who would rather watch some brainless action than 'truly thought-provoking' cinema.'" Obviously this dumbsh*t didn't watch the better robot movies 'Terminator', 'RoboCop', and 'Bicentennial Man'. I mentioned the last one, because it says he's still working. Roth? If you're listening, stop lying to yourself, and quit Hollywood. Quit making movies. Quit everything, and shoot yourself. 'Prototype X29A' is a fitting title, since the whole thing practically borrows everything from every other movie, and adds strippers for recognition.Notice how his bio was written by 'Anonymous.' Yeah, he totally wrote that. Sorry, chum. 
tt0105183; Prototype X29A is a direct-to-video, science-fiction film that really should not have been made. The film, which is about an ongoing war between two species of cyborgs, is nothing more than the perfect example of what happens when you make a film with material that is only worth about 15 minutes. I'm surprised that the film's director has continued his film career when he should have stopped. The film has nothing in the way of plot, just characters sitting around, smoking, typing away like there's nothing else to do, until a scientist decides to finish off something he started 20 years earlier. The Praetorian's Verdict: D- - Hopelessly inept. 
tt0105183;  Very rarely does there come a movie which I consider to be completely without merit.  I even granted Godzilla (1998) some points just for being a fun night out.  But this movie...  boring in a very special way.  If you'd like a guaranteed cure for insomnia, feel free to check it out!  
tt0105183;  I am a big movie fan. I VERY rarely fall asleep during movies of any sorts. I find it disrespectful, and an insult to the makers of the movie. This movie falls into the occasion that makes me say "I RARELY fall asleep." I FELL ASLEEP!! Only the second time I have paid for a movie, and fell asleep during it!! What does that say about the movie? NOTHING!! It says nothing about this movie. I was SO tired of watching this movie, that what little of a plot there was to begin with IMMEDIATELY fell apart thirty minutes into this money pit. This movie was induced by, and causes the same thing, boredom. So at least there is SOME thing that links us to the movie. I cannot see this being made with high expectations on the part of the director, producer, cast or computers used in this movie. I could easily see the computers reaching for their self destruct button when the writer typed this script into the computer. Here's the best I could come up with for a plot. I'd give you a better one if I had the courage to watch the movie again:There are these things called Prototypes that were created to destroy a group of renegade robots called Omegas. The movie starts with a so-called Prototype roaming through a wasteland of scrap metal while a bunch of people scramble around trying to shoot it with whatever weapons they have. They are toasted. Thus goes to show, no matter how big a gun you have, someone has a bigger one. The Prototype begins searching for the last remaining Omega he can detect, which is some guy down in a damp dark basement with one computer (get used to dark rooms filled with lots of moisture and lots of smoke. This does not flatter any actor's physical appearances throughout the movie). The guy has what appears to be his young daughter with him, and he tells a servant to take his daughter away. He links up to the computer using a very Matrixy looking plug-in to the back of his neck, and sees the Prototype coming. He just waits in the room and it comes right on in, and kills him. Nothing very flattering about the whole scene, he just kills him.Well, next thing I know (it's all a big blur really) we see some guy sitting in a wheel chair with a mullet (Ugghh...) named Hawkins, smoking in a dark, damp room. Some kid with a bow and arrow comes in begging for something called a processor, and this Hawkins guy gives it to him, even though he says that the little kid's sister TOLD him not to give it to him. He gave it to him, even though the girl he obsesses over told him not to. This guy really needs to get a life.Next we see some lady walking into this dark, dank room with a backpack on, looking a lot like Lara Croft... that is, if you ever wanted to see Lara Croft extremely sweaty. She talks with this guy (totally unintelligible) and begins tapping away at a computer (*Yawn*) Let me let you know as a bit of a side note, this movie has some of the worst music to date. It's played at the audibility level of about one decibel and it's horrible. I actually think this movie could have been saved if they had put good music... no, great music into it, due to the lack of dialogue this movie seems to provide us with.Now, we take a total change in the movie, and half way through it, decide to introduce new, relatively important characters. All we see of them though, is when someone tries to take some of their stuff, and the bigger guy snaps all three of the guy's necks. And with about five people scattered about him no less! I guess in the future, murder isn't as big of a crime as it is today. Oh, another side note about the movie. This movie depicts the future as having LOTS of old people. I'd say there is about a 4:1 old person, young person ratio. Example: The apartment building the Hawkins guy lives in is run by an old priest who constantly wants to kill the young kid with his gun. And sitting on the apartment's lounge couch are two old people, one of which has died, it's just that nobody seemed to notice.The next scene I remember is probably the most important scene of the movie. It starts with two guys endlessly playing rock/paper/scissors. What does that say about the future? Pretty bleak, eh? Afterwards, it pans to Chandra (we soon find out she's the guy's daughter from the beginning of the movie, as if we really care at this point) and she's prostituting herself to four men at the same time. I mean, COME ON!! This is terrible. But you know what? You know what? Here comes the best part about the future... GUYS SHARE CONDOMS!!!! ARRRGGHHH!!!!!! KILL ME NOW!!!! All that happens after this doesn't matter, except that the sweaty Lara Croft makes an offer to Hawkins to let him walk again, so he goes into this thing where they transform his body into the shell of an old Prototype, and he walks around again. But it scares Chandra because she doesn't recognize him for obvious reasons and so she tries to shoot him. All the while Hawkins inside the Prototype, is trying to suppress urges to kill Chandra, because it turns out she is the last Omega... Da da daaaaa!!! But, he doesn't do it. Then that guy who kills people for touching his stuff comes in, nearly kicks Hawkins' butt, but Chandra stops him, so Hawkins kills him (What tha?) and then Hawkins pulls off his helmet, walks outside while the barely audible music plays, and slumps to the ground, dead I guess. By this time, I was pulling out my hair, looking for the explanation someone owes me for making this movie.All in all, this movie was well worth the $2.50 I spent to buy it. My obsession with bad movies was looking for pain and anguish, and I guess I found it in the form of Prototype x29a. Now, it's off to the incinerator to add some new fuel, in the form of Prototype x29a, to the fire!! Wow, looking back on all I wrote, who knew that someone could write this much about this bad of a movie! Good day Gentlemen... 
tt0105183;  How'd she end up in this movie?  It doesn't make sense?  Isn't she supposed to be an Indiana Jones type?  Then why do they make her sit in front of a computer terminal the whole movie?  Sure is a waste of her talents... 
tt0105183; I honestly believe this is the worst movie I've ever seen. I am a B movie activist but this is the worst ever. Do not watch under penalty of law. You have been warned!Here are the questions you should ask yourself / points of interest for this movie.1. What happened to the cities and society that made the world this bad? They never tell you. 2. They never explain that Hawkins Coselow is Chandra Kerkorian's lover. They only way you would ever discover this is if you read the box. 3. From the box. "The experiment goes out of control and the prototype goes hunting for Chandra whom he is programmed to kill." If he is programmed to kill Chandra why would the experiment be going out of control when he begins to hunt her? 4. The explosive climax they promise on the box never happens ... why you ask? The prototypes were only made for one reason, to kill the omegas. Chandra is the last omega. Where does mankind's existence hang in the balance?Here is my personal title for this movie which is much more appropriate.HAWKINS GETS NEW LEGS 
tt0028517; Apart from a wonderful plot, superb acting from Katherine Hepburn, Herbert Marshall as a charming leading man, as a historical film costumer, this one goes on my A-list.I've only seen about 3/4 of the film -- caught it on Turner classic movies channel and got hooked. Don't know what the costuming in the early part of the flick was like, but from the time I tuned in, which covered the mid to late 1860s through the 1890s, I was VERY impressed.The 1930s and 40's "golden age of Hollywood" was not a particularly good era for accurate costuming in film -- the artistic/visual impact generally seemed to trump any concerns about authenticity. And the 50s, 60's and 70's got broadly worse.This film stands out from the 1930's crop BIG time.The 1865-1870 period is difficult to get right and is seldom portrayed -- elliptical hoops, small bonnets, tailored details -- all presaging the "first bustle era" of the early 70's but not yet at the bustle stage. Costume Designer Walter Plunkett gets it right and designed some lovely, authentic gowns. The film seems to flash forward pretty rapidly to the late 1870's to early 1880s "natural form" era and then the 1890s, so both bustle eras are missed out, but the periods he covers, he does RIGHT.Ironically, this is the same Walter Plunkett famous for his gorgeous, yet woefully inaccurate costumes for Vivian Leigh in Gone With the Wind -- however, if you look at that film, the costuming for Melanie Wilkes and the supporting & background women is actually pretty good, as are the various male civilian outfits. Alas, the stuff that's most remembered is the stuff that's wrong - Scarlett's clothes and the godawful uniforms. Suggests to me that the great Plunkett richly deserved his reputation, DID understand historical costuming and must have been working to some broader artistic judgement call on the part of either the director / production designer or producers on GWTW.With no such constraints on "A Woman Rebels", he did a phenomenal job.-- Kathryn Coombs Historical Wardrobe, Ltd Historical Entertainment, LLC 
tt0028517; Katharine Hepburn stars in an early feminist melodrama co-starring Herbert Marshall. The film is noteworthy for not only its lush production and excellent performances, but also the ahead of its time, and novel, depiction of women's rights and suffragists of the 19th century. Hepburn is so good she lights up the screen. Marshall, as always, delivers perfect support. The story is interesting, the cast is appealing, the sets and costumes are magnificent, the direction and cinematography are sublime, and the screenplay is intelligent and literate. Unlike many films of the 1930s, this one doesn't have a tacked on sexist ending. It's true to the women's rights cause through and through. Of all of the historical melodramas I have seen, this ranks with the best. It rises above the (condescending) 'women's picture' genre because of the timelessness of its theme. 
tt0028517; This is a classic "chick flick". A real old-fashioned tear jerker.Quite good Hepburn, actually. A perfect part for her- it encompasses all the complex and varied facets of her screen persona. Its surprising this movie didn't do better at the box office. Too political or controversial for 1930's audiences? Herbert Marshall as the love interest is excellent as well.Although the film deals with a variety of women's issues- discrimination in the workplace for one, the real subject is the shame of having a child out of wedlock. It is hard for modern audiences to appreciate how much stigma was attached to this as recently as 40 years ago. Three lives are profoundly affected by the need to keep this secret.One negative: the actress who played Hepburn's daughter was a disappointment. Too old and lacking the grace and beauty of Hepburn herself. Just goes to show how rare true star quality is. 
tt0028517; In the pantheon of feminist films that Katherine Hepburn did in her career, A Woman Rebels definitely belongs. Even though this Victorian costume drama failed at the box office, seen today it's manifesto for the feminist cause and altogether proper for the daughter of a suffragette to have brought to the screen.Kate and her sister Elizabeth Allan are being raised as proper Victorian ladies by their widowed father Donald Crisp which means no rights at all. Liz dutifully accepts her lot, but not Kate. Liz accepts David Manners a young naval lieutenant as a husband picked out by Crisp, but Kate has a fling with Van Heflin that's left her pregnant. And Heflin's engaged to another proper Victorian lady to boot.Kate goes off to Italy to live with her sister while Manners is on duty. Allan is also expecting, but after Manners is killed in action, Allan dies of a broken heart. On Allan's deathbed she and Hepburn decide to raise Hepburn's expected as her niece rather than her daughter.Back in the United Kingdom, Hepburn goes to work for a woman's magazine and under her direction the publication becomes a feminist manifesto for its time. Still old sins have a way of coming back to haunt one and they do Kate in a most peculiar way.Herbert Marshall is in A Woman Rebels as Kate's faithful suitor and British nineteenth century diplomat. He looks earnest and faithful much like a pet collie, but in fairness the role isn't all that much. One can certainly see what attracted Hepburn to A Woman Rebels. It's very message was parlor talk in the Hepburn household when she was growing up. Still the film does have a lot of unresolved situations, mostly due to the Code being firmly in place now and flexing its censoring muscles.Kate's co-star Van Heflin was pretty unknown at this time and she would pick him to co-star with her as well as Joseph Cotten in The Philadelphia Story when Hollywood pronounced her box office poison. Though she didn't pick him for the screen version, she was the one who got him an MGM contract when she went there and from there Heflin became a star.A Woman Rebels is a story which probably would have been better told now than back in the day. Perhaps someone like Gwyneth Paltrow will take up where Kate the Great left off. 
tt0028517; A WOMAN REBELS (RKO Radio, 1936), directed by Mark Sandrich, from the novel "Portrait of a Rebel" by Netta Syrett, offers Katharine Hepburn the type of role most suited for both her talents and personal interests, that of a feminist fighting for equal rights. Rather than a biography about early fighters of the feminist movements as Virginia Wolfe or Susan B. Anthony, A WOMAN REBELS takes a look at a fictional character named Pamela Thistlewaite.The story, set in "England, the middle of the Victorian era," introduces Pamela Thistlewaite (Katharine Hepburn), and her younger sister, Flora (Elizabeth Allen), living in Gideon Gray estate with her widowed father, Judge Thistlewaite (Donald Crisp) and humble Aunt Betty Bumble (Lucile Watson). Tutored by their governess, Piper (Eily Malyon), Pamela, with her thirst for knowledge, questions authority to why "women are inferior to men." Because of her outspokenness towards her disciplinarian father ("If you are unjust as a father, you must be equally unjust as a judge"), Thistlewaite decides to have his daughters introduced to society where they are to meet young men as prospect husbands. During a gathering, Flora meets and falls in love with sailor, Captain Alan Craig Freeland (David Manners), whom she marries and settles to Italy. As for Pamela, she encounters Gerald Waring Gaythorne (Van Heflin) with whom she becomes interested. Meeting secretly in England at Madame Tussand and Sons Exhibition Wax Works, they eventually have an affair before Pamela learns too late that Gerald is married. Keeping her pregnancy a secret, Pamela, accompanied by Aunt Betty, takes time away visiting with Flora, also expecting a child. While at her residence, Pamela meets Alan's guest for the weekend, Thomas Lane (Herbert Marshall), with whom Pamela becomes good friends. When Flora later learns Alan has been killed in an explosion at sea, the shock causes her to lose both her child and life. Raising her daughter as Flora's child, Pamela returns to England where she breaks all barriers by seeking employment. She finally lands one at Ladies Weekly Companion where she submits articles to William C. White (Lionel Pape), her publisher. After meeting with a young woman (Molly Lamont) struggling through life with a baby and no husband, Pamela, who sees herself in this girl, takes a stand by writing articles on woman's suffrage titled "Shame of Civilization" to instant success. While Lane wants Pamela as his wife, she turns him down so not to have her past ruin his political career. Years later, as her "niece" grows to womanhood, young Flora (Doris Dudley) meets and falls in love with a young man part of Pamela's hidden past, later leading to a scandalous trial.Considering the many novels and motion pictures bearing the theme of women birthing children out of wedlock and raising it as a child of another, A WOMAN REBELS offers nothing new in that regard, yet it's a wonder why it didn't prove successful at the box office. Weak scripting/ unsatisfactory conclusion, perhaps. Dreary underscoring, maybe. Time period? Not quite. Three years later, Bette Davis starred in THE OLD MAID (Warner Brothers, 1939) bearing a similar theme in same basic era, this time on American soil during and after the Civil War, resulting to something much better and highly effective. Hepburn, most noted for costume dramas as LITTLE WOMEN (1933) and THE LITTLE MINISTER (1934), was facing a career slump by this time, following previous failures as SYLVIA SCARLET (1935) and MARY OF Scotland (1936) to her name. While Hepburn's first mother role might or should have shown great promise, it only added insult to injury to being her third flop in a row.Of the Hepburn flops, A WOMAN REBELS, one of her lesser known and discussed projects from the 1930s, is actually better to some extent, with honorable mention to Donald Crisp's forceful performance of a cold-hearted, stern father treating his children with indifference because they're females. David Manners, Hepburn's love interest in her screen debut of A BILL OF DIVORCMENT (1932), has little to do in his final movie role. For Van Heflin and Doris Dudley (who sometimes resembles Joan Fontaine), both in film debut performances, only Heflin, given the film's most memorable line, "Hatred can hold two people together more stronger than love," went on to become as a accomplished actor with Academy Award best supporting win to his name in the 1940s. According to Bob Dorian, former host of American Movie Classics, where A WOMAN REBELS aired regularly prior to 2000, Hepburn wore 22 different Walter Plunkett designed costumes covering the Victorian England era (1860s to 1890). Costumes may have been the fashion for Hepburn, but its authentic historical Victorian-era setting gives this another plus. While Hepburn was allowed to age through the process, the make-up department avoided the common overplay of white hair and extended wrinkles over a more natural approach. Herbert Marshall, who comes late into the story, makes a satisfactory suitor who claims, "These modern women are so weak." Elizabeth Allan's meek sister role, though small, equally balances that of Hepburn's forceful manner.Once available on video cassette through Blackhawk Video in the 1980s and currently on DVD through the TCM Archive Collection, A WOMAN REBELS can be found whenever shown on Turner Classic Movies.

tt0028517; Katharine Hepburn did "A Woman Rebels" in 1936, when she was under contract to RKO Studios. She had a string of not so successful films prior to this, although made a sensational debut in "Bill of Divorcement" in 1932 and the wonderful "Alice Adams" in 1935. Hepburn basically plays herself here, all theatrical mannerisms and that light, slightly shrill voice. We are not so sure how to take the character of Pamela, although we guess from the title she will make some sort of stance for women's rights, circa mid-1800's, and indeed she does. Donald Crisp has a nice turn as her cold dominating father, and a young Van Heflin as one of Pamela's suitors is barely recognizable. Herbert Marshall is good as the man who loves Pamela through many decades. The soap suds are laid on pretty thick, and the film is not one of Hepburn's more memorable films. Still, for true Hepburn fans, it is always good to watch her in the earlier days. Fortunately for Hepburn, better roles were ahead in the decades to come. Hepburn leaving RKO was the best thing she did for her career. 
tt0028517;  Katharine Hepburn shines as always in this entertaining film that tries to focus on the raise of feminism in the last mid-century. The subject is interesting enough and so is the personality of the main character, played consistently by Miss Hepburn in a mixture of strength and frailty, but unfortunately this ends being a soapy melodrama. Extremely watchable,  but could have been a more relevant approach to feminism.  
tt0028517; This 1936 RKO film stars Katharine Hepburn as a young woman who rebels against the social mores of Victorian England. She begins by defying her autocratic father (a not so nice Donald Crisp), has a baby out of wedlock, and becomes a crusading journalist. It really was ahead of its time! To enjoy this film, you must like "old Hollywood" movies -- those in the era just before GWTW and the watershed year of 1939. This is one of those truly old films, although not as primitive as some film from the early '30s. Nevertheless, the plot is a good one.This was the film debut of Van Heflin, and I have never understood just how became a popular film actor. I still don't after seeing his first film. On the other hand, it was interesting seeing a young Herbert Marshall, long a favorite of mine. Elizabeth Allan -- why was she this homely in this film...she usually was quite attractive...perhaps the hair style. Katherine Hepburn does very nicely here, but be sure to remember how she looked as a young girl at the beginning of the film, compared to the mature lady at the end of the film...a remarkable transformation.Interesting photography of coastal Italy...or as we call it, Carmel, California. ,-) Very worth watching to see why this (and a couple of other flops) made Hepburn "box office poison". I can see why it may not have been popular back in 1936, but it wears well, and is great if you're a fan of either Hepburn or Marshall. 
tt0028517; This isn't a great movie by any means, but for what it is, "A Woman Rebels" is very interesting and of interest to cinema buffs, feminists and history students. It is a picture of the changing perceptions of women in society, and who better to be the star of such a film as the very independent Katharine Hepburn? Hepburn and Elizabeth Allan ("A Tale of Two Cities", "David Copperfield") are sisters as different as night and day, and this is of great concern to their very strict widowed father (Donald Crisp). Their very prickly companion (Eily Malyon) reports them for offenses which brings Crisp's wrath down upon the two girls. Only the devoted Lucille Watson shows them any compassion, a role she will continue to film throughout the film as the only mother-like figure they've known since their own mother died. Hepburn falls in love with rebel Van Heflin and Allan marries the stable David Manners, but tragedy strikes when Hepburn visits her sister in Italy. Now left to raise a child she claims is her sister's, Hepburn returns home, and instead of fighting with her father becomes an independent woman and begins a career, originally without pay and with a male pseudonym, on a women's magazine which until she came along printed nothing but domestic articles on subjects no more confidential than needlepoint.Only two years after the production code came in, this film dared to cover the subject of unwed mothers with dignity and class. Even though it never mentions it, the subject is obvious, particularly with a young woman who visits Hepburn at the newspaper to get help for her ailing child, only to send her a cryptic letter later with tragic overtones. "Shame!" Hepburn screams at society in her column, ripping up the oh-so important story on needlepoint, "a career for respectable women", the print-out insinuates. Hepburn continues to raise her niece alone, keeping secrets when the young girl begins to date Heflin's grown son and becomes involved in scandal brought out by his vindictive wife.Along the way, Hepburn meets the dashing Herbert Marshall who stands by her through thick and thin. Their first encounter is hysterically funny as the stubborn Hepburn finds herself an adversary in a non-moving mule. Who do you think will win this battle? Crisp disappears for much of the second half of the film, but when he returns for a conclusion to the shattered father/daughter relationship, it is heartfelt and emotional, helping you understand the hardness of the patriarch of an earlier generation who simply didn't know how to bring girls up alone in a masculine dominated era. 
tt0028517; When Victoria was queen of England ,a woman's place was nowhere,the first sequence is stunning :an old spinster ,under the father's (a judge)watchful eye, begins a long interminable tirade about woman's submission to man,they are considered inferior and their only ambition should be marriage and the joy to obey their husbands (the father intends to choose men with good prospects for his two daughters,he even goes as far as to say he did not love their late mom when they got married!A woman rebels:one of the girls wants a firm independence of men or at least she wants to marry someone she loves,the hints at "Romeo and Juliet" are not gratuitous:they were rebel lovers !The movie revolves around two main lines:-melodrama,with a predates such movies as "the old maid" and "to each his own",with all its implausibilities:the young Flora in love with the young Gerald!but it's the name of the game.-a pre woman's lib at a time one did not even think to hire a woman as a secretary,the heroine is not still a suffragette but when the movie is over,she is still relatively young and she will probably become one.My favorite scene is when Hepburn destroys the editorial dealing with sewing and proclaims her indignation after an unwed mother takes her own life .A beautiful portrayal of a modern woman (dig the last line,a compliment which could be returned to men too)masterfully played by the great Katharine Hepburn. 
tt1603807; Slice, came out here in Belgium very fast, even before it came out in the UK and US. We had that with other movies too so that's cool, isn't it? Let me say that again with Eastern flicks you have to understand their way of living. This is Thai and you know, or should know, that there are a lot of transsexuals living there. The sex industry lives on that kind of people as on other things, like pedophilia, we can't understand. The first part of the movie is gory and excellent filmed. But then the movie goes away from the blood and gore and turns into a movie about friendship. And it takes a real part of the flick, sometimes it get's a bit too much about the youth gang but it all has his purpose as you will see in the last quarter of the movie. And the last part is gory again. Some things I still doesn't understand like the red trunk but the movie works well. If you are into the brutal Eastern stuff, HK III, than this isn't a thing to watch but if you want a good storyline with a lot of blood, go watch it. 
tt1603807; This is the type of movie that is most difficult to give a full review and also cannot say why this movie is good or satisfying. It will become a spoiler for the smart audience. In fact, I find both reviews before me being a spoiler !!With so many Thai thrillers and horrors recently, I doubt there will be any more new ideas or surprises. I went to see this movie simply out of curiosity, to find out what is the "suprise" this time.Throughout most of the movie, although I find the camera work and colour scheme quite annoying, it's good enough to make me carry on without any other complains. When the movie come to the end, I am very SATISFIED. Sorry, I cannot use any other words to describe it or tell you why in order not to spoil your fun. Just watch it. You will not regret. 
tt1603807; The draw of this film personally is the involvement of Thai filmmaker Wisit Sasanatieng, who has of late been working on his Red Eagle film (am eagerly anticipating of course), but had managed to find time to pen down the story for Slice, a gory investigative thriller directed by Konkiat Komesiri who also wrote the screenplay from Wisit's story. From his past filmography in Muay Thai Chaiya and Art of the Devil 2, Konkiat successfully blends his experience from the two, and his Slice has clear influences from his horror and action background, more so the former when dealing with the gorier bits in the film.The film opens with a pedophile in a hotel room being given his retribution, where a figure cloaked in a red hood begins to systematically stab and eventually slice off the offender's genitals, before shoving it up the backside and having the mangled body disposed off into the river in a big red suitcase. This seems to be the modus operandi of the serial killer, and it baffles the police, led by corrupt cop Papa Chin (Chatchai Plengpanich). His only lead is Tai (Arak Amornsupasiri), serving time in jail and doing Chin's dirty work while inside, who has a 20 year old dream of the same situation of a cloaked figure and a red suitcase, and gets temporary reprieve by Chin to perform some investigations outside for 15 days, a deadline given by a Minister whose son had fallen victim to Mr Slice.The narrative though has surprisingly placed very little focus on the investigative drama it had set out to be. Instead, substantial time got devoted to the background and flashback to the past of the characters, dealing more with the friendship between Tai (the younger version played by Sikarin Polyong) and Nut (Artthapan Poolsawad), an outcast whom his peers deem fresh meat to be bullied, and encourages Tai to do the same. So on one hand, Tai can be Nut's best friend when they're alone, but when faced with peer pressure, do things that a true friend will possible not perform. And as if his life is already not miserable enough, Nut is also a sexually abused kid. So one can wonder what kind of effect such duality in friendship, and abuse would do to a person when growing up during the formative years.Like most Thai thrillers, this one comes with the token twist, though one should already see it coming with the numerous clues that Konkiat drops along the way, and adopts in certain terms like the Hong Kon thriller Confession of Pain, the identity of the killer is actually a non-issue and gets dealt with in a matter of fact manner. I will liken the style of the story to be much like the 20th Century Boys trilogy, where the young ones are given a lot more airtime, and the solution to today's problems as faced by the characters, can be found in their past childhood. You'll feel a little pang of pain especially when all anyone wants, is to be a friend of somebody since no man is an island, but it is this outreach of wanting to belong, when being abused, will bring about some heavy heart.The violence and gore here is graphic, bloody and brutal, though sometimes Konkiat had left things to the imagination to connect the final dots, with the mind after all being more sinister in conjuring up even more frightful imagery. Makeup is excellent, and in particular the part with a man struggling to hold up a terribly broken jaw. There are no good or bad characters here in the film as they all come with a shade of gray, and as mentioned while it offers little surprise, the revelation does leave one feeling a little icky, though the emotional resonance will likely ring through based on the usual horrific elements similar to how ghouls just refuse to leave their chosen someone alone. 
tt1603807; I don't understand how this film passed me without me knowing about it in 2009. I guess the first problem is that the film's title has been used in countless films and TV shows that it would be easy to miss. Nonetheless I finally discovered it and I am glad I did. This film is raw, intense, nefariously debauched and very tough to watch. Filmed beautifully and yet weird at the same time, Slice is a film that demands your attention no matter how squeamish you may be. I found the film very sad as well which I thought added a different dimension to the macabre at hand. One of the better Asian horror films of recent memory. Watch slice if you can handle it because there are images on screen that will carve you out indelibly. 
tt1603807; Thailand always likes to advertise itself like a country of 'great sexual freedom', an image that unfortunately many people buy. However, after having watched quite a big amount of their so-called 'films', I think that their mentality is in fact exactly the opposite, and that in this respect, they are no better than the West: I would even say that, by trying to imitate it, they're sometimes even worse: for what affects 'Slice, this 'film' is essentially disgusting, like the country it comes from: those Thais are so obsessed with homophobia, that they feel compelled to insert it in all of their so-called 'films': in this one, for instance, the director obviously films with great delight the homophobic scenes(mainly in the scenes when the main protagonist recalls his childhood) And in a countless number of their 'films', an observation I made after having seen many of them, they ALWAYS portray gays as ridiculous or degenerate beings. NEVER in a Thai film ('Bangkok Love Story' being the notable and UNIQUE exception)would you see a normal gay man.In 'Slice', this dirty mentality reaches a peak: although the director used a so-called 'gentle' and 'understanding' approach to show the extreme effects that strong abuse during childhood may produce, the FACT is that nevertheless, the gay character here is portrayed as a vicious and completely perverted serial killer who even turns out to be the main protagonist's 'girlfriend'!!! And , of course, he/she has to die in a completely over-sentimental and ridiculous final scene. So the cycle here is complete: they have come to the ultimate clichA©, which was in fact the real goal of the director: gay= vicious and perverted assassin. For what affects me, I am definitely done with Thailand, and my suggestion to them would be, the majority of their films being polluted with pervasive homophobia, just to stop making them: ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!!! 
tt0183808; The stranger Jack (Matthew Lillard) arrives in the studio of the crook collector of antiques Max (Vincent D'Onofrio) and tells his ambitious companion and specialist in poisons Jamie (Valeria Golino) that he is Jack's brother. Jamie does not buy his story, dominates Jack and ties him up to a chair. When Max arrives, Jack proposes US$ 100,000.00 for each one to protect him in a negotiation of the antiques "Spanish Judges" with a wealthy and dangerous collector. Max invites his stupid acquaintance Piece (Mark Boone Junior), who comes with his retarded girlfriend that believes she is from Mars, to compose the backup team. However, Jack double-crosses the collector and then he intrigues Jack, Jamie and Piece.The low budget "Spanish Judges" is a movie with a reasonable screenplay with an awful conclusion that wastes a good cast. Valeria Golino is astonishingly beautiful but together with the good actor Vincent D'Onofrio, they are not able to save the stupid story. Further, the scenes that are supposed to be funny unfortunately do not work, and actually they are silly and not funny. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): "Tudo Por Dinheiro" ("All For Money") 
tt0183808;  Wow, I can't believe i'm the first and only one to post a comment on this great movie.Although the movie itself seemed interesting enough the real thing that attracted me to this one is Matt lillard, granted most people probably either think he's too caffeine happy or just plain sucks but we're both the same age and from the same generation and i've watched this guy so many times that he's one of my favorites now.  This is one of the few movies where he is the big shot and main star kind of like in SLC Punk, another great Lillard film.Baiscally this is storywise your usual heist movies but with more twists than anything, which start to amount to craziness.  Also very notable in this movie is another great actor named vincent D'onofrio, a very under appreciated person in the film industry.  The woman in the movie is a newcomer and she isn't too bad although you know they hired her mainly for her accent and the nude scene  =)It's a game of jack vs jill vs bob as each want to reap the rewards but share with no one.  They all try to get eachother to kill off the other and it's a timebomb waiting to explode.  Matt shows his true prowess as the scheming JAck who initially starts the whole scheme.  Vincent and woman play a couple of art thieves who are in need of money due to a lack of business. Vince's character is a bit deranged and skitz's throughout the movie but that only add to the intensity of the film.The surprises left and right are well welcomed and the ending is very non cliche and makes you feel happy, well maybe that depends on the type of endings you like.  This movie kept me very interested besides the fact Matt was in it, it's a great movie and i'd highly recommend it to anyone who likes movies.  Critic's probably won't like this movie, but they don't watch movies cause they like movies anyway. 
tt0183808;  Two aspects of this movie had the chance to make it a good flick, the psychos in the gang, and the plot twists, mostly betrayals.  But it gets bogged down in a lot of banter, and the pace gets too slow, not as slow as "High Art", but close.  There is also a little too much over-acting, sort of like a high school play.  The beginning sets things up fairly well, and the ending has all the plot twists, but you have to bear with the middle scenes.  The psychos were well thought out, but not well executed, rather shallowly done.  Better caper/heist flicks to rent would be Phoenix, Route 9, or Judas Kiss, and a better psycho movie would be In Dreams, but it might be worth a couple bucks if you don't get your hopes up too high.   -Bob  
tt0183808;  Lillard's performance was similar to that in "The Curve". Which is also a really good movie if you like plot twists. D'Onofrio gave a perfect performance and Mars Girl is the cutest comic relief. Bottom line. I was very happy with the movie. I was excited up until the end when it took a very ...different turn, even then, I want to see it again. I am curious to see what extras, behind-the-scenes kinda stuff they have on the DVD. Anyways, 2 hours alone in the dark with Lillard and D'Onofrio is never a waste of time.  
tt0183808;  Although I did give this film a high rating, I was unsatisfied with the ending.Jack (Matthew Lillard) is a slick con artist who drops in on Max (Vincent D'Onofrio) and Jamie (Valerina Golino), two small time crooks and wannabe con artists.  You can tell pretty early on from quick flashbacks that most of what he says is a bunch of lies (don't worry, that's not a spoiler - they make that very clear in the first twenty minutes of the movie).  He needs their help to carry out an illegal transaction, something which they have never done before.  Max, a raging hot head, looks down his nose at Jack, but Jamie realizes that with their financial troubles, they don't have much of a choice.All three lead characters give terrific performances as low life criminals, and Lillard is better in this film than I have ever seen him before. Golino, who I am not familiar with, and the always excellent D'Onofrio are great as a paranoid couple.  The characters may seem too shallow for some, but they required a great deal of intensity that I doubt most A-list actors could muster, especially D'Onofrio's borderline-psychotic Max.Here are the spoilers.I enjoyed the movie, but I thought the ending was a bit unrealistic and predictable.  Not bad, mind you - it was ok.  But Jack just drops in as a mysterious lying stranger, and you can tell that he will most likely win in the end, you've never seen a film quite this odd before, and yet, it still seems cliche` somehow.  Jack was also a tad bit on the slimy, spineless side, and Jamie and Max's paranoia seems like it would have been assets to them rather than hindrances.  The fight scene at the end was also poorly choreographed and hard to swallow - Lillard simply can't look as mean and tough as D'Onofrio, not to mention that D'Onofrio's character was meaner as well.Aside from this, it is worth renting if you are into violent movies with plot twists. 
tt0183808;  I thought this movie did an excellent job of showing just how unpredictable love can be.  It was a tale of treachery and manipulation gone wrong and the consequences that must be paid.The plot kept one guessing what would happen next and was full of surprises. 
tt0183808;  Im a huge M Lillard fan that's why I ended up watching this movie. Honestly I doubt that if he wasn't in the movie i would of enjoyed it as much or even watched it but once I did watch it realize the story was pretty decent. A bad ending I must say but I did see it coming.  It's a low budget movie and some of the actors weren't really good but all in all I rated this movie 7/10.The suspense of wondering what Lillard was actually up to was what really keeped me interested in this movie.Its a good rental!7/10 
tt0183808; I really like Vincent Donofrio, but his movie choices are uniformly bad. The only decent things he's ever been in are Full Metal Jacket and Law And Order - Criminal Intent.This movie starts off slow and then slumps off from there. Ridiculous characters, implausible behavior, clichA©d performances, stupid story. It's all there, all the problems any film can have, all in one place. They should use this as a teaching tool in Film School: coursename = 'How Not To Make a Movie' , and a companion course: 'How To Ruin The Careers Of Actors Who May Actually Have Some Talent'.Don't waste your time, life is too short and each hour is precious... 
tt0183808; I must warn you, there are some spoilers in it. But to start it off, I got "Spanish Judges" on February I think. It was mention it was the last copy, but as I see, it wasn't back-ordered. But either way, I have it. I thought it was good. I wanted to see this mainly because of the great actor, Matthew Lillard (I'm surprised no one on the reviews mention the scar) although it is kind of low budget, getting enough money to make this film would be worth spending. Man, what a good actor.The story it about a con artist known as Jack (Matthew Lillard) who "claims" to have merchandises called The Spanish Judges. If you don't know what Spanish Judges are or haven't seen the trailer for this and this is the first review you have read, I won't even say what they are. I figure it would be a big twist of no one knew what it was. He needs protection, so he hires a couple who are also crooks, Max and Jamie (Vincent D'Onofrio and Valeria Golino) as well as a crook that goes by the name of Piece (Mark Boone Junior). He has a girlfriend who won't even tell anyone her name because she's from Mars, as she said. So they (mainly Jack) call her "Mars Girl". Everything starts out fine, but then it turns to one big game. A game that involves some lust, lies and betrayal.There was some over acting in it (Matt and Valeria, as well as Tamara, were not one of them). There were some scenes they could've done better and the score could've been a little better as well. Some of the score was actually good. The theme they used for the beginning and the end (before the credits) was a good song choice, that's my opinion. The fight scene in the end could've been a little longer and a little more violent, but what can you do? One more comment on Matt: Damn, he plays a smooth, slick con man.I know this is a review, but I need to make a correction towards NeCRo, one of the reviewers: Valeria Golino is not a newcomer. According to this site, she has been acting since 1983. To me, and hopefully to others, she is well known as Charlie Sheen's Italian love interest in both the "Hot Shots!" movies. But good review.Although I think it's one of the rare films I've seen and it's really good (which is why I gave it 10 stars above), I will give the grade of what I thought when I first saw it.8/10 
tt0183808; This is not a bad movie, but it sure doesn't greet the viewer in any expected way. You're not given any hit about who to like or who is the bad guy, so if you get stuck trying to figure that out it's going to make the movie less enjoyable. Although it's twisty plot makes you think that's what it's all about, you really have to approach it as a character-driven piece. Even the characters you end up disliking (I found Mars Girl annoying to no end) are played well, so you can't really fault the actors for how it doesn't all quite come together. I found myself *wanting* to like the movie more, but I felt a little too isolated as a viewer to care that much. 
tt0071880;  I finally had the privilege of seeing THE LAST 4 DAYS a few months ago, and I was blown away by how amazingly well done it was. The film stars the great Rod Steiger as Benito Mussolini, who faces his last 4 days of life. The film features great Ennio Morricone music, superb direction and great performances all-around by an allstar cast.Rod Steiger is INCREDIBLE as Mussolini. He faces his last days on earth having to make several major decisions as his life and nation fall apart around him. I can't describe his performance, it's just powerful and incredibly believable. Franco Nero is great, too, as an Italian partisan officer who is assigned to kill Mussolini. Lisa Gastoni is excellent as Mussolini's wife, who like any loyal wife, wants to be with her husband through the thick and thin. Henry Fonda is very good in a small role as Cardinal Schuster, who tries to help Mussolini but ultimately fails. Watch also for: Giuseppe Addobbati, Andrea Aureli, Bruno Corazzari, Marco Guglielmi, Tom Felleghy, Luciano Pigozzi, John Stacy and finally Giacomo Rossi-Stuart as an American officer assigned to apprehend Mussolini.The direction is tight and spectacular. Carlo Lizzani brings every aspect to the movie to life. The paranoia and confusion of Italy falling apart to stunning life. There is not a wasted frame in this movie, and the pace is set perfectly. The editing is also very good, -- especially in the scenes where Mussolini is jumping from flashback to current time -- are shocking realistic. Ennio Morricone's score is haunting and really penetrates you.I saw this movie as a copy of a copy of the Lightning Video. The print is relatively clear, especially for a 3rd generation copy, and I don't believe anything has been removed. If there is any missing footage, it doesn't show in the editing. The credits are letterboxed about 1.85:1. See an original video, don't be lazy like me and settle for somebody else's dub. The visual quality is essential to the theme of the movie.An amazing drama of a leader that not many people know much about. The film gives a true insight into the last days of his life, and we see him as more of a man than as a diabolical Fascist leader. For being so professional and stunning in every way, I give it a 10 out of 10.  
tt0071880;  Rod Steiger once again showed his ability to play roles of political and historical men. In the past he was Al Capone, Napoleon, Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, Pontius Pilate, and Mussolini twice (also in "Lion of the Desert" ,1980). At his last minutes he was a kind of Mussolini humble, lost, not knowing what to do once he was arrested. Very good acting also from Henry Fonda playing the role of Milanese Cardinal Schuster, he worries more about Mussolini's fate than of those innocents who may have died during those days. The film showed well how Germans wanted to keep Mussolini and the efforts of the Americans to capture him. The director Lizzani did an excellent work trying to show these last hours of the dictator and his lover, Claretta Petacci (Lisa Gastoni). Very interesting dialogues were shown between the guerrilla fighters and Mussolini. He claimed that only Germans guilty of the war, and that he had very little responsibility on what happened, but the fighters refused all his coward arguments with real facts. Mussolini destroyed Italian democracy, eliminated political parties and unions, and also killed many innocent people. He supported well Hitler although he was a puppet in the hands of the Germans. I do not know whether Mussolini was killed together with his lover in a way it is shown in the film. What is known is that he tried to cross the border disguised as a German soldier in a convoy of trucks retreating toward Innsbruck, Austria. He was recognized and together with Claretta shot in an area closed to Como. Until here the plot must be accepted, but I wonder why Lizzani did not want to show further this history, i.e. that the bodies were hung, head downward, in the Milanese Piazza Loreto in Milan. 
tt0071880;  The movie tells the story of "Il DuceÂ´s" or Benito MussoliniÂ´s last days. Abandoned by his black shirts and supporters, Mussolini is haunted by the Partisans, Allies, and even the Germans (who want bring him to Germany) Due to the great performance of Rod Steiger (Mussolini) and interesting plot + good music this is the best Italian movie I have seen.  
tt0071880; This is a great movie showing what a histrionic character and opportunist Mussolini was, double crossing until the end between the Italians, the Germans and the British, worried only about himself and not caring about the devastation he brought in his country and trying to escape to Switzerland where to live a comfortable life. Well depicted also his emotional life with her lover Petacci - which probably he exploited to the end for her devotion and total love. I was sorry that the story of the documents he was carrying with him, with all the letters exchanged with Churchill - and that would compromise Churchill if brought to the public - was totally ignored - probably too delicate a topic to be dealt with in this kind of commercial movies. 
tt0071880;  It is interesting that Rod Steiger has attempted two ambitious epic-roles in his career - Napoleon in Waterloo, and now Mussolini in Ultimo Atto - both European co-productions outside the normal auspices of Hollywood. Although it may be decidedly the minor of the two, the subject matter of the film still captivates the viewer as it chronicles the last few days of the Italian Leader.Mussolini: Ultimo Atto portrays the demise of Italy's one-time Dictator from a leader of emperor-like proportions to that of a desperate fugitive. Mussolini is hunted by four separate groups each with different ideas of his fate. Hitler wants him to fight until his final breath, the Allies and the new Italian government want him to stand trial for war crimes, and the Italian partisans want to shoot him on site.Rod Steiger plays Mussolini credibly (from what I know of him) and Henry Fonda is also notable in his role as a Cardinal. 
tt0071880; A very well made, personal epic about the last days of the Italian fascist dictator. Rod Steiger is very commanding in the title role, sweating out his final hours while he tries to outrun both the partisans and Allied troops, and getting little help from either the Germans or his hopelessly dedicated mistress Clara Petacci. Director Carlo Lizzani wastes little time and moves the film along at a brisk clip. The film has an epic feel to it while capturing the utter desperation Mussolini feels. Steiger is excellent and Lisa Gastoni is terrific as Pettaci. A number of Italian character actors, including Lino Capolicchio and Giacome Rossi Stuart appear in supporting roles. The film also features Franco Nero as as the dictator's soon to be executioner and, in a brief role as a duplicitous Cardinal, Henry Fonda. Another great music score by Ennio Morricone (one of his most despairing). 
tt0071880; The story of the last tragic days of Benito Mussolini is not well known, even by readers and students of history and specifically World War 2. The end for Il Duce came swift and dramatically. It was a fine line of circumstances that could have either seen him escape to Switzerland or return to Germany to join Adolf Hitler in his last days. The fact of what happened to Mussolini is sad, tragic, a terrible end for a man that was the galvanizing force for the rebirth and revitalization of a new and reformed Italy when Il Duce took power in 1922. For Adolf Hitler it was Mussolini who had always been a role model and an icon of the new philosophy of National Socialism. What happened to Benito Mussolini is a disgrace for such a great and visionary man that only wanted the best for the Italian people. Rod Steiger is superb as always as Il Duce. He reprized his role 6 years later in 'Lion of the Desert' 1980 when he played the visionary leader once more. Excellent film by Lizzani a master Director and sad to hear of his death just 3 months ago. Magnificent film. 
tt0071880; The film, like the almost contemporaneous Hitler: The Last 10 Days, follows the final hours of one of the leaders of the axis powers during WW2, in this case Benito Mussolini. Rod Steiger plays Il Duce (a role he was later to repeat in Lion of the Desert) and the bulk of the film concentrates on the former dictator coming to terms with the fact that his freedom is gone and his life may soon be as well. It is a compelling performance, as Mussolini begins defiant as the Germans demand to keep him under close guard (on the express orders of the FA1hrer), attempts to wheedle deals with the Church and the Swiss to ensure an escape to neutral territory then falls into a sullen sulk as he is made a prisoner of the Italian partisans, realising that he is probably going to be executed. By the time he is put up against a wall with a gun pointed in his direction, he is almost catatonic.This delineation of Mussolini's fall from power gives the film an authentically tragic aspect. It is as if the first 4 acts of Macbeth were cut and the final movement, with Birnam Woods closing in on the trapped usurper, were to constitute the entire drama. There is a wannabe Nietzschean aspect to Il Duce, a man who it is emphasised in the film looked on himself and was looked on by others as a God, although the slumped wreck we see being executed at the end is quite without divinity. The film strongly posits that Mussolini lost his self entirely when he lost power, an idea given vivid visual expression when he is wrapped in a head-bandage whilst being transported, the god-Emperor being reduced to the Invisible Man. The film portrays the dictator as a morally dubious but not utterly condemnable character Â<U+0096> although he sheds no tears nor has any feeling for the ruin he has brought on his nation, he is a man constantly let down by those he trust, whether it be his protA©gA© Hitler who invaded Russia against Benito's advice or his own black-shirts, who fail to provide the promised cavalry to rescue him.Two other important character studies are intriguing. Mussolini's mistress, Claretta Petacci, is portrayed as the ultimate in servile love, even sacrificing herself at the end in a vain attempt to save the man to whom she has uncritically (if jealously) devoted her life. In the final third of the film, the partisan leader Walter Audisio 'Valerio' becomes a focus of attention, driven onwards with a single-minded mission to ensure that Mussolini is executed in the name of the Italian people rather than becoming a trophy prisoner of either the Americans or the British. That Valerio is a rather inhuman, cold figure adds a certain odd ambiguity to the film, as only on an ideological level could we sympathise with this man against the Mussolini that we see through Steiger's performance. I am not sure whether to call this ambiguity daring or dangerous. The mistress and nemesis of the dictator are played respectively, and excellently, by Lisa Gastoni and Franco Nero. Henry Fonda has an intriguing cameo as a rather reptilian Cardinal, whose sympathies and opinions are impossible to gauge.The film begins at a stonking pace, cutting quickly through events and setting out the story admirably. The pace evens a little the tension mounts and the relationship between the dictators and his mistress gets explored with some depth and the negotiations as to what will happen to him get murkier.On the whole this is a rather remarkable film, deserving of being much better known. It is a decent history lesson but, far more, a brilliant character study and chilling portrait of what happens when a human being overreaches himself and is brought down to nothing and death. 
tt0071880; The story of the last four days in the life of Benito Mussolini during the close of the Second World War. Rod Stieger gives an often restrained performance as Il Duce. Henry Fonda is a Cardinal trying to bring an end to the madness of the war. Franco Nero is a partisan hunting the deposed leader. From what I could tell of the film from the print included in the BCI Maximum Action set this would be a good drama had I seen the complete film. I mention this because the print I say ran under 75 minutes while the running time at IMDb lists it as having two different versions running 105 or 120, meaning that I did not see 30 to 45 minutes of the film. The result of this choppiness is that a scene that is a meeting between Steiger and Fonda, who are the only two people in the room, suddenly are joined by 7 or 8 other people when they miraculously appear in seats around the table in the course of one shot to the next.Its a surreal moment. I liked what I saw, but There seemed to be so much cut out that I can't be sure that any problems I had was due to the film or the print. Worth trying for those interested in war time dramas assuming you can get a full version.(Rating of 7 out of 10 is based on the assumption that all problems I had with the film were do to a choppy print) 
tt0094959;  It must be like 5 years or so since I saw this movie and I think I will never be able to forget some of the scenes of this film . Its the story of a quiet young boy , going to school , having a quiet life , but lonely life because he have no friends and his mother is never there . His life begins to be more and more disturbed by the neighbourhood , and he'll slowly enter this violence , rubbing shoulders with a hoodlum and his gang. This movie is like CLOCKWORK ORANGE  without the science fiction , it is truly crude, the raping scenes really put uncomfortable .Brisseau could direct scenes as unforgettable as the Russian roulette scenes in DEER HUNTER , He's got the same dark , ultra realistic way of filming things that are beautiful or horrible . The actors are great , the story never slow neither exaggerates , is it one of my favorite French movies .And the end of this movie makes it a movie which may haunt you for many years .  
tt0094959; In Brisseau's precedent work "un jeu brutal" ,we made acquaintance with a scientist/serial killer and his disabled daughter ,who had no hope and were trying to nullify their life in the sound and the fury."De bruit et de fureur" is Loach 's "Kes" in the harsh realities of the late eighties.The hero,like Loach's is a young misfit ,whose only friend is a bird and whose mother is also absent (we never see her,we only read the notes she puts in the kitchen).And again,like in "Kes" a teacher tries to help him.The world around him is bleak,nightmarish and rough,epitomized by Cremer's -the serial killer in "un jeu brutal- character who turns his apartment into a shooting gallery.The ending might repel some .An intense poetry emanates from the last picture .Maybe up there someone likes him...maybe... 
tt0094959; The first time I saw this movie it was on TA©lA©-QuA©bec (Provincial owned TV station) a couple of year ago at 23h00 pm (it was the late night movie) and I was amazed by it! The story is so sad but real. The character are beautiful...And the end is a must see. If you know the BA©rurier Noir (A french punk-rock band) you should listen to Sur les toits and Vive le feu before watching this movie! It will put you in the right state of mind!!! After the presentation (with no ads!) I sat on my bed and said to myself: F*** how is it possible! How where they able to show this explicit hardcore, noir, avant-garde full reality movie on national television! (it was the first and only time I saw it as well, somebody probably got fired for that!) If only I had known back then I would have pressed record on my f***** VCR. Nowadays, there's no DVD version of it and to get it new on VHS it cost about 150 Euros!!! In short : It's a very well made no-budget movie that have inspired modern movie such as : Ma 6 - T va Crak-er and La haine Thanx RTB 
tt0094959;  It's been about 5 years since I saw this film, but it was so powerful that many images are still strong in my mind. Ostensibly based around a withdrawn, neglected young boy living with his mother (absent throughout the film) in a French sink estate, De Bruit et de Fureur soon departs from social realism to become something truly unique. It is, by turns, funny, grotesque, harsh and lyrical, and one of the most affecting pieces of cinema I have ever seen.  
tt0030150; Four brothers receive telegrams from their father, telling them he has been dishonourably discharged and bidding them meet him at their home. They arrive to learn that he has the evidence to prove he was framed in his court-martial, but before the end of the evening Father has been murdered in his locked study, and his papers stolen. The four brothers fan out across the globe in search of the four men their father mentioned who might be able to prove his innocence--sort of an inverted version of the Four Feathers.The brothers, played by George Sanders, David Niven, William Henry, and Richard Greene (who, from a distance, looks oddly like Brendan Fraser), are staunch in support of their dishonored father (played by the only actor who could command unquestioning faith in his military honor: C. Aubrey Smith). In their travels, they are haunted by Greene's irritating American girlfriend, played by Loretta Young as not much more than a series of costume changes (she shows up in some of the oddest hats imaginable, and one fur-trimmed number that makes you wonder if she's a Plushy fetishist--she does make up for it, however, in a lovely gown-to-watch-revolutions-by). Perhaps her most far-fetched moment, however, is her light-hearted banter after an evening of watching a military massacre.Along the way, the tone of the movie changes almost as often as Young's wardrobe. You think you're in a sort of amateur detective yarn, and suddenly you're watching innocent peasants mowed down by the military. The director, John Ford, is quoted in the AFI Catalog as having said, "I just didn't like the story, or anything about it, so it was a job of work." His lack of passion really shows.But the chaotic story (filled with pointless red herrings, such as the role Young's father may or may not have played in the evil-doings) does have some wonderful light moments, most of them provided by Niven, who is just delightful throughout: conversing with a boat steward in Donald Duck voices, playing with rubber toys, mocking Henry's incipient whiskers, roughhousing with his brothers when they reunite on a boat dock. These touches make the film less painful than it would be otherwise. The wonderful George Sanders, however, is painfully underutilized. 
tt0030150;  A lavish production, fast-paced direction, and some exciting action sequences tip the balance in favor of this basically juvenile derring-do in the spirit of GUNGA DIN. On the other hand, there is some offensive stereotyping, lots of flat dialogue, and cartoon-like conceptions of character. The four men are brothers, but act so naively that they seem like twelve-year olds: David Niven gets the brightest moments. While tracking down the enemies of their dear old Dad [the always magisterial C. Aubrey Smith], they are joined by spunky [verging on downright pushy] Loretta Young. She has one costume that can be described as the Grizzly Bear Dress, but she sports some nifty outfits too. They all rush around the globe chasing villains until Loretta's father, a kindly munitions tycoon, helps to resolve the mystery. A more accurate title might be FOUR FEATHERS MEET NANCY DREW.  
tt0030150; It will take FOUR MEN AND A PRAYER to save an old colonel's reputation from disgrace.Although its complicated plot is faintly ludicrous, this John Ford film offers plenty of action and some good acting to keep its viewers entertained. The production value is of a high order and there's a generous amount of heroics, which almost makes one forget that there's no really despicable villain to hiss.Barrister George Sanders, diplomat Richard Greene, military pilot David Niven, and Oxford student William Henry are the English brothers who unite to find their father's murderer and clear his good name. All do a fine job with what the script gives them, constantly dashing about and acting terribly energetic, with young Henry more than keeping up with his three better known costars. Greene actually has top billing, but Niven gets the best lines, getting to leaven a good deal of humor into his performance.Lovely Loretta Young does not fare so well. She's given the ridiculous role of a silly rich girl in love with Greene who follows him first from America to England, then on to Argentina and Egypt. Even witnessing a hideous massacre doesn't entirely sober her, as she begins to behave like a junior league Mata Hari to uncover information for the preternaturally patient Greene. One usually expects more than this from John Ford's heroines.The rest of the large cast offers able support, however. Wonderful old Sir C. Aubrey Smith graces his brief role as the men's tragic father. Stalwart Reginald Denny plays a captain with too much information for his own good. Affable Alan Hale has fun with his role as a millionaire arms dealer. J. Edward Bromberg is a squalid little South American general and, in a tiny role, John Carradine plays his suave & dangerous enemy. Blustery Berton Churchill plays the powerful tycoon father of Miss Young's character, while bantam Barry Fitzgerald steals his few moments of screen time as a boisterous little Irishman ready for a good fight. 
tt0030150; Richard Greene, David Niven, George Sanders and William Henry are the four men part of "Four Men and a Prayer," a 1938 John Ford film also starring Loretta Young. Frankly I felt as if I came in at the middle of this film, though I saw the whole thing - but I never actually did figure out the plot. The boys' father (C. Aubrey Smith) has been dishonorably discharged from the army and telegraphs each son that he wants to meet them at the family manse. The discharge was unfair - he was set up - now, I'm guessing here but it had something to do with illegal arms. His sons want to help him, but moments later, he is murdered in his study and his papers stolen. Taking what info they have, they split up and travel to India, South America and Egypt to find the people their father mentioned who can help clear his name. Loretta Young, who plays Greene's madcap girlfriend, chases him shamelessly in a variety of outfits.I still can't decide if there was too little or too much fooling around by the brothers. For me the comic stuff never does come off, Niven being the exception. The acting, however, is good. Richard Greene might have been Tyrone Power's only rival at 20th Century Fox, except that he returned to England in 1940 to enter the service. This was his first film under contract to Fox. He was very handsome with a nice screen persona, baby boomers may remember him as television's "Robin Hood." Loretta Young is dazzlingly beautiful - I actually didn't find her annoying as she seemed to fit right into the frenetic energy of the film. Sanders and Niven turned in their usual fine performances.There's a nice turn by Lina Basquette, too, as a foreign woman with information. For those who don't know Lina, well, she was a silent screen star and half-sister of dancer Marge Champion. She was married to Sam Warner, after his death, the Warners took her child from her and made sure she never worked again. She eventually went to the dogs - literally - by becoming a breeder and judge at the Westminster Dog Show. In a New Yorker Profile done in the 1990s, she claimed to have been propositioned by Hitler and said she had done work as a spy during World War II. She also declared Eric Braeden of "The Young and the Restless" her favorite actor and ended up meeting him. She appeared at Cinecom when she was in her late 80s, and the audience, used to seeing elderly actresses in wheelchairs, was shocked at the end of "The Younger Generation," one of her early films, when she didn't walk - but ran onto the stage, looking incredible, to answer questions.For me, Lina's appearance as Ahnee is actually the high point of "Four Men and a Prayer," featuring some very attractive people in a half-comedy/half-drama and a confusing plot. Thankfully, Ford didn't stick with this genre. 
tt0030150; Perhaps the inspiration for the 2005 film "Four Brothers," this overlooked John Ford gem from 1938 is a winner all the way, except for the nondescript title which makes one think this is going to be some type of religious outing, especially since Barry Fitzgerald is in the credits. Good performances abound, in particular Loretta Young as a headstrong globetrotter, Lynn Cherrington, who is determined to get her man but gets involved with murder and intrigue along the way, David Niven as one of the Brothers Leigh, Christopher, whose derring-do is often derring-undone, George Sanders playing against type as another of the Brothers Leigh, Wyatt, a barrister who knows the law better than he knows people, Reginald Denny as a gunrunner named Capt. Douglas Loveland who lets a pretty skirt get the best of him, Alan Hale as Mr. Furnoy, a scoundrel in sheep's clothing, and the always reliable C. Aubrey Smith in a brief appearance as the father, Col. Loring Leigh. Veteran actors Barry Fitzgerald and John Carradine do their usual superior jobs but have only small roles.John Ford's direction adds much to the total effect of the film. Note the action scenes in South American of the revolution where camera work and film editing are paramount. The firing squad sequence plays almost like a clip from Woody Allen's "Bananas," including several covert comedy touches that would later be labeled black humor.Not surprising for such a crisp script with probing lines, the hand of novelist William Faulkner shows through. This is obvious in the conversations between the brothers, at times playful, at other times dead serious, and in the repartee between Lynn Cherrington and the four brothers--also between her and her father.The story concerns Col. Leigh being accused of causing the death of several of his men in India. He is given a dishonorable discharge by the British army as a result. He summons his four sons to meet with him at their home in London. The youngest is enrolled at Oxford, the oldest is a practicing barrister, another is some sort of diplomat in Washington, D.C., and the fourth is in the military. The Col. has a briefcase full of papers to prove his innocence. While perusing the documents in the study to get his defense together while the four brothers are waiting in the foyer, a shot rings out. The Col. is dead but not from suicide as indicated by the position of the body and gun in hand. That the papers are missing points to murder.The four brothers then begin globe trotting to find the killer and the motive behind it. Two go to India to investigate. The other two go to South America. Geoffrey Leigh's American girlfriend, Lynn, tags along to help though her assistance is discouraged by the brothers. The plot becomes more complicated when it is learned that a gun syndicate called Atlas Arms may be behind it all. 
tt0030150; Four Men and a Prayer (1938) ** 1/2 (out of 4)John Ford directed mystery/comedy has an Army general discharged over false information and later the man turns up murdered. His four sons (played by David Niven, George Sanders, William Henry, Richard Greene) then show up on the scene to try and track down the truth. The story is certainly the weakest part here as it never really becomes too interesting and even at 85-minutes the thing starts to drag after a while. The four actors are very good in their roles especially Niven and top billed Loretta Young is wonderful but her character really wasn't needed in the story. John Carradine also adds nice support in his small role. The cast makes this worth watching at least once. It's also worth noting of some very graphic violence, which includes a bridge full of women and children being cut down by machine guns. There's also a rather amusing Asian stereotype that has him being called Donald Mouse because he speaks like Disney characters. 
tt0030150; A very serious plot is thwarted by comedy of all things. Four brothers try to clear the name of their good father who was dishonorably discharged for giving an order which was later found out to be forged by another person.In the midst of all this, the father who is murdered before he can reveal evidence attesting to his innocence, we have some comedy here. When the comedy fades, we have machine gunning killing of many innocent men, women and children in this very uneven plot. Who exactly are the rebels? What is going on here?Alan Hale is just too "light" to be the heavy in the film. Loretta Young, whose father in the film is the president of the gun business and who falls under suspicion, is flighty at best. She gets involved and her involvement gets the guys to suspect her. In the mean time, she loves one of the brothers played by Richard Greene. As the eldest brother, George Sanders is given little to do here and David Niven, another brother, is as stiff as ever. 
tt0030150; The basic story idea of FOUR MEN AND A PRAYER is excellent--that there is an international arms syndicate that instigates wars for profit. And, when a man (C. Aubrey Smith) gets in their way, they set him up and it's up to his four sons to clear their father's name. This first 15 minutes of the film really hooked me--what an exciting idea!!Unfortunately, I continued watching the film. What bothered me most were the rather annoying and insipid character played by Loretta Young as well as the often silly and unconvincing writing (especially the dialog). Instead of a serious drama, lots of bad and inappropriate humor was injected into the film (such as the god-awful voice that David Niven did twice in the film). Think about it...these four brave lads are out to prove dad was NOT a coward as well as discover who is a murderer and yet they take time to make jokes, engage in insipid "gay banter" and even chase a skirt (Miss Young)--all while they are on a desperate world-wide chase to uncover the conspiracy AND ensure world peace!! The bottom line is that the first portion of the film was excellent and it appeared as if the writer died and was replaced by a couple of 8 year-olds who love comedy AND movie serials!! A very poor mix indeed and a film that is only just watchable and everyone involved should have been ashamed of the final product--especially since the film features many excellent actors. Think about it--George Sanders, C. Aubrey Smith, David Niven and Alan Hale AND the film still is bad--that is TOUGH to do! Frankly, I think my 4 might just be a might generous. Watch only if you are a huge fan of John Ford and want to see one of his few misfires.While so far my review is the most negative about this film, I was shocked by one reviewer that gave it a 10! Even if I am off base, there is no way this film should be ranked up there with THE GODFATHER, GONE WITH THE WIND or MARTY. Even one reviewer, who liked it, described the film as "preposterous". 10?! A perfect film?! Certainly not! 
tt0030150;  This movie was a well written adventure and suspense yarn with a very distinguished cast. However, I feel that the character played by Loretta Young was overemphasized. From the moment that she first enters the story she is in virtually every scene. After awhile it got a bit distracting. She played one of those "won't take no for an answer" types who always gets her way. Despite this annoying characterization, overall i enjoyed the film. 
tt0030150; Interesting film for the actors playing three of the brothers and the father and Loretta Young in a more whimsical part than usual for her. We've seen this type character portrayed before - a charmed harum scarum type - but not particularly by her. It features Richard Greene, an actor whose star rose quickly but had a short run. Don't try to follow the action, and see it more than once if you intend to attempt to follow the path leading toward the perpetrator. The arms seller father is a rewarding figure as he turns out a good guy who helps to simplify things, much needed in a complicated and twisted trail. Alan Hale is also in an atypical role as the evil genius. I can see why this one would be diverting at the time of release, but not one with a lasting shelf life, except for completists of a particular actor or stalwart fan. 
tt0059290; Human Duplicators stars Richard Kiel as Dr. Kolos, an alien sent to prepare the Earth for invasion. His mission is to contact Prof. Vaughn Dornheimer, Earth's leading scientist in regards to cloning, and use Dornheimer to aid in creating a colony of clones (androids) on Earth.It doesn't take long for Kolos to locate Dornheimer and start producing clones. However, not everything goes as intended, and an investigation by an agency into investigating stolen parts and the death of a scientist related to Dornheimer's research. Also Dr. Dornheimer's lovely but pesky niece weighs more and more heavily on Kolos as the story develops.Now on to why I think many people enjoy this film. Personally I find it reminds me of the original Star Trek series. As fan a fan of Star Trek TOS, I'm not blind to stiff acting, mediocre sets, and goofy special effects. But it's part of the charm of Star Trek, these things are less important than the story telling and dreams that TOS represented. This film, although not related to Star Trek, manages to capture a bit of the same charm for the same reasons. 
tt0059290;  A movie where aliens try to take over the world.  Been there, seen that....Wait, this one stars "Jaws" from the James Bond films, Beaver Cleaver's dad and some actress who name is actually credited as "Bambi".Unique pedigree, at least.Okay, here's the situation: "The Human Duplicators" is a film where an alien (Kiel) must destroy humanity and replace them with extremely fragile androids so his people may conquer Earth.  If it were me, I would have just destroyed the world population outright but these guys look like they're waiting for some parts to come in.Naturally, it's up to stalwart citizens like Nader and Faith to save the day and the planet, with a hefty assist from Beaumont (I expected Barbara Billingsley to come around the corner any second and tell him, "Now just hang loose, blood....").  The whole thing is a product of the early to mid-'60s, sure enough, and is the perfect movie to watch if you want a good, wholesome night of derisive laughter at other peoples' expense.The movie ends on a semi-tragic note but you'll be crying already at the tragedy that you spent time out of your life to watch this mess.  That is, if you go in expecting greatness.Five stars for good intentions, plus one star more for seeing Kiel without the metal teeth for once.  Oh, the "Human"ity! 
tt0059290; How can anyone not love this movie it is so awful! The girl running around the house in chiffon, the alien who obviously never attended The Actor's Studio, the secret agent who keeps pronouncing the professor's (of course there has to be a professor, this is a science fiction movie)full name as if it were his LAST name, the nurses in white in the lab acting like nothing was out of the ordinary - and above all the lead is Ralph Nader, his girl Friday is Barbara Nichols, wisecracking her way through her scenes and the boss is good ole Hugh Beaumont of "Leave It To Beaver." (Maybe he needed some extra cash.)This even has a version on MST 3000, but can stand by itself. Everyone should have a copy. 
tt0059290; *Spoiler/plot- The Human Duplicators, 1965. An all-knowing outer space alien is dispatched from another galaxy to take over the Earth by "duplicating" humans. He wants to create a race of zombie people that really resemble animated pottery. The new formative "duplicates" are cooked up in the lab in individual coffins and things that look like Star Trek transporter pads. The alien master's heart is softened by the persevering kindness of a beautiful blind woman he meets. This deeply conflicts with his motives as the film plods to its "climactic" confrontation between the humans and their counterfeit duplicates.*Special Stars- Richard Kiel, Barbara Nichols, George Macready, Hugh Beaumnont.*Theme- Replacing the human race is impossible.*Trivia/location/goofs- Color. Film was shot in 14 days. Final film of Hugh Beaumont.*Emotion- A fun film to watch for it's cheesiness. Enjoy the opening and closing shots of the alien spacecraft resembling a Christmas tree ornament traveling through space. All of the faces of the "duplicated" humans shatter like 'a cheap vase when thrown to the floor'. The semi-robotic plot makes this film worth your time, if you like robots.*Based on- Outer space alien landing on Earth fears. 
tt0059290; I watched this film on the Mystery Science Theater 3000 format. It was quite funny. Well this is the plot. An emotionless alien comes down to Earth to do...I really don't know. It doesn't explain. Any way it is in a human robotic Terminator like form. Well it can make other forms of other people and when ever you shoot them they shatter like clay. Well there's this cop guy who investigates the whole thing while meeting with this professor and his blind daughter. While that is going on we see that the professor has been kidnapped, in his own home apparently and there is a clay terminator copy of him who is now running the show. Well there is eventually a giant fight to the death like there is in every other movie of this genre, and humanity wins. Well I haven't really been all that specific on this movie because there's nothing to be specific about. Well that and I saw it MST3K style. You don't get the plot of the original film on MST3K. You get humor. Therefore I suggest that you only watch the MST3K of this film. But if you are really curious than watch the original footage. 
tt0059290; Richard Kiel, best known as iron-toothed tall 'jaws' from James Bond 007, has a star turn as Dr. Kolos, an alien sent to earth to replace human beings with robots, the first targets scientists and military leaders that will be used to commit sabotage for the aliens to take control of the planet. It's fun to watch a transporter at work five years before Star Trek was ever filmed and to see Kiel romance his weakness (Dolores Faith) who persuades him to abandon his mission. George Nader (Not Ralph, like one reviewer said) plays the top agent assigned to investigate Kolo's diabolical scheme. Hugh Beaumont plays his boss in a rather humorous Leave it to Beaver style, and a character actress plays his whiny blonde gal friend, the voice familiar in dozens of films. But they don't subtract from the excitement generated by Kiel at the scientist's mansion. 
tt0059290; the human duplicators was one of those b-movies that is so bad its good, i remember watching it as Elvira's Mistress of the dark movie of the week.and later on mst2k.a n alien ship that looks like a swag lamp beams down an alien(Richard Kiel)that forces scientist(George mac ready) to duplicate people.then he falls for the scientists pretty blind niece. the budget is low but this is an entertaining move nevertheless.George Nader(not Ralph)plays a g-agent is sent by his boss(Hugh Beaumont of leave it to beaver)to investigate the goings on.androids go amok. I'm giving this little screen gem 5 out of 10.kudos to Elvira for showing this on her program.Trekkie's take note Kiel beams down from his ship to earth,sound familiar??? 
tt0059290;  Hugo Grimaldi's directorial work will not win him any awards from mainstream Hollywood, but he has made his niche on the world of B-Movies.This effort was a step up in some ways from his classic, "The Phantom Planet", where he teamed up with production designer and associate producer Robert Kinoshita (the designer of "Forbidden Planet"'s Robbie the Robot and the B9 bot from "Lost In Space"). For openers, this movie was filmed in color, a small process that could have perhaps helped lift "Phantom Planet" out of it's near obscurity today.However, for all his efforts, "The Human Duplicators" was saddled with the same problems that sank it's predecessor: poor scripting, cheap sets and effects, borrowed soundtrack music and audio effects, even using "Phantom Planet" veteran bad guy, Richard Kiel (Jaws of "Moonraker" and "The Spy Who Loved Me")as an android with a heart, as well as other questionable casting, such as Hugh Beaumont ("Leave It To Beaver"), which hindered the credibility of the characters, ergo so went the plot and any chance of suspense (This debate still rages when you ask the question "What if Hitchcock knew that Ted Knight would be forever associated with the egotistical, clueless TV anchorman Ted Baxter? Would he have removed him from the closing scenes of "Psycho"?). 
tt0059290; Even though The Human Duplicators isn't a very good movie (it registers far too high on the boredom scale) there's something oddly entertaining about the whole thing that keep me from rating it a bomb as so many others. It's a crazy mix of 60s sci-fi and spy movies. The plot involves an alien named Kolos (Richard Kiel) who comes to earth to prepare the planet for a takeover. His plan involves kidnapping the Earth's most learned scientists and replacing them with duplicates under his control. Agent Glenn Martin (George Nader) is sent in to investigate the disappearance of the scientists and get to the bottom of things. Complicating matters is a blind girl (Dolores Faith) who Kolos finds himself strangely attracted to. Like I said, The Human Duplicators is not a good movie. It's actually quite bad. In all reality, the 2.3 IMDb rating is probably much more accurate than the 4/10 I've rated it. But I was entertained despite the movie's many problems. It might have been a case of "so bad it's good" (God, do I hate that expression). A secret agent with a blond floozy of an assistant, a giant alien in love with a petite blind girl, human replicants that shatter like terra cotta, a Medieval looking dungeon in Southern California, a roadside motel that doubles for a secret military establishment Â<U+0096> it's all so bizarre! 
tt0059290; When a film's best special effect is the casting of a 7 foot tall giant (with a thick, inexpressive voice) as the main villain, the film is in trouble. And when the film's best actor is Hugh Beaumont, and it wastes him in a small supporting role, it has no choice but a destiny for eternal "B" movie status. Still "Human Duplicators" isn't really a "bad" movie. It's just kind of under-powered and under-budgeted. And compared to toxic wastes of film like "Pod People", "Beast Of Yucca Flats" or "Cave Dwellers", "Human Duplicators" is like spending an afternoon at the Louvre. It's typical of many of the movies that "Mystery Science Theater 3000" riffed on in Season 5 and 6 - mediocre, cheesy, 2nd rate, but presentable and at least mildly entertaining.Give the film creators credit for trying to put a novel spin on the old "Invasion Of The Body Snatchers"/"Colossus" themes by incorporating Cold War paranoia with the concept of a 'fifth column' of android impersonators. They took Kiel's stiff, inexpressive persona and tried to work with it by framing him as an cold, impassive alien and having all the actors playing the "android replacements" act the same way. (It's high school level theater technique of course, but at least it's a deliberate choice). They set most of the proceedings in and on the grounds of an elaborate old mansion (complete with secret passage and a dungeon) and loaded the sets with all the elaborate bric-a-brac, flocked wallpaper and ornate furniture they could stuff in it to keep the settings visually interesting. They tried to work in some 007 style suaveness and romance with a smug,smarmy hero (who actually seems to have some brains) and his Girl Friday type. There's even a fairly hot "blind" brunette running around the mansion and she's pleasant to look at (once you get past her clown outfits). The trouble is, of course, that none of this is enough. You can't pull off romantic scenes and witty war-between-the-sexes by-play when the Girl Friday has a nasal Jersey voice that hits the viewer like nails on a chalkboard. Kiel tries hard, but he doesn't have any charisma to back up his startling size and his lines sound like they've been wrung out of a wash cloth. The way the scenes are shot inside the mansion are dull and interesting - as Joel remarks in the MST coverage, "it's like a slow motion British bedroom farce" only without the humor, or the sex, or the comic timing. Most of the special effects are silly and unconvincing , especially in the "climactic" battle at the end of the movie where Kiel does battle with a bunch of android duplicates while the hero shines a "pulse lah-zer" on them to screw up their mechanical brains. The deus-ex-machina, er, sorry, "pulse lah-zer" looks like a Klieg light on wheels...you can tell that they just didn't have room in the budget or time in the schedule to make something credible looking or stage its use in a compelling way. Still, it's more professional looking and less cheesy than anything from the Corman factory or from Ed Wood, Larry Buchanan or Herschel Gordon Lewis. You could put this on during a 'science fiction' themed evening of movie watching and get a nostalgic chuckle out of it before you went on to the "hard stuff" with Boris Karloff and Lon Chaney. In spite of my complaints, no one involved with "Human Duplicators" has anything to be overly ashamed of. (As far as I know!) 4 stars out of 10 
tt0041530; Continuing where 'The Jolson Story' left off, this sequel explores a less exciting part of Al Jolson's life, however it is saved from dullness by a great gimmick in the final 25 minutes: depicting the making of 'The Jolson Story', which includes Jolson meeting Larry Parks. It is certainly inferior to the first film, but yet still entertaining whenever Parks performs one of Jolson's tunesÂ the songs are still great. Although he does not look or sound old enough, Parks still gives it his best too. The film definitely resurrects good memories of the original, without a strong yearning to see something better, which is a good thing. The characters, the acting, the originality, in fact, just about everything was better in 'The Jolson Story', however, even if not quite as involving or as well made, this still passes the test for an adequately amusing piece. 
tt0041530;  The sequel to The Jolson Story with Larry Parks playing himself and meeting Al Jolson for the first time to do this film.  Jolson also appears in a long shot of a ramp scene singing Swanee River, but most people didn't know this until years later.  The story begins with a Hollywood producer wanting to do the story, and takes up where Jolson's first wife gets a divorce.  The movie of his life is a big winner! Later, during WW II, Jolson goes overseas to entertain troops, catches malaria, and while in a hospital falls in love with his nurse, a kind and patient beautiful nurse, played by Barbara Hale.  William Demarest plays Jolson's manager and press agent.  Ludwig Donath plays cantor again, and momma is played by Tamara Shayne, who lend much humor to the story.  Perfect for those who loved Jolson and his music!  This production won 3 Oscar nominations for writing, cinematography and musical scoring.  I give it 10/10 
tt0041530; JOLSON SINGS AGAIN (Columbia, 1949), directed by Henry Levin, is a sequel to the highly successful THE JOLSON STORY (1946), which focuses on the life and times of legendary entertainer, Al Jolson (Larry Parks), continuing where the previous film left off, singing to his heart's content to a night club audience as his wife, Julie (Evelyn Keyes, in a role based on Ruby Keeler), finding that her husband is much happier singing to his audience than being in retirement with her, is seen walking out of the club and his life forever. With the film released three years later, one would have to assume that it had taken Al Jolson nearly three years to finally stop singing and get down to reality that his wife is out of the picture and not ever coming back.In the opening of this sequel, Jolson (Parks) returns home to find Julie has packed up her bags and is gone for good. He searches for her, only to find that she has divorced him. With the advent of World War II, Jolson returns to show business by entertaining the troops overseas. During this time he finds sadness with the death of first his mother (Tamara Shayne), and later his father (Ludwig Donath). Jolson continues to be a trooper and perform whenever and wherever he's needed, but due to overwork and little rest, he collapses during a performance. He is later nursed back to health by Ellen Clark (played by Barbara Hale, based on Jolson's fourth wife, Erle Galbraith, an X-ray technician), whom he soon marries. In spite of his great showmanship, Jolson faces a setback in his career, receiving no offers and finding himself passed over by a newer generation of singers, like Bing Crosby or Frank Sinatra. When Jolson gets a chance to appear in an all-star benefit, his name is not among the many stars listed in the program, thus coming in last to sing one song to a half empty theater. Jolson's song captures the attention of Colonel Ralph Bryant (Myron McCormick), an avid fan who had previously met Jolson during his war tour. Now a movie producer, he stumbles upon an idea in producing a motion picture based on the life of the great Jolson, a big gamble that would soon pay off.A half hour shorter than its predecessor, JOLSON SINGS AGAIN, at 96 minutes, fails to disappoint when it comes to bringing back many of the old Jolson songs, as before, sung by the real Jolson but lip-sync by Larry Parks. The soundtrack is as follows: "Rockabye Your Baby With a Dixie Melody," "Is It True What They Say About Dixie?" "For Me and My Gal," "Kol Nidre" (traditional Jewish prayer), "Back in Your Own Back Yard," "I'm Looking Over a Four-Leaf Clover," "When the Red-Red Robin Comes Bob-Bob Bobbin' Along," "Give My Regards to Broadway," "Chinatown My Chinatown," "I'm Just Wild About Harry," "Baby Face," "After You've Gone," "I Only Have Eyes For You," "Sonny Boy," "Toot-Toot Tootsie, Goodbye," "California, Here I Come," "California, Here I Come" (reprise), "You Made Me Love You," "Let Me Sing and I'm Happy," "My Blushin' Rosie," "Mammy," "The Spaniard Who Blighted My Life," "California, Here I Come" (reprise), "About a Quarter to Nine," "The Anniversary Song," "Waiting for the Robert E. Lee," "April Showers," "Pretty Baby," "Carolina in the Morning," and "Rockabye Your Baby With a Dixie Nelody" (reprise, finale). As many songs heard in this and the previous Jolson story, it is evident there are more songs to go around that never made it to the final print.Other than William Demarest and Bill Goodwin reprising their roles as Steve Martin and Tom Baron, the supporting players include: Robert Emmett Keane, Eric Wilton, Martin Garralaga and Larry Parks. Yes, Larry Parks! Parks is the star in this production playing Al Jolson, but he also appears as himself during the Hollywood sequence where Jolson meets Larry Parks prior to the production of THE JOLSON STORY. Barbara Hale as Jolson's new and younger wife, is extremely likable. Unlike the Julie character, Hale's Ellen doesn't have a hold on her husband and agrees to let him do what he is put on Earth to do, and is to live up to his reputation as "the world's greatest entertainer."While some may argue that JOLSON SINGS AGAIN to be an unnecessary sequel, but in fact, is a worthy follow-up. Since the earlier film found Jolson's wife leaving him during a performance, the question remains as to what becomes of Jolson afterwards. JOLSON SINGS AGAIN explains it, tracing his up and down career during the war years of the 1940s, and centers on a harsh reality as to how even the most popular of entertainers can no longer be wanted and soon forgotten by the industry. Jolson happened to be one of the fortunate ones to have achieved his greatest comeback. While many bio-pics of the day focus on the subject matter already deceased, the Jolson movies are rare cases where the central character is very much living. The real Jolson died in 1950, so chances for a third Jolson story was unlikely. As for Larry Parks, the other films in which he starred had failed to become as memorable as his two Jolsons. His career suffered a setback during the early 1950s during the McCarthy-ism era.THE JOLSON STORY and JOLSON SINGS AGAIN make worthy double bills whenever shown on Turner Classic Movies (TCM premiere: December 13, 2007). While both films have turned up on both home video and DVD, it's JOLSON SINGS AGAIN that has lacked frequent television exposure in recent years. As sequels go, JOLSON SINGS AGAIN is as good as it gets. And with Technicolor, it's an added plus. (***1/2) 
tt0041530;  As a rule, sequels don't usually measure up to the original. Of course there are exceptions and this is one of them. Once again, Larry Parks does an amazing job of mouthing the words to Jolson's singing voice and sings a number of great standards. This time the plot focuses on Jolson's disillusionment with show business after his wife leaves him. Prompted by his agent (William Demarest), he agrees to be an entertainer during World War II and on one of his tours he meets a pretty nurse (Barbara Hale) whom he marries. High quality script has Jolson coming to Hollywood for a bio on his life and meeting Larry Parks (courtesy of trick photography). Song-filled gem is a worthy sequel and proved it by winning three Oscar nominations for writing, cinematography and musical scoring. Hale looks great and her pleasant personality adds sparkle to the film, while Parks is once again quite convincing in his colorful role. 
tt0041530; This film is unique, as a sequel to the original "biographical" picture three years earlier. Actually, placed in tandem with "The Jolson Story," it begins precisely where the original ends. Together, they present one unified story (as fictionalized as it is) of Jolson from his mid-teens to the period of his rejuvenated career (even besting Crosby and Sinatra as the country's top male vocalist) - when he is now in his 60's, not long before his career was ended by a fatal heart attack, at age 64 (some sources indicate 65). If viewed together, "Jolson Sings Again" comprises with the predecessor a seamless 3-hour 44-minute presentation of this great entertainer's work. As with the original, much is pure fiction in the way it portrays Jolson's persona. This is even affirmed to a degree when Parks indicates to the screen writing team, after it is arranged in this picture to film "The Jolson Story," that they can juggle dates and facts as they like. He indicates his desire simply to show the performer who loved to entertain. A good friend of mine, who is an entertainer, a member of "The Jolson Society," and who has known some who themselves knew Jolson personally - as well as other things I've heard and read - indicated specific variances to this story. Jolson apparently, instead of agreeing reluctantly to have his life story filmed, vigorously pursued this end. He also, with equal vigor, argued that he play himself, and purportedly did not have quite as "warm and fuzzy" relationship with Larry Parks as shown. It is also unbelievable, even "corny," how this man could be as amazed, even confused, by some of the events in the film. He had been singing during his entire life, starred in the first "talking" picture, appeared in several films, and made numerous records - from their earlier times. He was one of the pioneers through numerous innovations over many years years, in both film and records. Yet in the story, he is portrayed as naive, and totally surprised, to see the recording facilities the movie producer has. He exhibits an almost child-like amazement upon being shown the film clip of Parks' miming in-costume his recording of "Toot Toot, Tootsie" -- which the producer and Al's wife had "prodded" him into making. Although still interesting to view in the film, this is the most far-fetched of fiction. One area of the story completely in harmony with real life, though, was depiction of his various tours entertaining armed service personnel. Jolson was admirably every bit as dedicated towards entertaining our military, as shown (actually, perhaps even more so!) - and did so during several conflicts, from the Spanish American to Korean Wars (visiting troops of the latter at his own expense) . The portrayal of his continuing relationship with William Demarest's "Steve Martin" composite/fictional character, and Barbara Hale as his wife (2nd in this story, 4th in real-life) are warm and enjoyable to observe (Demarest's "Steve" is the spriest senior citizen ever, on film or off -- based on the overall time line of the two pictures, he would have been well into his 80's). And like the original, the music in this sequel is outstanding, the performances well-acted, 
tt0041530; Wonderful sequel to the 1946 film. Larry Parks, William Demarest and several others repeated their parts from the original.The film picks up exactly where the original had ended. Disgusted with his life, Jolson (Parks) walks out on his show business career and for several years travels, dabbles with horses and lives a real care-free life.With the death of his mother, (Tamara Shayne-who really doesn't look or act too Jewish at all), Jolson embarks on a tour for services until illness ends that.There is a nice performance by Barbara Hale (the future Della Street) as the southern nurse that he marries. Hale has just the right Arkansas twang in her speech to carry it off.When illness follows him, Jolson withdraws from entertaining fearing that his lung operation has affected his voice. He also feels that no one is really interested in him anymore. Unfortunately, the latter is true.It is only when his life story is made into a motion picture that he makes a genuine come back.Parks is absolutely amazing as Jolson. Though Al sang, Parks does a brilliant job of dubbing. His mannerisms are so easily identified as those of Al Jolson.Ludwig Donath plays Jolson's cantor father. O my, a cantor eating in a non-kosher restaurant. What were the Hollywood writers thinking?Just hearing Jolson belt out his usual great tunes is great in itself. Entertaining and wonderful to view. 
tt0041530; This takes the Jolson story that stage further, it shows him slide into a rut of self pity, then when realising he has something to live for he fights back in his own way.Jolson was one of the first entertainers to travel and give troops a show.The energy of the man comes through , he was no saint and i bet at times he was very difficult but the talent shines through.The film fetches back a lot of characters from the first movie, and lets be honest if your a fan you will love this.Barbara Hale is excellent as the love interest and its an inspiring movie all round.There's a clever sequence when filming the Jolson story which has Larry Parks as himself and the star.Watch and enjoy.I also hope a new film about Jolson will be made in the near future. 
tt0041530; This is the follow-up movie to The Jolson Story. It brings Al Jolson back into the public eye again. The movie may not be the true story of Al Jolson's life, but it is so enjoyable that you will forget this once Jolson starts to sing. Larry Parks is very believable as the great singer and the moment where Jolson meets Larry Parks in the movie, is special. Larry does a wonderful job and he really does seem to sing himself, he certainly does not appear to be just miming the words. Ludwig Donath as his father and William Demarest as his manager and Barbara Hale as his wife, all combine to support Larry Parks in this very enjoyable musical of a great singer. 
tt0041530; Jolson Sings Again was a film that was almost demanded to be made by the general public. The Jolson Story had generated a comeback for Al Jolson and he was in the word of one of his hit songs, 'sitting on top of the world' in 1949.He was going on all cylinders in 1949. Jolie hadn't commercially recorded since 1932. He had done a record of Swanee and April Showers in 1945 that went nowhere. But with the success of The Jolson Story, Decca signed him to a long term deal and he was prolifically recording all his old songs and new contemporary material besides. You should hear his Some Enchanted Evening from South Pacific, but not in Jolson Sings Again unfortunately. Jolson had also replaced Bing Crosby after a couple of interim hosts as star of radio's Kraft Music Hall as Crosby changed sponsors first from Philco Radio to Chesterfield. They guested on each other's programs and those shows are priceless. In fact Bing is mentioned in Jolson Sings Again, but Harry Cohn couldn't get Paramount to part with him for an appearance.Larry Parks continues his lipsynching to over a dozen Jolson standards and returning from the first film with him are William Demarest, Bill Goodwin, Ludwig Donath, and Tamara Shayne. And this one in bringing Jolson's life up to date stuck closer to the facts than The Jolson Story.Barbara Hale plays Jolson's fourth wife Erle Galbraith renamed Ellen Clark for the film. I guess Harry Cohn figured he had to since he'd renamed Ruby Keeler, Julie Benson in the first film. It is true she was an army nurse and she met Jolie as a patient there when he collapsed on a USO tour during World War II.If you liked the first film and Al Jolson in general, no reason you won't like this one. 
tt0041530; Can a sequel be as good as the original? Those who say no, think of "Godfather II." Of course "The Jolson Story" takes us from the time of his blossoming adolescence to the end of marriage number one, with Ruby Keeler played by Evelyn Keyes. This sequel is totally absorbing because it's rapid fire pace, great music, great acting and warmth combined with the fascinating story of how "The Jolson Story" came to be.By the time of Pearl Harbor, Jolie's career had taken a nose dive.That is until he got off his rump and hesitatingly decided to TRY to entertain the boys overseas. Incidentally, Al was one of the first celebs to do it but of course will always be overshadowed by Bob Hope and his troupe.While in the Aleutians, Al meets Officer Ralph Bryant played by Myron McCormick.Bryant was in the cinema profession before joining up and after the war ends, is the one who talks to a depressed Al, sent home twice for illness,about an idea. To take Al into a recording studio to knock out technologically enhanced versions of his great tunes which will be lipsynched by a young actor named Larry Parks. Al begrudgingly decides to opt for it and that's where "liftoff" takes place.Al is on a rocket ride which opens his career all over again. From the time of "Jolson Story" to Oct.1950 marking his death, he had his own radio program, "Kraft Music Hall" plus a zillion guests spots up and down that radio dial.The picture is phenomenal as a sequel which I found as entertaining as the original. By the way, it also was nominated for Oscars as was the original. It is a KNOCKOUT film and I highly recommend either renting it or waiting for it on TCM. 
tt0418096; Bipasha Basu is caked with so much makeup t'would make Barbie squirm. Oof. Her acting talents leave a lot to be desired, her Hindustani diction sucks and frankly I do not see her going places in films, at least films with any substance. Sanjay Dutt gives another wooden performance and Suniel Shetty bores with his mentally handicapped style and dialogue deliverance. Moraes does come across as a viable villain and is the most believable in this rather predictable and flat film on communication from the beyond. The most annoying feature of the DVD was the sound that jumped into deafening sound effects and then dropped to very low on dialogue. A horror film it is not. The only thing that made me jump was the sound effects which are jarring. 
tt0418096; Saw this movie starring some of my favorite stars: Bips, Sanjay Dutt & Suneil Shetty.Medium: VHS @ Home Noticeable: Perfect remake of English movie "Gift".Wonderful depiction and performance from Bips. The others were fairly standard in their character portrayal. Catchy locales and opening! The suspense was very nicely built up for a Bollywood movie.There could have been some better songs and some good sequences but I think the producers decided to keep it a faithful remake of the Gift. The name, Dhristi was awesome!What's new: Pretty much nothing! Overall: Great Thriller! Good climax. 
tt0418096; The first thing that I am willing to say is that I wish I were the director of this movie. Good direction can convert an average script into an admirable movie and poor direction can spoil even the greatest script. And that's what exactly happened to this flick produced by the liquor-cum-aviation baron, Vijay Mallya, whose plot has been lifted straightaway from a Hollywood movie - The Gift (2000).There is an ancient Indian maxim - JISKA KAAM USI KO SAAJE, AUR KARRE TO PAAGAL BAAJE (one should do that job only which suits him or in which he is skilled, if he does someone else' job, he will be considered mad because he will fail miserably at that). And that's what I am willing to convey to Mahesh Manjrekar, the director of hard-hitting, realistic and touching movies like - Vaastav, Tera Mera Saath Rahe, Nidaan, Ehsaas, City of Gold etc. Making a good suspense-thriller is not anybody's cup of tea. There was a time in Bollywood when brilliant suspense-thriller specialists like Raj Khosla, Raja Nawathe, Shankar Mukherjee, Biren Nag, Raghunath Jhalani and even B.R. Chopra were active in the field who gave us memorable suspense-thrillers like Humraaz, Mera Saaya, Woh Kaun Thi, Gumnaam, Mahal, Kohra, Anamika, Uljhan, Kanoon, Dhund etc. Now there are no such directors with the exception of Abbas-Mustan. Mahesh Manjrekar made an attempt to do their job, falling flat on his face. He could not just handle the brilliant script stolen from The Gift in his inexperienced hands (for this type of movie). Had Raj Khosla made this movie during the sixties or the seventies, it could have been a classic.It's a murder-mystery with insertion of supernatural element through the God-given capability of the main protagonist (Bipasha Basu) to foresee future events. She is a single mother (widow) of an eight years old son, other than being a tarot card reader and an astrologer by her profession. The mystery is of the murder of Amrita Arora who first goes missing and then is found murdered with her dead body lying in a lake. There are many characters associated with the life of the central character of the movie, i.e., Bipasha, viz. Sanjay Dutt who is the principal of her son's school, Payal Rohatgi who is her friend, Neha Dhupia who is her another friend, Dino Morea who is a rowdy and Neha's wife-beater husband, Sunil Shetty who is a crazy motor-mechanic and considers Bipasha as his good friend, Shashikala who is her granny and whose spirit comes to bless her after death (Bipasha doesn't know by that time that her granny is no more), Himanshu Mallik who was Amrita's secret lover, Abhishek Bachchan who is her ex-beau etc. Finally the face of the murderer is revealed, bringing an end to the suspense after many scenes which involve the police activity and the court-room arguments of the lawyers involved too.The treatment of this excellent plot is not at all coherent and impressive and the only face-saving grace is the outstanding performance of Bipasha alongwith some really good scenes (the best one, in my opinion, is the scene in which the spirit of Bipasha's granny, Shashikala gets evaporated into the air in front of her eyes). Due to poor direction, the movie which could have become an excellent one on overall basis, has been reduced to an assembly of some good and some bad scenes. It was promoted as a spine-chilling thriller but there is neither any chill for the viewer's spine, nor any good suspense (most of the viewers can guess the real murderer with relative ease), nor any momentum to keep the viewer continuously on the edge of his seat. The script of a good suspense-thriller should be well-knit and all the incidents being shown on the screen should have a logical association among them whereas the narrative of Rakht seems to be scattering here and there amidst the scenes which have not been sensibly linked and kept in proper sequence.Anand Raj Anand's music is passable. Two songs are good though. However these songs as well as the flash-back entry of Abhishek Bachchan only block the flow of the narrative. Had I directed this movie, either I would have made it sans any songs or would have made the music team prepare at least one good mystery song (in terms of words and composition) deepening the mist in the story.I am a die-hard fan of Bipasha Basu and hence my opinion towards her performance may be biased. Still the viewers will agree that she is the pivotal character of the story around whom the other ones move in a circle. And it's her only who keeps the viewer's interest alive in the movie. Though performers like Sunil Shetty, Dino Morea, Sanjay Dutt, Neha Dhupia etc. have tried their best to do justice to their assigned roles, the problem is that their characters have not been properly developed in the movie. They are sketchy and therefore, fail to leave a mark.Cinematography and technical aspects of the movie are more or less OK. Background score is also OK though I have already mentioned that the movie fails to scare despite the tall claims of its makers. Besides, it's not a horror movie, it's a suspense movie.Still, I recommend this movie to the fans of Bipasha Basu as well as those who like mysteries very much because though it's not well made, the story is pretty good. The mystery-fans who have not watched the Hollywood movie - The Gift, may like it as a one time watch. My overall rating for the movie is 2.5 stars. It could have become a movie worth the rating of 4 or 5 stars, had it been directed by Jitendra Mathur instead of Mahesh Manjrekar. 
tt0418096;  God only knows why a director such as Mahesh Manjrekar would make such a movie. It starts of slightly original and ends up being a direct "rip off" of "The Gift", which stars Keanu Reeves and Cate Blanchett, lifted scene-for-scene.Mahesh is usually a great director doing original material, and this movie makes you wonder why he has gone down this route. Bollywood needs to steer clear of doing direct rip-off movies, such as Hum Kaun Hai (2004) which is "The Others" with Nicole Kidman. If they do copy the idea, they should significantly change it.If you have seen "The Gift", a great movie by Sam Raimi, steer clear of this one, but if you haven't, you may like it. If you do watch it, it'll be for Bipasha Basu (wow) who is always a pleasure to watch, for her beauty and her acting. There's and a good performance from Sunil Shetty (not playing the tough guy for once).Sadly, 3/10  
tt0418096; Mahesh Manjerekar has made several films like VAASTAV, ASTITVA after which his films failed to click at the BO yet many got critical acclaim RAKHT made him try horror for the first time and he signed his fav Sanjay Dutt, Suneil Shetty alongwith Dino, Himanshu.etc He cast Bipasha in the main role The film is inspired from THE GIFT however it also is similar to 100 Days(1991) a Hindi film which itself was remade from some Hollywood film. The film however could've been interesting fails overall. The start of the film is good, slowly Mahesh introduces half a dozen subplots and all seems well. They are some interesting characters like Dino, Suneil Shetty. even Amrita Arora's character keeps you guessing. One joke is that in the film Bipasha can foresee other people's future but cant help herself. The film also gets slow paced and the audience gets fidgety. Even Abhishek's character(was added much later in the film after half the shooting was over) seems like an add-on. The climax is a downer, with all of a sudden things sorted out in typical Bollywood manner. There are several scenes hard to digest tooDirection by Mahesh Manjerekar could be better though some scenes are well handled Music is good, Quero is good, One Love is well adapted though not as good as the original, the best song is Jannat hai Yeh ZameenAmongst actors Bipasha in the main role does her role well and suits the part. Sanjay Dutt is restrained, Suneil Shetty is superb in an unusual role Dino Morea surprises with an excellent performance(kudos to Mahesh) Amrita Arora is superb, Neha Dhupia is okay, Payal Rohatgi is alright Himanshu Malik is not too convincing, he never impressed as an actor otherwise too Rajat Bedi, Sharat Saxena, Shashikala, Shivaji Satham are okay 
tt0418096; A lot has been expected from this suppose to be a bone-chilling super-natural thriller, especially when it is a product from Mahesh V. Manjrekar's stable but alas it proved to be a dud. The only interesting thing in this film is with each happening, you can put a how or why and look for answers till the end. A mother -cum-widow-cum-tarot card reader-cum-astrologer (Bipasha Basu) not just predict the mishaps of the future but also occasionally helped by souls of dead people. It's been told that her livelihood is only husband's insurance and people's charity but still she manages to live in a lavish bungalow alone with no servant. So that whenever she had a nightmare she can shiver alone and cannot run anywhere else for help. One of the most noisiest sound track (heightened effects) of recent times and a narration is as slow as a snail, what else can be said about this pathetic piece of work. It makes your blood boil. 
tt0418096; It's an annoying remake of the better film 'The Gift' but the only saving grace for 'Rakht' is the really nice songs that are included. Especially 'One Love' which is one of the best commercial songs I have ever seen in a bollywood film. The video for it is nice as well, with Abhishek Bachchan (who is shamefully wasted and exploited in the film) and Bipasha Basu (playing the Cate Blanchett role) picturing the wonderful song with such playful flirtation, it's inspiring! If the directors were not so preoccupied with doing a scene by scene copy of the former, maybe they would have been able to add some spice to their remake. My 8 out of 10 stars vote is strictly for the song and dance numbers which are a really nice addition to the film. The script (however copied and executed) gets a 4 at best! 
tt0418096;  I don't understand why so many people get bent over if a movie is a remake or not. If the movie just remake everything right then it'll be enjoyable.Sure the movie is a remake of Hollywood's The Gift. So what! Even Hollywood movies had been remade before. No big deal.While watching the film, flashback of the original movie The Gift kept popping in my mind. It didn't bother me. I just like to see how Bollywood would pull this off.I loved Rakht. Bips is a natural and is the best. Everyone in the film fitted perfectly. Some argued that Suniel's character was strange but not me. He was awesome. The only person I was disappointed in is Yana Gupta! Yes, she's there for an item number but I felt her item number was overrated. Give me "One Love" any day!This is a Bollywood style movie so that's why it has a "happy" ending.  
tt0339209; This movie was amazingly bad. The characters were cardboard, the script was painfully poorly written, and to top it off, the story (and I use that word loosely) was boring. Also, I had the feeling I was watching home movie by someone who had a video camera handy and a few hours to spare. Having watched several of the recent gay themed movies, and in spite of the fact that many of them have also had limited budgets, several of the others were able to pull the viewer into a story with the element of drama, emotion and a connection to the characters. Most of the time spent watching Issues 101, I couldn't keep enough interest to see if the story was in fact going anywhere, nor did I really care what happened to any of these characters. So regardless of budget, this film could have been made so much better. Enough said. 
tt0339209; Okay, just like most of the other reviewers, I can find very little positive to say. Joe was too old to be a "frat boy". Christian was so obviously flaming gay I'm surprised he didn't spontaneous combust on screen. the set was obviously an empty house rented for the feature because no frat house is gonna have all those empty walls, and empty bookshelves. Some of the scenes, everyone was crowded very tightly. there was no chemistry between ANY of the players. the music and lyrics was laughable. The Pi Pi Rho house was just a wall with people standing in front of it. The Sig fraternity president was go gay there's no way anyone could NOT know that he was. the "hazing" incident, while kinda hot in a gay porn kind of way, was entirely unbelievable. The pace was plodding and slow and then suddenly rushed. The movie ending left the whole thing feeling incomplete. I read on here they ran out of money, that probably explains that.I gave it a two just because some of the actors are very easy on the eyes, and there's some nice ass shots, as well as one sorta hot sex scene and few full frontals (or maybe just one, i forget actually).I would not rent this. I certainly wouldn't buy it under any circumstances. I think whoever made this film had the best of intentions at heart. unfortunately, best intentions do NOT a good movie make. 
tt0339209; Issues 101 is without a doubt the worst movie ever made, with absolutely no redeeming values except for a few shots of some nice boy ass, and proves once again that anyone with a cheap video cam and a few friends can make a film. Not only is the story absurd and the acting so amateurish that it rivals the worst kindergarten play, but the characters are so stereotyped that gay and straight people alike will be offended by the depiction of the characters. It was like watching a train wreck, I could not avert my eyes and I was horrified the entire time. God only knows why I watched the whole movie. Most gay actors are capable of portraying straight men with no problem, these guys were not. The gay characters were total flames, vapid and shallow and able to fall in love and have their hearts broken in the time it takes most of us to enjoy a good meal. The so-called straight characters were not far behind. One expected them all to drop their pants at any given moment and have an orgy in the fraternity house. To wit, did the writer, director or any of the people involved in the making of this trash ever go to college or ever go inside a fraternity house??? Quite frankly, I've seen more convincing acting and stories in gay porn films.In short, I cannot say enough bad things about this piece of garbage and would exhort any reader to avoid this movie like the plague. 
tt0339209;  Unfortunately, this film should be mandatory viewing for film makers, so that they can see what mistakes NOT to make in their films.Issues 101 has real problems. As a romantic drama it's a failure. Seeing this film only a few hours after watching Andy Warhol's Trash led me to question why Trash is so riveting (albeit in a sick car-crash sort of way) while Issues 101 required real force of will to watch to the bitter end.Neither film has well scripted dialogue and yet they couldn't be more different in their audience impact. One is fascinating to watch and one is painful to watch. Somehow in Trash we see beyond the flaws and imperfections and see that there is truth (in this case what it must have really been like to be in a dead end relationship with a junkie in late 60's NYC) In Issues 101, we see no such truth. The reality of the digital video contrasts wildly with the inane dialogue (lacking in both sense and substance). The result is an insipid film lacking in truth, excitement or interest. The flaws were so off-putting as to keep yanking the viewer back to the `real world' and not allowing for the willing suspension of disbelief that works for most films. The REAL problem for me with Issues 101 is that it gives me a terrible case of the `might-have-beens.'  For the most part the actors were pleasing to the eye and the ideas presented in the story could have been told so much better. On the surface, a story about a fraternity pledge that somehow gets through a chink in his frat brother's straight faA§ade, the frat brother setting the pledge up with his younger fraternal gay brother to take some of the pressure off, and the jealousy that ensues are all great plot elements. However in this film almost none of it works. The sex with the supposedly straight brother goes way too far without an adequate `gosh was I drunk set-up'. The whirlwind speed with which the pledge and the younger brother get seriously involved happens way too quickly. And finally the pledge causing all these issues is neither handsome enough nor charming enough to make us believe that either brother would be interested in him.To make matters worse there were scenes that were totally unmotivated and others that were totally unnecessary. I understand that this film ran out of money near the end and so much was lost in the director's vision but overall what was left is nearly unwatchable and actually painful to sit through.   
tt0339209;  Yes, I've seen this, and yes, I think it is awful.  However, if you want to see what a bad film is and learn what NOT to do, I would definitely recommend this.  Kelly Clarkson is among the very few good-looking people in this movie, unfortunately.  The best thing I can say about this film is that it made me laugh...one of those laughing at it, not with it deals, you know what I mean.  Rent it, and I'm sure you'll go through all the physical motions, including laughter, nausea, diahrrea, anger, disappointment, more nausea, some laughter, and finally, you'll be happy (because it's over). 
tt0339209; My only question is was this a straight guy trying to tell a gay story? The scenes were non-sequiters bouncing from one set of characters to another, the storyline was not planned nor sequential, and seeing scenes from day to night to day in what appeared to be a five minute dialogue was confusing. Just not very good. I couldn't understand how off to college Joe (I assume at age 18) was what appeared to be a 32 year old man and was giving such sage advice in one scene and then was so naive in the next. In contrast, Christian, his older fraternity brother, looked 18. Casting was odd. I'm not sure why so many of the guys showed their backsides except to give the viewer some eye-candy. But I will say, it was some nice eye-candy. 
tt0339209; I saw this film on HERE. There is NO "here" here. Filmed on what looked like videotape, this is a new low in gay-themed story telling. Unbelievable on every level. I fast forwarded through most of it, though the "actor" playing Christian was an eye-candy respite. The movie left me with "issues". Why did I ever watch it? Poorly written, poorly acted, poorly filmed, miscast lead, incredible story line - and these are its GOOD points! Caveat emptor. To sum up: an average looking gay Joe goes to college and is immediately inducted into a "straight" fraternity(my gaydar went off the screen)after some preposterous gay hazing. Love blooms, conflict occurs, the green monster appears, all ends happily (questionable), and everyone dances off on the yellow brick road. I can't wait for the sequel. 
tt0339209; ISSUES 101? So did I miss the other 100 volumes in this series? If so, THANK YOU! I just know there is a hardcore gay porn cut of this vid out there somewhere. If you find a copy, do me a favor and cut out all the boring, talky parts first. This vid has the worst dialogue ever made up during Rush Week. The actors are cute enough, sure - but the word 'acting' should be omitted from their resumes. The videography isn't awful - it's worse. One scene is shot against a flat stucco wall, and another against a pane of windows reflecting the glare of the minimal camera lights. I played a fun game while watching ISSUES 101 (No, not that! Dirty-minded IMDb users!) - I pretended I was on a gay version of "Mystery Science Theatre 3000"! I cracked myself up! It was fab! As for ISSUES, I just hope there isn't a 102. 
tt0339209; Movie about a college guy who is confused about his sexuality. He's in a fraternity and keeps it hidden from his fraternity brothers. Then he meets a male student he's attracted to and things come out in the open.PLOT SPOILERS!!! I caught this a few years ago at a Gay & Lesbian Film Festival. I had blocked it--for good reason--until I saw it here. It's all come roaring back. First off, the basic plot is OK but this takes forever to get going. Secondly, the acting really REALLY sucks. I notice that most of the "actors" here never made another movie. Thirdly, it's flatly directed with faded color and occasionally inaudible sound. Fourth, you don't care about the characters or situations for one second. Five, the reactions of the fraternity brothers to one of their own being gay were so accepting it's almost comical. Six, it's so obvious the two actors are hating every second of the(one)gay kiss in this. Some people mention there was some full frontal nudity and butt shots (I seriously don't remember any) but you don't want to see ANY of these guys nude. You can rent a gay porno for hot nude guys.This may have been made with serious intentions but the lousy script and bad acting destroy it. At the film festival this was met with dead silence and lots of people walked out complaining how bad it was. There are many other better gay movies out there. Skip this one. 
tt0339209;  *Warning, potential spoiler in first paragraph* Joe, who is out (only) to Family and Friends, joins a fraternity. The love-jealousy-relationship-friendship-triangle between Joe, his fratmate Chris and Chris's gay brother Michael is superbly portrayed, including lots of tiny subplots and unexpected twists. The fraternity has to deal with Joe's homosexuality like everyone else, gay, straight, or "straight with issues". While "Defying Gravity" by John Keitel (a great film) deals only with the question of coming out within a fraternity, "Issues 101" tries to grasp the (potentially homosexual and homoerotic) feelings of the other characters as well.All actors are doing a great job. It feels so real, like you have just experienced it yourself. So where is the But...?Unfortunately it seems, that they ran out of money. There is too much footage included of the beginning of the story, making it progress very slow at times, while towards the end major issues are wrapped up in a single scene and not explored enough. Also the camera is too static at times. The timeline is very linear, maybe a flashback could have helped to make it feel less documentary? (More) Background music / noise might have helped as well, if not only to create a general atmosphere or give the audience information on the feelings of the characters.All in all, with more money and time, this great plot could have made it into a great film, but the way it is (with its beginners mistakes), unfortunately it will most probably stumble on its way there. Yet I hope that the filmmakers have the courage to continue. 
tt0017567;  Thanks to the kindness of an IMDB reader I was able to obtain a video copy of this rare silent and indeed it lives up to its reputation.  Briskly told and quite well directed by Henry King, it is both beautiful to look at and excitingly engrossing.Barbara (Vilma Banky) is a foundling brought up by Mr. Worth whose vision is to bring water to the desert through irrigation.  Enter Ronald Colman as the dashing second in command of an entrepreneur, who intends to make this happen.  Barbara is of course enamored of him but her childhood sweetheart, Gary Cooper, is wary.The developer fires all of the workers once the work is done and refuses to reinforce the dam - all this foolishness to save money.There is a dashing race to prevent a riot when Worth's payroll cannot be met and the inevitable flash flood which causes the river to rise, break through the dam and flood/destroy the town.Cinematography is breathtaking with some exquisitely composed shots and beautiful use of light and shadow.  The special effects are amazing for its time.This is a special western and a special movie - it should be commercially released on video by a reputable firm using 35 mm nitrate materials which are known to still exist in pristine condition in the Goldwyn archives.Seek this one out! 
tt0017567; There is no mention of the source of the music, but Gaylord Carter played his improvised score for a special showing of The Winning of Barbara Worth on January 28, 1971, and it's a recording of that performance which turned up on the DVD. The instrument was a 36-rank Wurlitzer Pipe Organ. Henry King and Frances Goldwyn were in the audience and both spoke after the film. I was there. Mr. King described his search for a desert that looked like a desert, after finding the Mojave in bloom. He also recalled hearing Gaylord Carter play the organ at the Million Dollar Theatre in Los Angeles in the 1920's, soon after Harold Lloyd recommended Gaylord for the job. 
tt0017567; Beautifully photographed epic silent western following the story of a toddler baby girl caught in a desert sandstorm that kills her mother, the child's only surviving parent on their family's wagon trek along a lonely desert trail. Rescued by a man named Jefferson Worth, soon little orphan Barbara becomes his adopted daughter - cut to fifteen years later, where our Barbara (played by Vilma Banky) is now a young beauty living with papa in the small desert town of Rubio City. Enter new arrival, Willard Holmes, engineer set to help bring water to the desert and turn it into a garden spot. Of course he's handsome (well, he's played by Ronald Colman, after all) - but Barbara already has a local fellow, Abe Lee (Gary Cooper), who is completely smitten over her (and extremely handsome too - how's a girl to choose?!). Holmes actively pursues Barbara while Abe Lee watches from the background - but soon a misunderstanding leaves the whole town believing Holmes is a money hungry bad man! This film is a stunning visual masterpiece showcasing images of wagons and people and horses moving against a backdrop of yellow-tinted sun-lit desert that looks absolutely gorgeous, not to mention the exciting flood climax featuring a fast-paced race on foot and wagon between the townspeople and the approaching roar of the Colorado river which is expertly brought to life. The DVD of this features a totally gorgeous tinted print that really makes the cinematography in this pop, plus a well done organ score done before a live audience (who you can sometimes hear laughing in the background). A really excellent film. 
tt0017567; I cannot tell you how excited I was to find this DVD at my local library. I have the entire collection of Wright's books and recognized the title instantly. Amazingly, the director and screenplay writer took the story as it is in the book and relayed it beautifully. This is supreme acting when you can pretty well tell what's being said even before the words show up on the screen. BRAVO!!!! This would be a great story for the history buffs as well as silent screen aficionados. This is the first of many great films starring Gary Cooper and it is easy to see why he made it in the acting field. His rival for Barbara's hand is Ronald Coleman and what a dashing rival he makes! I was unfamiliar with the heroine but she too was a wonderful actress. This is a part of history I had not been aware of until I read the book. It is a must-see! 
tt0017567; When sound films came in Vilma Banky's career was over. She hadn't learned to speak English that well and had a very thick accent, but besides she didn't really care. She had married Rod La Roque a couple of years before and their marriage proved to be one of the happiest in Hollywood. So she was quite happy to retire. Samuel Goldwyn had discovered her on a talent hunt through Europe and bought her to Hollywood where she was frequently co-starred with Ronald Colman. She also co-starred with Rudolph Valentino in "The Eagle" and "Son of the Sheik", and then it was back to Ronald Colman for "The Winning of Barbara Worth". This was one of the great epic Westerns of the 20s, along with "The Covered Wagon" (1923) and "The Iron Horse" (1924). Neither Colman nor Banky where keen about going to Nevada for location shooting and Gary Cooper was only signed for his role a few days before filming began.Set around the turn of last century in Kingston, a south western desert town, when civilization was fast encroaching on the old west and it's ways. Automobiles were owned and trains could make traveling to the big cities easier. The story is about bringing irrigation to the dry West.The first thing I noticed was the beautiful tints and the stylized images, certainly in the opening sequences. While a woman (Vilma Banky) has just buried her husband in the unforgiving desert, Jefferson Worth has come West with the dream of bringing irrigation to make the barren land into a paradise. During a terrible dust storm (a really stunning sequence) Jefferson finds the little girl "Barba", kneeling by her dead mother.Fifteen years later Jefferson realises his dream to bring water to the parched desert and has pride in his adopted daughter Barbara Worth (Vilma Banky). Abe Lee (Gary Cooper) son of Jefferson's old friend is in love with Barbara, but after she has a riding accident, Holmes (Ronald Colman), partner of a newly arrived land developer, offers his assistance. Gary Cooper looks so gorgeously young, it is unbelievable that Barbara would choose the rather stuffy Ronald Colman.Mr. Greenfield, his partner has been hired to build a dam for the town of Kingston. The vast panorama of the desert, complete with the burnished amber tints make this film, to me, a "vision splendid". The scene where the dam is filled is wonderful. Greenfield is a charlatan and has skipped town rather than spend money re-enforcing the dam. He also sacks all of Worth's people for spreading malicious "lies" about a flood that will destroy the town. So most of the townsfolk go in search of safer ground. Jefferson founds a new town - Barba, built high on a mesa but because of Greenfield's blockade, he finds he cannot meet his payroll. Holmes, who is completely innocent of Greenfield's plans, is secretly appealing to the bankers on Worth's behalf. When the people realize they cannot be paid, they want to burn down the town. Barbara is left alone but some of the men are in Little Rosebud's gang and she is attacked. Abe has been entrusted with the payroll but on the way he is shot by one of Rosebud's gang and realises that Holmes is decent and on the level when he saves Abe's life and delivers the payroll himself.The flooding of the Colorado River is spectacularly done. As the residents of Kingston flee to the high country of Barba, there are some amazing images of people escaping the flood ravaged town. Little bedraggled children, a man sleeping on the roof, a man running out of his bath, a man trying to escape on his wheelchair and a donkey going wild and upending a load, while the relentless river engulfs the town.It is a spectacular film, worthy of a re-look. An interesting scene showed a cushion embroided with a swastika - originally a native American symbol of good will. I also thought I saw Clarence Wilson in a bit as a barber and Clyde Cooke, a silent film comedian, played Tex, a comic sidekick. On my copy Gaylord Carter provided the organ accompaniment.Highly Recommended. 
tt0017567; The first thing I thought when I saw this film was "wow--what a great print"--and it's true, the DVD of this film is amazingly well-preserved and the tinting really worked well (it's unusual to see amber tinting but it worked with the desert scenes). The only negative about the DVD is that it has no extras--none at all.The film begins with a woman and her children stuck in the desert. One has already died and she and the young girl are next. However, another wagon arrives soon after and the girl, Barbara, is saved--but it's too late for the mother.Years pass and Barbara is now a pretty young lady. She is loved by Gary Cooper and you'd naturally assume they were intended for each other. A bit later in the film, Ronald Colman comes to this desert town to help build a canal to the Colorado River. He, too, is smitten with Barbara. But before he can marry her, a series of events (naturally) occur to make her hate Colman--even though he really is a good guy and she's misunderstood him. Late in the film, Colman proves himself to be some guy by saving Cooper's life, bringing the payroll to town just before the fickle townspeople burn the place down(?) AND he tries with all his strength to keep the valley from flooding when the river crests. This leads to one of the more amazing scenes in silent history--the flooding of the town. When all is said and done, however, Barbara and Colman are together and everyone lives happily ever after.While the plot is every bit formulaic (with the necessary mistaken impression that jeopardizes their love AND the way he saves the day and her heart), the film itself is so impressive technically that you gotta like it and respect all the work that went to make this incredible film. So, for the plot, I'd give it a 5 and the special effects a 10--leaving a score of 7.5 overall. But, since 7.5 isn't allowed, I'll round it up to 8.By the way, I have heard or read many people say that either WINGS or IT (both Clara Bow starring films) were the "big breakthrough" films for Gary Cooper, but this is NOT true. First, his roles in both were tiny (particularly in IT but both parts lasted only a couple minutes). Secondly, his role in THE WINNING OF BARBARA WORTH was made a year earlier and was a much, much more substantial part.Also, I'd like to add one more comment in case there is any misunderstanding. In a brief scene near the end, there is a throw pillow on the couch with a giant swastika on it. This was NOT a Nazi reference, as the symbol is at least a couple thousand years old (originating in Asia) and the American-Indians often used it--as did many cultures. 
tt0017567; Gary Cooper was one of the most consistently popular stars of classic cinema from the beginning of the talkie era to his death in 1961. However there is a lesser-known early chapter to his career, when he played supporting roles in a series of silent pictures. He never achieved stardom in this period, in part because a lot of his appeal was founded in his warm, steady voice. Still, his charming persona was enough to shine through even in these non-speaking days, as this, his first credited appearance, shows.The Winning of Barbara Worth was a prestigious picture in its day, directed by the respected and capable Henry King. King was really good at these human dramas played out against a grand backdrop. On the one hand he keeps the vastness and deadly potential of the desert a continual presence, with landscape shots that seem to go on forever. But on the other hand he is not averse to stripping away all other business to just focus us on people and their faces. There are some really neat close-ups here, such as Gary Cooper jealously spying on Vilma Banky with Ronald Colman, or Banky as she walks out on Colman. These shots aren't overused, and they seem to segue naturally into the editing pattern rather than being "look-at-this" attention-grabbers. But what is really impressive is the way King can arrange things to tell the big story and the intimate one simultaneously. Look at the scene in which the water flows into the irrigation system. The crowd cheer and dance ecstatically, but the main characters who have put more into this than any other are stood still, as if overcome with emotion. There are a handful of close-ups of various reactions, and then we see Banky and Colman share their first kiss, and all the liveliness behind them reflects the intensity of the moment. As the kiss breaks off there is a sudden feeling of awkwardness between them, and the slowing of the crowd seems to mimic this too.And this is very much a *silent* drama of reactions, expressions, motions and body language. Gary Cooper may not have his voice here but he does have that deep, sensitive face and steady, deliberate way of moving. His acting is only passable at this stage, but he has the look of a man one can implicitly trust, and this goes a long way in screen stardom. And yet for this picture Cooper is ostensibly the third wheel, behind dapper, moustachioed lead man Ronald Colman. Colman was a very decent dramatic player, and as with Cooper there was something innately likable about his manner which secured his success into the sound era. Colman is very good here, and it is only his experience as an actor coupled with his own honesty and simplicity that prevent him being outshone by Cooper. The leading lady is Vilma Banky, who shot to fame as the object of ravishment for Rudolph Valentino. In this slightly more grown-up picture she reveals herself to be a very fine actress, and like her two male co-stars she has a capacity for deeply expressive reacting. Sadly her career was to fizzle out in the sound era, probably because English was not her first language.Story-wise, The Winning of Barbara Worth is a tale of progress and prosperity that is very typical of Roaring Twenties optimism. And perhaps herein lies another reason why Cooper didn't become a cinematic icon until a few years later. The end of the silent era happened to coincide with the beginning of the great depression. Before that, Cooper's down-to-earth nature didn't really fit with the grandiose flights of fancy that made up most of 1920s cinema. However by the 1930s, cinema had suddenly become very different in its scope and focus. Heroes became ordinary men who worked for a living, and the heroin really would marry the boy next door. As it is, this picture sees Cooper as the homely type whom Banky loves as a brother. There's no real problem with this Â<U+0096> Cooper isn't miscast, he's simply in the wrong time for lead roles Â<U+0096> and he plays his part aptly in what is a very worthy 20s drama. 
tt0017567; During the silent screen years Ronald Colman and Vilma Banky were a popular screen team and The Winning Of Barbara Worth was their first film together. Neither Colman or Banky was particularly happy with doing a western and certainly neither are players you would think of for a western. But in the days of the silent screen you could not hear Colman's cultured English tones or Banky's thick Hungarian accent which killed her career in sound films.The Winning Of Barbara Worth is a modern western set in 1926 Arizona where Banky's father is the local head honcho in a small town. Father Charles Lane has a dream of building a dam and irrigating the desert and turning it into an agricultural paradise. But he puts his trust and the hard earned cash of his people into the hands of the unscrupulous E.J. Ratcliffe who cut many corners and built one inferior dam. His chief engineer Ronald Colman points that out to him and his fired for his trouble.Undaunted, Colman gets new backing from millionaire Fred Esmelton and goes to work on a new dam. Which does not fit in Ratcliffe's plans and he tries to stop Colman by fair means or foul. Colman also has eyes for Banky, but she's already got Gary Cooper courting her. And Coop's the jealous type and does not think Colman is on the up and up.Henry King whose career in films spanned over 40 years and was the top contract director at 20th Century Fox during sound did a great job both with his live players and the cinematography. The overflowing dam and subsequent flood was of DeMille like quality.Maybe Ronald Colman and Vilma Banky aren't what many would consider western names, but that sure can't be said about Gary Cooper for whom this was his first featured role. Coop had done many bit roles in silents up to this time, but he was a complete unknown at this time and The Winning Of Barbara Worth was his first part with billing. You probably could not have made this film during sound with the voices of Colman and Banky, but when Cooper uttered his first screen words in Wolf Song, this man's voice perfectly suited the characters he had been playing on the screen already. In fact both Colman and Cooper went on to far bigger careers because of sound unlike poor Vilma Banky who barely spoke any English.In the scenes he's in Gary Cooper steals the film and there was no doubt this man was going to be a major star. The Winning Of Barbara Worth holds up very well as drama and with Gary Cooper a star was born. 
tt0017567; The Winning of Barbara Worth as seen on a nicely restored DVD in MGM's Gary Cooper Collection, is a beautifully filmed, well acted, "modern" western with impressive special effects in a spectacular flood scene. Unfortunately the sappy, simplistic story -- more suitable for a Saturday matinA©e kiddie western than a top dollar movie -- undoes much of the good imparted by the high production values. It is hardly the classic many have over-rated it. It is still fairly entertaining and worth watching, if nothing else for the curio value of seeing a young Gary Cooper in his first big roll, playing second banana behind well-established star Ronald Coleman.The cinematography by Georges Barnes and Gregg Toland are really what save this movie from being an over-baked turkey. The shots of the desert especially in the opening sequence are breathtaking. The effects were greatly enhanced by the burnt sienna sepia tints used in this monochromatic color movie for all scenes, indoor and outdoor, except for the night scenes, which were the traditional blue. Director Henry King does an excellent job with the action sequences, especially the panicked crowd of townspeople fleeing from onrushing flood waters. On the other hand he handles his actors in the drama scenes in a very stilted and high histrionic manner already going out of style in this the late silent era. There were times when I feared Vilma Banky would wear the front of her beautiful blonde hair off from repeatedly throwing the back of her hand to her forehead. Ronald Coleman, nevertheless, managed to keep his understated (for the silent era) acting style in trim throughout. Cooper, no doubt being less sure of himself at this early point in his career, sometimes succumbs to deep silent histrionics. In a few scenes, however, we see flashes of his brilliantly understated style of the future.The story, based on a Harold Bell Wright novel, relies on two hackneyed plot devices -- 1) a syrupy love triangle with Coleman and Cooper both smitten by the lovely Banky (and what men wouldn't be!) 2) A robber baron speculator exploiting the poor folks. The robber baron being Coleman's father ties the two together. That wouldn't be so bad, since they ran out of new stories centuries ago, but neither of the two plot lines is very well developed, and plot holes abound. For instance, why was the rich robber Baron so set against spending the money to reinforce the dam, when it was his investment, the town, which would be washed away if the dam broke. And no less a trusted authority than his engineer son had advised him it was likely to burst. As to the lovey-dovey stuff, Vilma's relationships with neither of her two suitors was well developed enough to justify all the fuss.A good watch nevertheless. But a pretty crude movie in many ways for the late silent era. Compare with the Greta Garbo opus The Temptress, released the same year. Wouldn't be fair to compare sweet little Vilma Banky's E-for-effort acting with that of the Great Garbo! I won't. But the general style of the acting in The Temptress is much more sophisticated and so is the story line, though both are still plenty florid by the later talkie standard. The Temptress also features a dam burst, and it is every bit if not more spectacular than the one in Barbara Worth.A criticism has been made that there are too many cutaways for dialog placards in this picture, and I must agree. But this seems to have been a common ailment creeping into late silent movies, possibly in an effort to bring a deeper dramatic depth to the movies. Perhaps this was simply a sign that is was time for the movies to start talking. And that was right around the corner!------------------------- A Special Thanks to fellow reviewer simonton-4 for cluing us in on the source of the pipe organ music score of the current DVD (see his review). The fact that it was a live, improvised performance recorded at a showing of the movie explains why we occasionally hear laughing, coughing, scuffing of feet. It gives the viewer a sense of what it would have been like watching The Winning of Barbra Worth in a 1926 movie house with only a live performance of one or more musical instruments providing sound for the movie. Much more like the original silent movie viewer's experience than the tightly synchronized orchestral scores usually canned with the dvds, which in effect makes them technically sound movies (see my review of Old Wives For New for a further discussion of this issue). 
tt0017567; A 1926 silent-era western. The Barbara in question is the adopted daughter of a western pioneer. His plan to irrigate his area from the Colorado river is picked up by a New York financier. One of my favorite actors, Ronald Colman is the engineer set to head up the project. He immediately becomes a love interest for Barbara. His main romantic adversary though, is Gary Cooper, a local hometown boy with unresolved feelings for the lady.Everyone, however, is faced with a bigger problem. The corporate financier is playing hardball and cutting financial ties with the settlers. While I've always loved Colman, and always hated Cooper, that becomes less relevant being that this is a silent film. Acting is not the biggest conveyor in the storytelling. The film here was remarkably well-preserved, some of it shot in Nevada locations. Not a genre I will be investigating fully, but a fun one-off nonetheless. 
tt0327403; One of Aamir Khan's earlier movies, it may have not been watched as much as other latest releases of him. But the movie is a very cute lovestory. Aamir Khan as a disobedient college student looks very good and Neelam was very beautiful. The story is not very outstanding but it was O.K. The music is also not bad. The main beauty of the movie for me is its background music. Marks analysis: Aamir Khan(1) + Neelam(1) + Other cast(1) + Music(1/2) + Direction(1/2) + Script(1/2) + Dialogues(1/2) + Locations(1/2) + Personal Attraction(1) + Background Music(1).

tt0031677; Moto #7/8 finds us in "Porto Rico" with a great print, some nice sets and atmospheric photography and a sterling cast giving the flimsy plot all they had.Moto played as ever by Peter Lorre is called in by the Government in cahoots with the Governor to root out an international gang of diamond smugglers, discovers straight away that one the Governor's confidantes must be one of the baddies, if not the top dirty dog. Just picture the high profile suspects: Leon Ames, Douglas Dumbrille, Richard Lane, Jean Hersholt, Charles Brown or even Robert Lowery, all shifty and at each others throats from the word go but which one is guilty? At least Moto's sidekick wrestler Warren Hymer has no doubts, even if he is paradoxically also continually bewildered. Mention ghosts and Willie Best makes an appearance! The dialogue was surprisingly witty, the production values high - from the delightful evening party to the beads of sweat on various foreheads. The running gag was supplied by McGurk's unstinting admiration for Moto always besting him at judo - he sure took some beating and shooting at in here!Great non-heavy entertainment as usual, an excellent entry in the series. 
tt0031677; This is a murder mystery, with Mr. Moto, for those of you who don't know, as the crafty man investigating the case. Like Charlie Chan, he's a private investigator.Peter Lorre had a "cool" charisma about him, much like Basil Rathbone, Humphrey Bogart, and others who played such roles.Films like this either take one or a combination of two of the following: 1. Mystery with clues that the audience can use. 2. Mystery with atmosphere and humor 3. Mystery with a twist.Just about none have all three. One may cite "Chinatown" as a possibility, but the atmosphere isn't what I would call strong in that one. Atmosphere and humor come either without twists or without clues.This film uses the first two elements. It would be far fetched to say there is a twist. There is an abundance of atmosphere and humor, and many clues. We know very soon who the killer is. At first it isn't easy, because all of the suspects look alike, middle aged white men with mustaches, but once we tell them apart, and once the atmosphere is established, we do know which one it is.That doesn't take away from the adventure, though. Lots of good elements make this an enjoyable film. 
tt0031677; Peter Lorre stars as Japanese investigator Mr. Moto in "Mr. Moto in Danger Island," a 1939 release also starring Jean Hersholt, Amanda Duff, Walter Hymer, Douglas Dumbrille, and Leon Ames. Originally written as a Charlie Chan script, Moto is asked to investigate the smuggling of inexpensive contraband diamonds from South America via Puerto Rico and into the U.S. that are driving down diamond prices. One investigator has already been murdered, so it's time to send in the big guns - Moto.A professional wrestler named Twister McGurk (Hymer), whom Moto meets en route to Puerto Rico, attaches himself to the diminutive detective, which brings some comic relief.Entertaining with a nice tropical atmosphere despite being made on a back lot, and it's always a joy to see Peter Lorre. Unfortunately for Mr. Moto, World War II ended his run. 
tt0031677; Calling this a typical Moto film is not a bad thing. After all, this series from Twentieth-Century Fox was about the equal in quality to their other series, Charlie Chan. The big difference being that Moto is more a "gun for hire"--a man who would play private detective or even mercenary in his films. Unlike the squeaky clean and rather sedate Chan, Moto is more physical and not above twisting the law or even killing someone. Sadly, he didn't kill anyone in this film--always a trademark of a great Moto film! Moto is on his way to Puerto Rico to investigate a diamond smuggling ring. However, on the way, he is laid out due to an appendicitis and it looks like Moto might have to drop the case. However, being a very sneaky character, there's a lot more to the story than this. Along for the ride is Warren Hymer, who plays Moto's new friend who tags along during the investigation. Having Hymer in the film makes sense, however, as the film was originally planned another Chan film. But, since Warner Oland had recently died, the script was adapted for Peter Lorre's series. In the usual role of Number One or Number Two son is Hymer--who gets into trouble and makes a nuisance of himself just like he was an honorary Chan himself! Overall, well written, exciting and up to the usual high standards of the series. The only serious knock I have against this film is that although it's set in Puerto Rico, there's no one who remotely looks or sounds Hispanic in the film. Of course, considering they have a German guy playing Moto, I guess this shouldn't come as much of a surprise. 
tt0031677; Another entry in the late 1930's Mr. Moto series from Twentieth Century Fox, this one finds the Japanese sleuth in an adventure on the island of Puerto Rico. As in the first film, "Think Fast, Mr. Moto", the plot involves a diamond smuggling operation, and it too involves transport of the gems via cruise ships, however most of Mr. Moto's (Peter Lorre) investigation takes place on dry land.One of the things I liked about the early Charlie Chan movies from Fox were the references often made to events in a prior picture. In this story, Moto allows himself to be mistaken for a Japanese outlaw named Shimura. When Commissioner Gordon (Richard Lane) converses with a government official in the U.S., he learns that Moto will use any ruse as part of his investigation, learning of the escape from a Devil's Island prison camp in the prior movie, "Mysterious Mr. Moto". It's those little insertions that make the Oriental Detective movies so much fun for me.As in all the Moto films, this one features the sleuth in various martial arts scenes, but with a noticeable difference. In all the prior stories, the fights were almost always staged in very dim, even dark locations. The ones on display here are done in broad daylight, but even so, it's impossible to detect the stunt man (Harvey Parry) responsible for the flips and throws. Speaking of which, even Douglas Dumbrille's character La Costa manages to get a round house kick in on Moto's sidekick in the film, wrestler Twister McGurk (Warren Hymer). Twister becomes Moto's shadow for virtually the entire picture, thanks in part to Moto's distraction of opponent Sailor Sam in the film's opening sequence. Anyone else do a double take to see Ward Bond in that role?Keep an eye on the scenes involving Moto's second trip into the swamp in the latter half of the film. The lower half of Mr. Moto's pants are alternately muddy and clean in scenes that take place at the villains' camp.Some viewers may find the later pictures in the Moto series to be inferior to the early ones, but I have to say that this one was as entertaining to me as the ones that went before. By now one has a pretty good sense of how Moto operates, solving the crime via a series of masquerades, martial arts and clever analysis. The addition of some comic relief to this film by way of Twister's malapropisms was just the right touch to keep things moving along briskly. 
tt0031677;  This is one of the later Moto pictures and not as good as the earlier ones. Peter Lorre is his usual great self. And, there is a great nostalgic sense of the time and setting. But it doesn't have as much life as the previous entries in the series. It is still worth seeing. Just don't expect to see Moto at his best. It is better than "Mr. Moto's Gamble" and far better than the 60's attempt at reviving the character, "The Return of Mr. Moto". This was based on the novel, "Murder in Trinidad" which did not feature Moto and was filmed before and since. For this film the locale was changed to Puerto Rico. At one time this was slated to be filmed as a Charlie Chan film, "Charlie Chan in Trinidad". 
tt0031677; ***SPOILERS*** Mr. Moto, Peter Lorre, is sent to the island of Puerto Rico to check out a diamond smuggling ring that's responsible for the murder of a Government Agent, Rodney Graham, who had infiltrated it. Faking an appendicitis attack Mr. Moto and his good friend and bodyguard, as if he needs one, professional wrestler Twister McGurk, Warren Hymen, is kidnapped by the smugglers on his way to the hospital only to lead the local police straight to them. In what was a wild brawl the leader of the group Capt.Dahlen, Eddie Marr, escaped to the Puerto Ricen swamps where his smugging operation originates from. Now again faking that he in fact is not Mr. Motto Mister Motto gets himself, together with Twister McGurk, recruited into the diamond smuggling ring using the allies of wanted and on the lamb hood Yoko Simura.Not one of the better Mr. Moto movies with the fearless and martial arts expert Mr. Motto getting his nice clean and pressed white suit and pants wet and dirtied with mud in the swamps where the diamond smugglers are operating out of. It takes a while for Mr. Moto to find out who's really behind this diamond smuggling ring that has already murdered two people including the Governor of the Island John Bentley, Paul Harvey, who had uncovered his identity. It's when Capt. Dahlen is caught in his attempted escape,on a motor boat, from the law that Mr. Moto devises a fool proof plan to get the head of this diamond smuggling ring to come out in the open. That in him trying to murder the seriously injured Capt. Dahlen before he comes out of his coma and talks to the police!***SPOILERS**** As the saying goes "Dead Men Tell No Tales" and that also goes for Capt. Dahlen. He was dead all the time but the clever Mr. Moto kept that from the person who was to eventually "murder" him to keep him from talking. A neat trick on Mr. Moto's part in having him expose himself by killing Capt. Dahlen a second time, he in fact died in a shoot out with the police on the high seas, in him not knowing that he was dead already! 
tt0031677; Mr. Moto in Danger Island (1939) *** (out of 4)Seventh film in the series finds Mr. Moto (Peter Lorre) tracking down a diamond smuggling ring working from South America through Puerto Rico. Along the way various murders begin to happen with a wide range of suspects. I've read that this was originally intended to be an entry in Fox's Charlie Chan series but it works well as a Moto movie. The movie has a nice pace to it, a great supporting cast and overall nice story, which makes this here another winner. What works the best is the cast and the lead performance by Lorre. He certainly never struck me as looking Japanese but he certainly digs deep into the character and delivers all the goods in terms of manor isms and various gestures that he does throughout. Warren Hymer adds a lot of nice comic touches in his role as the dimwitted wrestler who befriends Moto early on in the film and refuses to leave his side. Richard Lane, from the Boston Blackie series, does a very good job in his role of the Commissioner and we also get nice turns by Jean Hersholt, Amanda Duff, Leon Ames and Paul Harvey. Even though the film is set in Puerto Rico, you really can't tell that but the stuff in the swamp contains some nice atmosphere. The movie is certainly one of the better entries in the series and makes for a nice, fast paced entertainment. 
tt0031677; In the long line of 'politically incorrect' Hollywood racial casting, Hungarian born Peter Lorre's Mr Moto is probably the least in need of historical/cultural apologies to facilitate our enjoyment of the eight dandy pics he made as the polite, but not quite knowable Japanese detective. Most were smartly directed by ex-actor Norman Foster, but this late entry was helmed by 'routinier' Herbert Leeds who brings a good deal less to the party. Still, even when playing more closely within the conventions of drawing room detective yarns (and with too much forced dimwit comic relief), Lorre manages to elevate the slim story about diamond smuggling in the tropics into something entertaining and a bit perverse, with nice support from Jean Hersholt, Leon Ames, Paul Harvey & Douglas Dumbrille all in spiffy white suits. 
tt0031677; Herbert I. Leeds directs Peter Lorre in this episode of the Mr. Moto series. Diamond smugglers in Puerto Rico murder a lead investigator, this forces the U.S. Government to call upon super sleuth Kentaro Moto(Lorre)to further investigate and break up the suspected criminal ring. As always when summoned, Moto's powers of reason prove flawless when dealing with dim-bulb hoodlums. With martial arts and mental prowess, the unassuming and mild mannered Mr. Moto is victorious in meeting the challenge. Deadpan humor is not lost in the crime and drama. The supporting cast features: Jean Hersholt, Richard Lane, Amanda Duff, Leon Ames, Paul Harvey and Warren Hymer, as Twister McGurk. 
tt0101440; Travelers arriving. Travelers departing. This is what Life on a String is about. This is what life is about.Life on a String, an early film by Chen Kaige, the director of Farewell My Concubine, is based on a story by Tiesheng Shi about two blind people, a singer/saint referred to as Old Master and his young apprentice Shitou. Old Master learned when he was a small boy that following the breaking of 1,000 strings on his banjo, his sight will be restored. This film is about his quest. It is essentially a meditation on vision and blindness, silence and song, and life and death. It is a serene, touching, and beautiful film, but not for the attention-span challenged.Old Master (Liu Zhongyuan), leads his blind apprentice Shitou (Huang Lei) on the road through an awe-inspiring landscape of mountains and rivers in Western China. Old Master is frail and counts the days when the final string will be broken and Shitou will take his place. His student, however, wants a different type of life. He wants romance and when he meets and falls in love with a young villager (Xu Qing), he goes against his master's wishes to be with her.Life on a String is saturated with wondrous folk music from Chinese composer Xiao-Song Qu. Old Master sings in a deep, melodious, and powerful voice as he entertains amazed villagers by firelight. Nearing the end of his life, he continues to play his strings earnestly to reach his goal. His songs have the power to stop warring groups and turn them toward peace (Old Master is much needed today in the Middle East).The striking visual power of the film is balanced by fine characterizations and the relationship between Shitou and Lanxiu has remarkable innocence and chemistry though I was unclear about why their relationship ended the way it did.Both Old Master and Shitou question their blindness. Throughout their journey, the master questions whether it was worth sixty years of waiting to be able to see. "Is the world I'm going to see, the same as the world inside of me? "Is it worth it", he asks himself. And he answers, "It is not worth itÂ It is worth it".Both are reconciled to their fate in a final luminous scene of acceptance. After a conversation with the God of Death, Old Master sings to assembled villages under the firelight, "One day", he sings, "all of us will sing, no more sadness, no more tears. We will all lift our voices and sing for joy". For me, this is one of the most uplifting moments in all of cinema.Watching Life on a String is like bathing in sunlight. I felt such a tremendous sense of calm and longing for the infinite that I ended up watching it three times, mesmerized, with an enhanced spiritual feeling each time. I may not watch any more movies, just keep watching this one each week until I die.The God of Death says that life is a game in which some play better than others.Let the good times roll. 
tt0101440;  When one thinks of the term "enlightenment," as least with regards to cinematic portrayals, the usual images that pop up are robed monks chanting Buddhist sutras or quoting mind-imploding Zen insights. But as any good Buddhist can tell you, the roads to enlightenment are infinite. This particular old master's path to enlightenment involves the snapping of one thousand banjo strings. When the last string is broken, the old man will at last see the truth and be ready to die."Life on the String" is one of the most enjoyable and bittersweet Chinese costume epics I've ever experienced. But to label this somewhat obscure gem as a "costume epic" is a bit of an injustice, given its highly unusual story.A blind old master of the pipa (Chinese banjo) and his blind apprentice wander through the wastes of Western China (Xinjiang), in search of enlightenment and inspiration. Upon settling in an abandoned hovel, the old master eagerly anticipates enlightenment and the sweet release of death, as he is on his 995th string.This film, directed by the acclaimed director of "Farewell, My Concubine," is perhaps one of the most magnificently shot films I've ever encountered. But the most amazing aspect of this film is the music. You KNOW the old master is indeed a master when he plays his banjo.  His melancholy, dreamy melodies give this film a genuine dream-like quality. The English subtitles, which are competently written, can only hint at the sublime Chinese poetry of his lyrics. The old man's music can work magic...a type of magic that the violent world that surrounds him sorely needs.Despite "Life on a String"'s deliberate pace, you will be caught up in the story and its eccentric cast of characters. It's hard not to get lost in the seemingly endless horizons of the Chinese deserts and the hypnotic singing of the old master which swells with a lush symphonic accompaniment when he really needs to exert his magic. I also found myself feeling the old man's mounting excitement at his approaching death/enlightenment, as well as his temptation to sink into despair at this imperfect world's follies.I highly recommend "Life on the String" for when you're in a contemplative, or perhaps "poetic", mood.  For a film which deals with the theme of death, it is a very positive and uplifting work, forgoing the usual gloom and doom aura that often surrounds death. It is a film that cries out for the stillness of the soul so that one may hear a truth that can only be expressed in song.  
tt0101440;  Few films have effected me as this one, a quiet gem that details the long life of a blind musician searching for purpose. He is considered a saint by the local villagers, often wisely singing on the pettiness of their quarrels, and the beauty of life and brotherhood...As in Bergmans' 'Wild Strawberries', the protagonist is at a point in his life where death is around the corner. His one wish is to regain his sight, his hope had been sown by his own dying master. When a set amount of strings are plucked a secret compartment in his instrument will open, the cure inside.The film is beatifully photographed, the acting heartfelt and believable, and the music,the music...Well, the first time I saw this film, it wasn't from the beginning, in fact, I caught the last 10 minutes of it. The old man,singing to a crowd , finally excepting his fate. He muses the love that he felt for the villagers, and the disappointments and joys that came with his life. It was one of the most beautiful segments I had seen in film. I was actually brought to tears...Overall an excellent film, and I'm looking foward to seeing this director's other work.10 out of 10
tt0101440; "Life on a String" (Chinese, 1991): Asian symbols often slip right past this very non-Asian man, but I can say a few things that others might be able to use from their Euro-North American point of view: Imagine German film director Werner Herzog being reincarnated as a Chinese film director. He decides to create a story that has links to both the story of Jesus of Nazareth, and Romeo & Juliet, but remains embedded in the Chinese sensibility of myths, symbols, religion, and morality tales. This is a BEAUTIFUL film with many unexpected momentsÂ but don't expect to work your way through this one all alone, without research, or after one viewing. 
tt0101440;  This movie must be seen in the theaters to be appreciated.  The scenery is breathtaking.  Every frame is like a painting that you can hang on the wall. The songs are memorable.  It is a type of film that makes you appreciate life and all its beauty.  It also shows how blind people can see and appreciate things much more than those who can see. 
tt0101440;  The literal translation is "Singing while Walking".  Compared to Yellow Earth (Huang Tu Di) seven years ago, the director has made a obvious giant stride in the criticism of not-so-favorite part of traditional Chinese culture, which is to blame for the human tragedies in this film.  
tt0101440;  watching this film, i was left with too many unanswered questions at the end of it. the first thing i had to say was "...okkkk". in the end i felt a little unsatisfied. the relationship between lanxiu and shidou could have been developed a little more.maybe i was approaching the film in the wrong manner. coming from the "old well" and "yellow river" perspective, this doesn't seem to hold up as well as some of the other 5th generation director's films. 
tt1821373; The movie is a very decently done remake of Shattered. The acting performances were immensely awesome and the suspense s were mostly edge of the seat stuff. Jayasurya as usual drew audiences onto him. In fact all three actors were phenomenal. Its a shocker. In split-seconds this movie instantly changes from a soft-drama to a razor-sharp thriller is absolute master piece. What attracts is the fact that its unlike most malayalam movies being released these days with unwanted bravery acts and invalid songs with Tamil touch. I would recommend to rather make movies like cocktail and continue the legacy of good stories in malayalam movies.I would definitely recommend this movie and would rate this movie to be some really well done remakes. 
tt1821373; It's another ordinary day in the life of Ravi Abraham (Anoop Menon), successful architect and his wife Parvathy (Samvrutha), until their daughter is kidnapped and a stranger Venkatesh (Jayasurya) threatens to topple everything that they hold dear to. In the course of the next several hours, the couple is assigned a series of daunting tasks which would ruin their very existence.Arun Kumar's directorial debut Cocktail is a malayalam movie which is a scene-by-scene adaptation of Butterfly on a Wheel, a Canadian thriller directed by Mike Barker in 2007. The makers of Cocktail have obviously been a bit too stirred by the Pierce Brosnan starer, and hence do not attempt to make too many diversions from the chill points that the original screenplay had.Overall this movie is a spine chilling experience, the shots are well taken,good back ground score, nice editing, superb dialogs and excellent acting by each actors irrespective of the length of their roles.The best part is that this film is creating a revelation in the malayalam film history , hats off to this real trend setter. 
tt1821373; The movie did well in box office bringing in team of Anoop menon- Jayasurya to the screen. The movie is a rip off from the English movie Butterfly Effect(that every action has a consequence to be paid in the future)starring Pierce brosnan and Gerard Butler. The movie but was a bold attempt to bring in a different theme to the screen. Malayalam movie ends with wife of Jayasurya ending up in coma stage after the shock while English movie ends with Gerard butlers(malayalam Anoop menon) wife leaving him. Also some added scene was Anoop menons character being asked to bring a prostitute from street to their car. Other than that I think no difference. 
tt0116771; Much of the commentary on this board revolves around debating the validity of some comparison to R DOGS made on the DVD cover. Forget about all of that... This film-- er-- home movie is utterly horrendous. How can anyone with a shred of credibility claim this as being 10/10??? There is no plot, none. I couldn't believe that I spent money to rent this (more on that later) and that I had fooled myself into believing that this (based on box cover art and some sort of film fest award blurb) had potential. The only thing I do really remember was that, unbelievably, one of the annoying main characters was supposedly offed with a bullet to the head... and he ends up surviving the wound and making it to the final credits alive. Wow. And looky dere, Killers has a sequel. Double wow.True story -- I actually was in so much denial that I had wasted my money and life force on this rental that I kept the videotape for what must've been six months. I kept telling myself that it never actually happened. The video on top of the TV was an illusion - a mental symbol of my self-loathing. After someone pointed out that is was indeed real and that I needed to get a grip, I decided that I couldn't just leave it there. I thought, "How many others have I denied the suffering of sitting through the viewing of this masterpiece by hoarding Killers all to myself?" I had to do the right thing and return it back to the hell from which it came. So, as I imagine most of the populous of IMDb would do in a similar situation, I mustered up some major courage and drove to the video store... at 2AM. After making sure that no one was around, I got out of my car (still running of course), slipped the movie into the drop box slot, and booked the hell out of there never to return.I guess I expected that some goons from Hollywood Video corporate would come looking for me (the bill must've racked up to something like $1,238.67 by that time) so I moved away from the area. However, coincidently, much like the Killers storyline, nothing ever happened. 
tt0116771;  After seeing this film, I am convinced that the people who added positive feedback about this movie are either:a) grateful to come out of their cave and see daylight, much less ever see an actual good movie...b) a storeowner who bought several copies of this video and are trying to rid themselves of them or...c) actual members of the production crew on this movie.The movie was so bad, I had to check the box to make sure this wasn't still in production. The only redeeming quality was the 3 second intro. The dialogue was horrible. Maybe it just seemed bad coming from the either whiny or monotone voices coming from the actors. This is to cinema what SAVED BY THE BELL is to intelligent comedy. Garbage. 
tt0116771;  An embarrassing piece of cinematic incompetence. I've heard more compelling dialogue in laundry detergent commercials and seen better acting in Mentos ads. At no time during this reel of tripe was there even the most vague hint of suspense, character development or unpredictable sequence of events. This was a completely sophomoric attempt at film making and the result was a film with absolutely no redeeming qualities.Ishtar beware! ! ! ! 
tt0116771;  I have a rule when it comes to renting straight-to-video films and it's very simple: I don't rent anything that has cover that is a rip-off of the movie Swingers, I don't rent anything that has a cover of some hacky actor holding a gun (Judge Rienhold, John Stamos, etc.), and I don't rent any film that has the quote "If you like Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs, you'll love this." The latter applied to this film.  So why did I rent it? I don't know.  I'm still knocking myself in the head for it.  I should be fined or something.This film has everything bad that there can be bad in a movie. It's got really bad acting, a script that will having cringing, laced with just plain stupid dialog ("You idiot.snapping is hurt, pointing means kill.") and direction that completely takes away from the film.  Whereas someone like Martin Scorsese uses the camera like a paintbrush on a canvas, this director uses the camera like fingers on a chalk board.  There are numerous quick cuts and rapid repeating shots that do nothing than remind the viewer that they are watching a bad movie.  These little tactics aren't clever, they're not artsy and they do nothing to enhance the movie.  They are simply annoying.A group of thugs, who look more like a crappy rock band than they do drug dealers, meet at a warehouse to score a drug deal.   Another group of thugs come to the warehouse to apparently get the drugs the first crappy group has and to kill them off.  By the time this happens, the movie is so unbearable, you spend most of your time fast forwarding.  There isn't an actor in the bunch and the worst one of all, is the cliched pony tail tough guy with the constant scowl on his face.  This guy is supposed to be the "mean" thug with no conscious, the consummate killer. The only thing this guy killed in a believable manner, was my will to finish watching this stupid film.I'd like to say there was something good, like cinematography or sets, or something, but I can't find a single positive thing to say about this trash. Even the DVD itself was awful.  If anyone can tell me how to manoeuver through their confusing menu, I'd appreciate it.  I actually wasted ten, fifteen minutes trying to pick up where I left off in the film, while going to eat (or puke maybe) and the menu was put together so poorly, it makes me hate this film more.  I can only hope that everyone involved with this garbage never, ever, ever works on any film ever again. Not as an actor or writer, not a the food delivery person, not as a video store clerk! They should all be banned.  
tt0116771; ...but you can see it from here.I definitely don't understand why anyone would recommend this movie. Not a bit of plot, not suspenseful, not well-made. No point to having made it, really.Completely forgettable in ever way. 
tt0116771; So, 428 IMDb people rate it 1.9, so... I just have to see it and make my own judgement. I've given it a 5! Which is much higher than some very well known films I've seen.For starters, Killers has a plausible story that I can follow without scratching my head too much, so that's a plus. There's this bunch of low-level misfits who go to an abandoned warehouse to buy drugs from a guy who has stolen them from another bunch of mid-level misfits.Unfortunately, the latter know what's going on and come along to reclaim their property. The warehouse has lots of floors and lots of rooms. The two parties meet, there is lots of shooting, most of which misses - as usual.The actors are quite good, Kim Little is in the first group, said to have just come along to get high, and on the other side is Scott Carson, a handsome, spoilt brat pretending to be a real hood.There are no serious flaws in my view, but it is all a bit predictable and all that shooting does get tedious 
tt0116771; The first movies from The Asylum and an example of a company that debuts with a terrible movie and carry on making countless others that are even worse. Killers I really do have to agree was a disaster on all levels. Well...maybe not quite all, Kim Little was not too bad, actually she gives a very impassioned performance, though she was much better in the sequel(which while not great was a significant improvement over this). And you can't help shake off that feeling that she was too good-seeming for someone so low. But her performance isn't enough, and that is mainly because the rest of the acting is so bad, more a case though of people trying too hard rather than non-tryers, especially from Paul Logan who makes his clichA©d role even more so with a permanent scowl on his face, I wasn't sure whether it was because he was trying too hard to be villainous or whether it was because he didn't want to be there in the first place. A lot of things don't help the actors though, their characters are stereotypical, blandly developed and even annoying(Erica Ortega's character does come out as over-the-top), and the dialogue is vomit-inducingly inane. The story did have an underwritten and over-simplistic scenario to begin with, but does nothing to do something with it. It was too dull, predictable and completely lacking in suspense, and further spoilt by direction lacking in tautness and some of the most irritating camera work(enough with the rapid camera shots already) and lighting schemes of any movie I've encountered. All in all, apart from Kim Little Killers is a disaster. 1/10 Bethany Cox 
tt0116771;  This film is an embarrassment. Nothing works on any level. The direction, screenplay, acting , and editing work together to repel  your eyes from the screen. Everything is inappropriate and incoherent. At first you can sit there with and groan, wince, and laugh at it, but very shortly the whole effort of watching just becomes too ponderous.  
tt0116771;       .......awful, base, beastly, blameworthy, corrupt... I could go on to use every single obscure adjective in the dictionary to describe how bad this movie really is, but i can`t be bothered! I usually only comment on movies i like, but i couldn`t resist having a pop at this pathetic effort. Where can i start, the direction was awful, the acting was ........ahh what is the point. DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE, YOU WILL FEEL BAD IF YOU WASTE 2 HOURS OF YOUR LIFE ON IT. At least now i know not to rent a movie just because it has a cool reference and intriguing back cover ! -3 out of 10. 
tt0116771; This film is so bad, so deprived of any structure,or redeeming quality of sort, so uncannily aware or unaware, mostly, uninterested, i believe, of showing any visible filmmaking training, or just, even some simple education,for that matter,so demented, and, so badly shot, so poorly acted by people, whose non acting abilities,or whose faces are so lacking in any department of even frugal,passable modeling material, it would be almost impossible to find any worse, just even through a very accurately long lasting casting search, that all together, the whole thing comes out truly so depressing, and, demeaning, you may wanna give up on movies for a while, or, if you were just a little familiar with the Industry, you could only guess, such atrocity could have been made only by "that David Michael Latt", who has become these days (and, believe it or not, everything is still obviously possible,in this Country!) one of the "moguls" of a terrible,and, utterly detrimental, annoying, poisonous, little studio, that's making, supposedly, a picture every month, and, it is called "Asylum"! Oh well! lol But, what's even worse news than all the above mentioned, it is that the Asylum got itself a DEAL with the Sy/Fy Channel! And,that most of their films are even distributed largely everywhere, all over the World,in DVD! Now,after watching "something" so unbearably bad, such as "Killers", you may even be able to understand, why, lately, those Sy/Fy movies have been all so intolerably bad, some real stinkers, that are irritating a half of this Country, but, that are yet still getting made, and, not only for cheap, but, also, normally shot in a few rushed days, by crews resembling more a little group of juvenile students in shorts, coming from some suburban Film School, than even the most crude, smallest,independent pedestrian crew, of any other B grade Genre movie, where, at least, some semi qualified and passionate individuals would be at least trying to get ahead in the business,instead of messing up almost with some sadistic pleasure! And,shall we bother to mention,as well,that, here at "the Asylum",they normally use some "incredible" sets, such as hidden few woods,just out of the sight of the LAPD's police jurisdiction,so that the producers can even pocket the budget originally planned for shooting permits, and,then, for interiors,they move in, as a treat, in some of those untidy kitchens,in the apartment of one of those vapid PA's,they hire for way below scale, while,all the rest of the assembled,often, senseless footage, is edited in, with lots of other B rolls, or stuff shot (very, very badly)on a blue/green screen, and, helped with guts to look OK(since, at least, they've got to eventually put together some vaguely promising trailer) by some OK(when you're lucky..that is!)CGI work, normally virtually enhanced by a cheesy, bloated to levels of unconventional,and, previously unheard stupidity, music score, unintentionally laughable, wildly inappropriate,and, most of the times, recycled(obviously) from some "Gaudi" piece from a Studio film's library's left over,either robbed,or bargained down for a few bucks, and, a couple of "promised" favors. Now, if this is a winning recipe, they might have - and,this is a must say, too!- achieved,for the very first time in History,ever, the financially remunerative creation of the first D grade movie Studio,able to get away with murder(truly, of what "murder",you may now ask? But, "the murder" of the real movies,of course! That's what I'm talking about, and, yes, even of the D grade ones!),since, without any style or ambition, class or preparation, nor passion for,at least, some of the most mercenary cult elements, ever abused, but, just actually by using a series of basic standard, fraudulent short cuts in very bad filmmaking (if of that we can even still talk!) that, even people like Lloyd Kaufman of Troma's, would find way too plain, and,just a tad too clichA©,to be at the end, even merely interesting, to bother in the making of a Z grade picture, out of each one of them! Yet,people keep on buying this crap,and,getting robbed,because of robbery, we are talking about,while,at the end of 'such presentations",they'd be discussing the end of what once was called the Golden Era of Hollywood, when, even D grade pictures had, at least, some dignity, and, if Corman was just a genius, at times, experimenting on a few LSD's bad trips,but, then producing little masterpieces,even someone clearly demented and disturbed,such as Ed Wood, had, at the very end of the day, a true mythical aura,next to all this! Just let me tell you, even a poor commercial for some of the cheesiest club in Reno,Nevada, could be easily Academy Award's material, by comparison to this Bologna, and, even with some right, and, appropriate argumentation's! That being said... 
tt0800135; Laurent Herbiet's near-perfect film plays out like a post-mortem murder mystery, but perhaps its most engaging moments are spent in the past - filmed in gritty, black and white, evoking newsreel footage from the Algerian War of the late 50s. It is a stunning first film, which manages to both incorporate and shrug off the influence of producers the Dardenne brothers and politically-minded filmmaker Costa-Gavras. This is clearly Herbiet's show, and his confidence with the camera is highly evident here.As co-writer and producer Costa-Gavras mentioned in his preamble at the 2006 Toronto Int'l Film Festival, this film is less about history than a metaphor for the present. One sees frightening parallels to the recent wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Lebanon. Olivier Gourmet gives a riveting performance as the morally flexible titular character, and Robinson StA©venin is convincingly sympathetic as the conflicted apprentice and unwilling accomplice Lt. Rossi. It's worth seeing, despite a lackluster framing device that betrays the immediacy of scenes set in the past. 
tt0800135; When the extreme rightist retired with amnesty Colonel Raoul Duplan (Olivier Gourmet) is deadly shot in his house, Detective Phillipe from the police department investigates the case. Lieutenant Galois (CA©cile De France) is assigned by the high command of the army to follow the investigations of the murder and prepare reports with her findings. Without any lead, she receives some pages of the diary of Lieutenant Guy Rossi (Robinson StA©venin) with a message telling that the colonel died in Saint Arnaud. Lieutenant Galois reads the pages and discovers that Rossi was a just-graduated lawyer with a broken heart because his girlfriend Isabelle left him that volunteered to the French army in 1955 and served under the command of the colonel in Algeria. Every day, the curious Galois receives a correspondence with the sequel of the diary disclosing details of the relationship of Rossi with the colonel until she discloses the identity and the motives of the killer."Mon Colonel" is an unknown gem that deserves to be discovered by lovers of cinema and history. The fictitious story shows unscrupulous details of the Algerian War of Independence (1954-1962), with torture, guerrilla, terrorism, the cynical campaign of "pacification" of the French Army and other cruelties through the eyes of a rookie, clumsy and naive lieutenant. The screenplay, written by the great Costa-Gravas, is one of the most intelligent that I have recently seen, disclosing the story in the 50's in pieces, leaving the viewer anxious for the sequence, entwined with the investigation of a murder. The stylish direction of Laurent Herbiet could not be better, alternating colors with the black and white of the period of war in an awesome cinematography. Olivier Gourmet is impressive in the role of the tough colonel, Robinson StA©venin is perfect in the role of a man that loses his innocence, CA©cile De France extremely beautiful giving a touch of feeling to the story and the cameo of Charles Aznavour closing the plot with golden key. There is also a criticism to the amnesty given to torturers like Colonel Raoul Duplan (and many members of the military dictatorships in South America in the 70's and 80's). Last but not the least, the situation of the poor oppressed people in Algeria in the 50's is not different from the present situations of Iraq and Afghanistan. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "Meu Coronel" ("My Colonel") 
tt0800135; I attended the World Premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival.Incredibly shot, marvelous acting and a story that will make you think strongly not only about the situation then but of the situation in our current day world. Costa-Gavras' script (co-written with Jean-Claude Grumberg) is tight and stimulating.I really hope to see this movie in theatres soon for every one to enjoy.Terrific final cameo with Aznavour!Congratulations guys. 
tt0800135; French movies about the "Events", as France called the independence war of Algeria from 1954 to 1962, are not so numerous. This one is clever, well shot (except for the framing) and wonderfully played. Olivier Gourmet is definitely one of my favorites french-speaking actors. First of all, I was cautious about the so many times used trick leading into depicting a past story from a present day perspective. It is very often a fake process intended to draw tears. I do prefer complete past stories, which also make us think about present day's similarities. I am impressed to read on this comments board the comparison made by people from everywhere with Iraq and Afghanistan. Reason Vs. emotion. But this movie is not so badly made regarding this trick. It is also a reflexion about amnesty of war criminals, the relevance of military justice and the constant hypocrisy of french people about Algeria. I regret a bit the part consisting in telling a past story from the reading of a journal written by a young officer, but Cecile de France is so lovely and she is doing well. The telling of the past story analyzes quite well also the differences of views between the army (coming from metropolitan France)and the colonial white community in Algeria. It makes me think that this war could also have resulted in an independence war in a South African or American way, setting-up the colonials free from their homeland, and leading to a segregationist state. There is a lot to think of in this movie. I am surprised that this movie had not been echoed so much. It reminded me of "Honneur d'un capitaine" (the honor of a captain), movie shot by Pierre Schoendoerffer in 1982, also telling about torture. 
tt0800135; The French film, Mon Colonel, is ostensibly about the Algerian war for independence from France in the 1950s, but it has obvious, and apparently intentional, relevance to present-day conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. The film is presented as a murder mystery: a color, present-day story concerning the murder of a retired colonel, wrapped around a black-and-white version of the events, years ago in Algeria, that motivated his killer. The story is gradually revealed in excerpts from a diary that are delivered to the police and the military. The diary is that of a young law student who volunteers for the army in Algeria and is assigned to assist the colonel in charge of a large town there.The framing device is a bit clumsy, but it does serve to bring the story into the present, the better for us to consider its implications. This is not done in too obvious a way: Iraq and Afghanistan are never mentioned. But we certainly get the point. We'd probably suspect something like this anyway, from the fact that the script is by Costa-Gavras, long a politically-engaged director with a leftist viewpoint, who is probably most famous for his film Z (1969), about the military junta in Greece.In particular, the Colonel has definite ideas on the uses of torture. It is to be used to extract information that could save the lives of French citizens or defeat the insurgents. It is not to be covered up, or called something else: the Colonel scandalizes visiting French dignitaries by telling them exactly how the "pacification" of his town has been achieved. And very importantly, one must dislike torture, and must not enjoy inflicting it on people. It is to be used only for serious purpose, and not to humiliate people unnecessarily. It is to be used in the service of "justice", if not necessarily "legality."The Colonel's young protA©gA© is a law student. First he is assigned to finding a legal justification for the Colonel's methods. Because of emergency laws that have been enacted, he succeeds in preparing a plausible case. Pleased with his work, the Colonel then puts him in charge of the torture. The young man has great difficulty with this assignment. Eventually he refuses to carry out his orders, and disappears under mysterious circumstances.The background for the situation is carefully shown. The French have been in Algeria for 125 years and consider it part of France. Many Algerian Arabs consider themselves to be French and some have fought for France. On the other hand France resists giving them the vote, fearing, as one senator remarks, that the parliament in Paris would be "turned into a bazaar." The towns all have signs on their outskirts proclaiming that they are French, but most of the countryside belongs to the insurgents. There is a great scene where almost the entire French (i.e. non-Arab) population of a town is driven out to the countryside, with visiting dignitaries from France, for a picnic. When the young student asks his Colonel whether this is safe, he is told that the area has been scoured for rebels for weeks, and the whole area is full of soldiers. There is even a tame Arab chieftain making a show of welcome. Obviously this is not the sort of outing the townspeople would undertake on their own.There is no doubt that the filmmakers are opposed to the Colonel and all he stands for. Even so, they give him plenty of opportunity to explain himself and try to justify his actions. The rebels are committing terror attacks against civilians, the supposedly loyal Arabs are paying off the rebels, there are spies in their midst (a friend of the young officer turns out to be one of them.) And the techniques of the Colonel, including torture and summary executions, seem to be working --- the town is "pacified." As the Colonel points out, in an insurgency, whichever side is supported by the people will win. (The Colonel is not naive in the matter of guerrilla war, he even has quotes from Mao posted on his walls to remind him how the insurgents think.) The Colonel's job is to make sure the people support him, through fear if necessary, and, temporarily at least, he succeeds.Of course we are intended to relate this film to current events in the Mideast, Abu Graib and so on. But I found it more interesting on two other levels, one, the historical, and two, as a more abstract meditation on human conduct. It made me realize that in spite of seeing the film Battle of Algiers many years ago, and reading Camus in college (his name turns up in the film, the Colonel thinks he's a traitor), I know very little of the history of the French in Algeria. I should learn more. As for the more abstract arguments, they hang in the air. What do you do about terrorism, if not to fight it by any means necessary? We know what the French did: eventually, they left. They could do that because Algeria, whatever they claimed, was never really part of France. Questions hang in the air, like an argument that has only begun.It's a good movie, believable, thought-provoking. It probably opens some old wounds in France, which would mostly, it seems, like to forget about Algeria. There is nothing minimalist about this film. It is full of the sense that thoughts, motives, actions matter, that we are responsible for our actions and had better consider them carefully. Definitely worth seeing. 
tt0800135; Superb, gripping take on France's Algeria quagmire.Not writing a review as such, just keen to share some thoughts.Spoiler Alert: The Iraq comparison hits you in the face early on. And from a western point of view Iraq is THE telling comparison.America's occupation post Saddam ouster is much more in keeping with the tone of the Algerian experience. Afghanistan, as wars go, is a more just one - fought in response to an international act of mass murder.The Colonel, although made essentially toxic by his long exposure to war, is waging, with the apparent blessing of the French military hierarchy, a campaign to bust up an insurgency and seems to have succeeded.He's displaying the whatever it takes mentality to win, isn't he?. I'm sure it wasn't only the Gestapo who practiced torture in WW11.I'm NOT saying this is right, but the film, at least for me, begs the question - is it necessarily wrong as part of an overall war-fighting/winning strategy - especially if it will save lives.The ultra naive young Lt bothered me. Completely unfit for military service, psychologically and physically.Clearly, I know he shouldn't have been in the army, let alone Algeria - joining up because of a broken heart.Spoiler Alert/s: But I was repulsed by his cowardice when he finally made it into combat but couldn't even bring himself to use his gun to save the life of a French comrade.In fact he didn't fire a single shot during the village skirmish, preferring to cower behind a stone wall, as those about him blast away at the insurgents. And HE is the one who opens the Colonel's mind to his process of bloody realpolitik, but doesn't see it until his musings about summary execution become a gut churning reality.As an earlier contributor wrote, I agree this film is more interesting for the historical/human conduct questions it raises rather than the obvious Oh-My-God! this is just like the Americans in Iraq thing!.."The Colonel", much like his job in the film, truly toys with your mind. 
tt0800135; This is a well made and relevant film that explores the moral, ethical and legal implications of war against an insurgency. Rossi, a young French soldier who is a lawyer in training enlists into the Army and goes to Algeria where the French were trying to pacify Algeria 40 years ago. Rossi's experiences with his Colonel and the methods used by the Colonel against the insurgency puts Rossi in an impossible situation. The story alternates between the war and present day where a murder investigation is under way and a mysterious diary of Rossi is being mailed anonymously in pieces by someone and read by a sympathetic and riveted female soldier who is investigating the murder that seems to be related to Rossi's diary and the events described within. 
tt1930423; I would recommend everyone to buy a DVD of this film... If you are in a very bad mood then just turn on your DVD player and watch this.. You will wonder why people call spider man, batman or superman a super hero? They are nothing compared to NO1SK!! You will feel very confident about yourself..You'll think if he could become NO1SK then i can be Root over minus 1 (What ever your name is) so easily!! It's such an inspiring movie..it will move you surely (you cant watch it without moving actually..you'll fell off chair laughing).. Acting and Direction were possibly worst.. Story cant be weaker than this.. But all these things make this an epic entertaining movie!! A must see (dramatic/romantic/action) comedy!! 
tt1930423; I went to the Rajmoni cinema a few months ago along with some of my friends with surging expectations and in the end it fulfilled it.The film was a pure laughter marathon.Now technically the film was not immaculate but still you can laugh at the silliest mistakes the director made.The shooting was done mostly in Bangkok and this film is said to be one of the biggest budget Bangladeshi film ever made. As predicted it turned out to be one of the biggest hit of all-time.The story starts with the heroine Apu Biswas . She supposedly lives in Bangkok but studies in a Degree college which indicates a bit of carelessness from the part of the director and story writer.Her father Ali Raj is a henpecked husband of dominating Nuton.In her industry the workers protested for their rights and to stop their protest she decided to assassinate their leader.The moment he was going to be executed the hero Shakib Khan came into action and saved his life fighting against millions of villains.From there on the story became the age old family crisis saga where Shakib Khan enters the heroine's house in disguise,makes her fall in love and suddenly came to know how his parents were killed.Apart from the typical storyline the movie was quite entertaining especially for those who are not expecting some award-winning piece of art.Keep everything out of your head when you enter the cinema and there is absolutely no way you can hate this.finally,YOU SHOULD NOT MISS THIS EPIC !!! 
tt1930423; Despite the movie kicking off in a rather ordinary traditional fashion, focusing on a young man moving in and out of heart breaking struggles to support himself, it eventually does take a lot of twists to make the storyline very unique. Although it was a surprise to find such a flamboyant plot in a supposedly ordinary Bangladeshi movie,I was not surprised at all by the outstanding performance by Shakib Khan who totally nailed it with his breath taking performance.Very few movies these days are able to provide such a monstrous level of humorous appetite alongside such breathtaking action along with special effects,so to sum it all up,Yet another success under the championship belt of SHAKIB KHAN !! 
tt0782839; This horror movie is a sort of agoraphobic psychological thriller. The story is simple, but has an interesting "big" twist and some good elements. It is however not quite enough to have you riveted the whole way through, as even with its short running time, the movie is quite slow-paced and some story elements are less interesting although they are mostly necessary as one understands once the twist is revealed... On the other hand, it does allow for good acting by the two female leads, good camera-work and genuine scary moments.A neat, sly, little story that could have benefited from a little be more complexity, but that still works as a brainteaser and for the atmosphere and scare factor. 
tt0782839; It's incredible the level of art of this picture, including photography, art design, direction and VFX.This is one of the first films in Spanish which brings together all these fabulous value - added items, as a great art concept, really good VFX and a great score.Aditionally, it has a tremendous script, which turns around sinister and usual fears of humans, specially in our modern times.It's also one of the first movies in Latinamerica and Spain which is going to be produced as remake. The actors are at a top level, specially the performances of NoA«lle Schonwald and Julieth Restrepo. 
tt0782839; I went to see this movie with high expectations, mainly because a Horror movie made in Colombia is something you can't watch everyday. What i've found was a very good color quality, good use of sound but a quite poor story, a Colombian remake of "A tale of two sisters".I really enjoy Colombian films, mostly because they're original, and our filmmakers don't use to repeat a story... every story has a different spark. But honestly and sincerely, this movie sounded like "Hey, we're Colombian filmmakers, we also know how to make a long-black-haired lady coming out wet from a bath tube and with an erratic way of moving" ... so commercial, so American-remake ... in other words: "Roy Lee, this is your movie, we've made this for you" I'm sure Kidman could be nuts if she really wants to participate in a remake of this movie... this is not gonna work, i'm sure. 
tt0782839; Is nice to watch a Colombian movie that is not about drug dealers, the paramilitary conflict or hit men. Even though the movie is not scary as many other i've watched it's really entertained and it keeps you wondering what's going on all the time.This movie also shows that there's no need to have a lot of character to make a great film.I haven't watched the Mexican version of this movie yet, but I heard that is not as good as the Colombian one. Can't wait to watch the Hollywood version, which by the way was announce a long time ago but we still don't have it. 
tt0782839; "At the End of the Spectra" is a better than expected though flawed ghost film.**SPOILERS**Going out to the countryside, Vega, (Noelle Schonwald) arrives at an isolated apartment building and hopes the trip will help her deal with her newly-found sense of paranoia, as she finds the solitude encouraging. Exploring the place, she begins to grow more acclimated to it, which doesn't sit well with her father, (Kepa Amuchastegui) who doesn't like her being alone. After a few more days being alone, she starts to think that someone is in the apartment with her, and learns from neighbor TulipA!n, (Julieth Restrepo) about a former resident who spent years in a mental hospital recovering from a deadly disease before dying. Convinced that is the ghost which has been haunting the place, she tries to find a way of helping to get rid of it before it does her and others harm.The Good News: There was some good stuff here at times. One of the best features is that, even though the film isn't the fastest moving film around, it's still actually a benefit to the film during this time. Even though it's not really featuring any ghost action at all, which doesn't come until the second half, and is in bits and spurts during that point anyway, leaving only a couple of scenes that are actually somewhat interesting in most senses, yet this one doesn't really have that much of a bad sense about it, letting it's early parts breathe quite easily and it makes it somewhat easy to get into, even though those looking for a fast-moving film won't be too impressed. Another good part is the aforementioned ghost attacks in the second half, which are quite fun. There's a couple of really good scenes shown on a closed-circuit TV, including a really good one while she's sleeping that plays just as well as anything coming out of Asia at the moment, the shots out into the hallway that reveal what a peephole doesn't is actually quite impressive, and there's a couple more fun scenes that show-up later on to make it seem quite fun and enjoyable. There's even two big, high-profile attack scenes inside a bathtub, of all places, that manages to score quite highly with some thrilling action and a fun outcome each time, as well as being the only time throughout the film any blood is shown, making them all the better due to that fact. The last plus is the fact that, as well as all these scenes, the final encounter in here is just a lot of fun and manages to be one of the best features. These here are the film's good points.The Bad News: There was a couple of flaws in this one. One of the biggest is a point mentioned earlier, that the film doesn't move at all that fast despite being so short. This one feels much longer than it really is, as the beginning of this one is so hard to get into. There's no excitement in these scenes at all, they just drag on and on and on due to it being almost the exact same thing being repeated where she gets into her surroundings and starts to freak out over something before looking around and seeing nothing. That is pretty much the extent of the first half of the film, punctuated by appearances from one or two people through a peephole, but even those moments are kept at a minimum due to it going right back to previous events. This just makes the film such a chore at times, and while it actually manages to stay on topic and not get bogged down in useless subplots, the effect is not a fast-moving film in any way. The only other real problem here is the fact that the film is really quite confusing during the end, where, through a combination of chaotic camera-work, near-absence of dialog and a cramped location, it's impossible to tell what exactly has happened. Nothing is really explained, just it showcases a succession of activity without really doing anything to say what it meant or what officially happened, as the whole thing transpires without us knowing what's happening, and it makes for a disjointed effort at times. These here are all that's really wrong with it.The Final Verdict: While not perfect in any event, this one still has enough good points to make it a viable, if unnecessary entry. Really only recommended to those who enjoy the slower-burning horror entries or are a ghost-film completist, while those not too fond of those or aren't impressed should heed caution.Rated R: Violence and some Language 
tt0782839; If you have another guerrilla, narc-traffic, "sicario" script ready to shoot, way to go, man!!! Those are the kind of movies Colombia needs to change our reality.I didn't know every writer, singer, painter, sculptor, reporter or filmmaker in Colombia had to write, sing, paint, sculpt, report or shoot only our problems not to be called infamous or indifferent.Good luck with your movies about our "hurt nation" and good luck to those whose movies distract us and entertain us to avoid that reality just for a couple of hours. I'm not indifferent or infamous just because of that, I love my country and it hurts like hell everything that happens here, whether a movie shows me or not how overwhelming our reality can be.You are another one of that disrespectful Colombian pseudo-artist who don't allow our reality to change by not showing just a little bit of respect for somebody else's expression of art. 
tt0782839; After a highly traumatic event,due to which she becomes the victim of extreme agoraphobia Vega is forced to spend some time far away from work.By her father's recommendation, she decides to move to a new apartment,where she begins living as a hermit,abruptly changing her lifestyle.She begins having strange visions with no explanations and hearing voices she can't ignore."Al Final del Espectro" was released on DVD in Poland few days ago,so I had to pick it up.It's surely influenced by Japanese modern ghost movies like "Ringu" or "Dark Water"-on the other hand there is plenty of claustrophobic atmosphere as Vega is terrified to leave her home,yet equally scared to stay and face her unknown tormentor.The acting is great,the camera work is splendid and the climax offers a nice twist.Nicole Kidman will be co-producing and acting as Vega in the American remake that will be directed by Juan Felipe Orozco himself. 
tt0782839; I went to see this movie with high hopes of finding an interesting and original plot and was nothing but disappointed. Edition and sound effects are OK, but the plot loses momentum after the first 30 minutes and then the story goes downhill, with a really bad twist. In sum, the movie blends The Grudge, The Ring and The Others in a dreadful way that leaves some of the characters' roles hanging without conclusion. It is, nonetheless, a good attempt of presenting a film proposal other than the typical drug-related story in Colombia. The director was very resourceful and took good care of color grading and light. Noelle Schonwald is a promising actress and Kepa Amuchastegui proved why he is so respected in Colombia. 
tt0782839; This Colombian-made thriller may not win any prizes for originality, but what it does, it does well. Effectively blending elements lifted from Repulsion and countless J-horror films, Al Final del Espectro stars the marvelous Noelle Schonwald as Vega, a filmmaker trying to recover from the shock of seeing her boyfriend almost killed on the job. Her father sets her up in a dank apartment, where she installs several closed circuit cameras to bring order and safety to her world. Of course, the effect of the cameras is the exact opposite of what she intends, and strange and spooky events begin to unfold on the grainy VCR footage. Schonwald's performance reminded me of early Christina Ricci, physically, she looks like an adult version of little Kyra Schon, the terrifying child zombie from the original Night of the Living Dead. This is an extremely claustrophobic thriller that works magnificently until the third act revelations, which unfortunately leech much of the mystery and horror out of the film--a mistake not made by Polanski in Repulsion. Still and all, this is an above average chiller from a country not usually associated with the genre. 
tt0782839; When I heard that Colombia would make a horror movie, at last, I felt like a little boy waiting for a candy, I'd seen how some countries from the distant east have increased their interesting for horror films, for instance, the grudge or the eye filled my expectations, they were really scary movies, but this one failed at the time of supporting the plot alive during the whole movie, sometimes I fell asleep, thought it had some scaring-peaks. I liked Noelle acting, she was one of the good things that had this movie.I think that "al final del espectro" was a good attempt, but it couldn't let the typical slowness that it has characterized the Colombian cinema. 
tt1834824; Shadows and Faces is the first and only film I watched depicting the ethnic conflict between Cypriot Greeks and Cypriot Turks in 1963. I must say it was a little different from what we had been told and taught. I liked the film for lots of reasons but one of the most important reasons was how they handled this delicate issue with a relatively objective manner and without much nationalist propaganda. The title is perfect for the film implying some people seeing ever-growing dark shadows of other people instead of seeing them as they really are. The shadow puppets and puppeteers are also perfect metaphors artistically used in the film. The very shadow play called "Karagoz / Karagiozis" is a great choice as well since it exists both in Turkish and Greek culture. As for acting, I especially liked Hazar Erguclu's Ruhsar character and Popi Avraam's Anna character. You could relate to many people in the film and character development during changing situations was worth watching. I recommend this film to everyone interested in the changeable human nature. 
tt1834824; The blurb tells the depicted period ends in 1963 and I was a little disappointed because "Operation Atilla" 1974 which led to the tragic split of Cyprus is more interesting. If this film is a meal, I am just half full.History and politics may be the mainstay, the more interesting is the responses of the villagers. They are reflections of human vulnerability under fear or threat. Both Greek and Turk Cypriots are actually living in perfect harmony: they eat, they date, they mate on the same island without any conflicts. After a politically unstable inkling emerges, the old (Anna, Veli) are imperturbable while the young impulsive, impatient.Veli may appear to be naAve, indecisive, weak in fighting against the ruthless Greeks. Nevertheless, he has faith in people, just like Anna, she believes her neighbours, her friends' goodness. They are both for peace and that's the true nature of the Cypriots.On the contrary, the inexperienced young hearts are easily incited. Ahmet voluntarily spies on the neighbours even though his mom keeps reminding him to be calm. His wish of displaying gallantry directly causes the death of an innocent Turk shepherd. The bullet from his uncle's pistol crosses the Rubicon, making the fissure even more irreparable.If I were Ruhsar, I of course would also feel impatient in that uncertain situation. Her wish is pure and direct: getting back the lost father. And, with the divine blessings, the daughter-father reunion at the end is sweet. Yet, when looking back in the later day, she may/might find it unnecessary to sacrifice so many innocent lives for that.Sinister lull with boiling agitation in the surroundings is a perfect culprit for the wake-up/birth of impatience which leads to a irremediably wrong step. Always, always, patience and sound judgment are products of time and heart. 
tt1834824; I caught Golgeler ve Suretler (Shadows And Faces)at the Istanbul film festival a few days ago. I have enjoyed several films by the director Dervis Zaim. In short: On the human level Golgeler ve Suretler is a passable drama, but ultimately flawed by by falling back into Turkish nationalist myths about events on Cyprus.The film is set in 1963, which is one of several point of violence in the history of Cyprus. As background, at this time Cyprus was just independent and there were complex negotiations to establish a government given the 80% Greek and 17% Turkish populations and Greece's and Turkey's own interests.The film, as a human drama focuses on the inter-communal tensions, but as a result audiences miss the fact that the real tensions on Cyprus derived directly and almost entirely from factors outside of Cyprus, specifically in Athens and Ankara. Audiences will not appreciate a key and very important aspect of Cyprus, which is precisely that the ethnic Greek and Turks there in fact lived extremely well together in highly peaceful and tolerant atmosphere.We know now that the first mosques blown up in 62-63 were blown up by Turkish security personnel from the mainland under orders from our Army then ruling Turkey in all but name.* Several Turkish Cypriot leaders (those advocating a untied Republic) were assassinated by the same Turkish forces. These atrocities were falsely blamed on the Greeks, setting off violent reprisals against Greek civilians, destruction of Churches, which in turn then set off bigger reprisals by Greeks.As most who know the history of Cyprus know, ultimately, in the mid-1970's, the Greek government in Athens, then a US-backed military dictatorship attempted a full takeover of Cyprus, resisted actually by the Greek Cypriots, but nonetheless triggered a full scale invasion by Ankara's generals, which catastrophised the entire country, including the Turkish Cypriots Ankara was claiming to "protect." There is another problem, at the level of dramatic portrayal. The characters are more than unbalanced. EG Greek Cypriot characters in the film are run the range of good to totally evil, and Turkish Cypriot characters run from the good to the good.I think the acting by Hazar Erguclu (Rushar) is particularly good. And that character of the young daughter is quite well fleshed out. Many of the other characters though are caricatures, quite frankly as thin as the two dimensional shadow puppets one of the lead characters works with. For example Uncle Veli, who is a Turkish Cypriot town leader, who has a good relationship with the Greek Cypriots, is portrayed as hopelessly naive. The character of young hot headed Turk-hating Greek "Thanassi" is an absurdly shallow lumping of every stereotype in Turkey against Greeks.In Turkey we are just barely climbing out of the pervasive ultra-nationalist and xenophobic haze of the past 90 years. In this nationalist narrative all our neighbors and our own minorities past and present are all enemies and traitors. One would have thought we had reached a point in Turkey were a more truthful and balanced film could be made. Dervis Ziam film at times moves one baby step in that direction, but overall falls back to repeating myths.Lastly, I am very interested in this period as while I am from mainland Turkey, my wife is Turkish Cypriot and the stories she tells are utterly different than the narrative I was educated in. She tells of cooperation, friendship, integration and respect between Turks and Greeks on Cyprus. She tells of her people then and now wanting a a single Cyprus not under Greece or Turkey. That is the real voice of these beleaguered people.I look forward when our directors can be a bit more courageous about our history.* On our military's bombing of our mosques in order to blame the Greek Cypriots and set the Cyprus conflict in motion, google "YirmibeA<U+009F>oÄ<U+009F>lu" (the Turkish three star general General who participated in ordering the secret bombings) as well as "Bayraktar" and "A<U+0096>meriye" mosques. The revelations came early in 2011. There are already some scholarly articles confirming it as well as confirmation in our more sober press. The event was essentially a repeat of when our Turkish government secretly bombed Ataturk's birthplace and blamed Greeks triggering wide-scale violent riots against the remaining Greek in Turkey in the 1950's (see wikipedia "Istanbul Pogrom") 
tt0104382;  Peter is doing his military service in the north part of Sweden. One day he finds out that his best friend is fooling around with his girlfriend, who lives in Stockholm. He goes AWOL so that he can travel to Stockholm and confront her. On the way down he meets Hanna, who travel with her father, a scatterbrained knifes salesman played wonderfully by Kjell Bergqvist. This is the beginning of a fantastic lovestory. 
tt0104382; HIGHLY UNDERRATED - 5.2/10 IS A JOKE!!Wonderful comedy (and romance) about a young Swedish guy doing his military service in the north of Sweden while drifting apart from his girlfriend back home in Stockholm! He stumbles in to a girl that later helps him getting back to Stockholm so he can solve some issues/problems with his girlfriend - and of course an attraction between the two is unavoidable..The characters develops an amazing chemistry and they all goes to the to heart of the viewers - overall the characters feels very genuine and original and the movie heartwarming! I'll give it a 10/10 cause of the pure entertainment you get out from it! 
tt0367104;  What a story, just look at this movie with your family or your friends or with your brother or sister, it will feel better. Why? (easy question) because this movie definitely very very funny. The first time I saw this movie with my sisters we all laugh so hard. Just look at Miriam Yeung acting as an undercover cop who very coincidence liked by Daniel Wu (that was the first time I saw Daniel), she was so funny. Beside this movie is not having a short plot like other movies.I should say to the director that he was succeed to make this movie as one of the best from Hong Kong's Cinema.Daniel as a prince charming and Miriam as a modern and funny cinderella, why not? 
tt0367104;  Although Love Undercover isn't one of the best movies around, I believe it's worth watching. Fans of the romantic comedy genre and of Hong Kong stars Miriam Yeung and Daniel Wu as both the male and female leads, will find this movie worth their while. The suddenly flamting Daniel Wu seems to be everywhere these days and he'll probably go up from there. Miriam Yeung is adorable - it is no wonder why she is at the top of the box office. She'so at the top of her league - undeniably the best comedic actress around today. Sammi Cheng - she's hot on your tail! Pick it up - it'll give you some laughs and eye candy as well. :)  
tt0367104;  surprisingly salaeble last year but comments went very extreme. perhaps hong kong's undergoing a transformation in culture.  to those who in it find nothing enjoyable may also find nothing funny and even feel  uncomfortable in this comedy. there seems to be a stab at the traditional value although not so sharp is it. so no wonder some people really get riled with its style. but something traditional or conventional is still preserved.  like Pretty Woman, the love story offers a every-girl dream - a charming, rich and loyal boy friend.  quite entertaining and some parts even moving. reason of course is not the main concern. in fact everything goes crazy. but can audiences other than those living here can grasp the humour ??? that's a question.  perhaps it can be viewed as a key to understand the philosophy of new generation. the style reminds me of Johnny English. so take it easy. it's a nice comedy but please don't expect too much. 5/10 
tt0367104; I watched this film based on all the good audience reviews I read. If anyone wants to see 2 fine actors such as Daniel Wu and Miriam Yeung performing in a wonderful, charming, romantic comedy then I'd have no hesitation in recommending ...Drink Drank Drunk.If on the other hand staring at Daniel Wu for 2 hours would be entertaining for you, then Love Undercover is just the ticket!Miriam plays a lovably dumb Policewoman who stumbles her way onto a case involving triads. Hunky Daniel plays the son of a triad who becomes enamoured by Miriam. Miriam likes Daniel but wonders is he or isn't he (a triad). The majority of the target audience are probably also wondering is he or isn't he (gonna take his shirt off).This film is basically Police Academy set in Hong Kong. It's a little silly, a little juvenile, and also a little charming. It's good but not that good. 
tt0367104; This movie is the best. A romantic comedy with Miriam Yeung, she is a great actress. To tell you the truth this is the first time i had ever seen Daniel Wu. i have seen Miriam before but not Daniel, he is a total babe. In one scene they were protecting the dad because there was a bullet went through a banana because they are all undercover cops they protect him but he gets more beat up and not a bullet in him. And Kuen ( Miriam Yeung) falls in love with the "target" aka Hoi (Daniel Wu) and them she gets taken of her case. And they get back together planning to get married and he doesn't know that she is cop still and her since her father was shot that was before she got taken of the case finds out from her trusty ketchup bottle that has a mic, she finds out that he is going to kill Micky. And from then she stops the killing and they break up she gets shot by his ex girlfriend which he never liked and was jealous of kuen so its happily ever after and they get together.

tt1684567; WOW! This film is rather difficult to review. It was also rather difficult to watch. Before I begin listing the numerous negatives, I'll start by saying that at least VISIBLE SCARS kept me watching until the very end. This is partly due to the fact that the main character and her best friend are rather easy on the eye and there's also a rather cute, albeit annoying, hippie chick. It's also partly due to the fact that I respect Tom Sizemore (Heart & Souls, Natural Born Killers, Saving Private Ryan, True Romance) and I was desperately trying to understand his motives for lending his name to this seemingly low-grade nonsense. He must've owed someone a favour.The opening scene gripped me mildly and I was hoping to be gripped tighter as the film went on. Alas, the B-grade acting failed to improve, the plot was all over the place, the death sequences were pathetic and (without spoiling anything) the less said about the ending, the better. By the halfway mark I began to ask myself why I hadn't turned it off yet. It's mainly because I still wasn't sure where they were going with the plot. Unfortunately I don't mean that in a good way. Even though I was rooting for the end credits to roll, during the final 30 seconds I found myself thinking, "The credits better NOT be about to roll... because if they are... this film went absolutely nowhere!" Then the end credits rolled.To sum up, VISIBLE SCARS is an atrociously acted, shoddily scripted, mindless mess that begins and ends nowhere. I can't explain my reasons for rating it 4/10 as opposed to 1/10 without adding a spoiler alert. Needless to say I'm being VERY generous. Don't bother watching it unless you're a huge fan of bad horror flicks and you're totally desperate. Watch Guillermo del Toro's MAMA instead.Check out my IMDb List for some better suggestions. "HORROR/THRILLER: Obscure, Overlooked & Underrated" http://www.imdb.com/list/8QFZ78e4Ar8/ :) 
tt1684567; Visible Scars is an indie thriller, which released in the middle of April. This title won "Best Picture" at the 2012 Shockfest and there is a reason why. This multi-genred film builds momentum as it moves through Acts II and III. Beginning slowly, Visible Scars draws the viewer in to a story of abuse, which later turns into murder. This title is a compelling film, with an intriguing conclusion.The story is dual in nature. The film begins with two sisters, who are kidnapped by a psychopathic man and killer. They are raised in poor conditions, until their new home is destroyed by an accidental fire. The film moves ahead several years. The second half of the story involves a new group of characters. Stacy (Jillian Murray) is a young girl who is looking for peace of mind. She has recently been abused by her boyfriend, Brad (Jonas Fisch). So, she seeks shelter in some local woods. Unfortunately for Stacy, these woods are now ruled by a bloodthirsty tour de force. Let the mayhem begin! Some of that mayhem can be found in the film's wide assortment of characters. Viewers should try and spot the protagonist. Is there one? Instead of a hero or central figure leading the story, there are numerous minor characters introduced and outroduced often and quickly. The minor cast of characters are still multiplying into the third act of the film and even ten minutes before the film ends. This is an unusual way to develop a story. Yet, the narrative works, by keeping events on screen interesting, with all of these diverse personalities.The film also pulls off a bait and switch, in regards to genres. Visible Scars begins as a crime thriller. An early murder takes place and then a kidnapping. So, viewers might be expecting a simple detective story to take place. But, at the midpoint of the film, the genre changes to horror, unexpectedly. The criminal investigation is mostly forgotten as more and more bodies turn up in some woodland. The gore increases along with the bloodflow and a few viewers might not know who is causing all of the chaos. There are a few surprises to be found in this feature, which is one of the film's more enjoyable elements.Visible Scars is a compelling and very watchable feature. Richard Turke's first feature film is well shot. There are several great external shots involving natural scenery. The setting is a sight to see. As well, the acting in this feature is well done. Actress Jillian Murray brings a great performance with her character Stacy. Stacy has a few personalities hidden under her beautiful exterior. And, Murray hints at her character's strangeness. Other actors bring equally solid performances. Also, Visible Scars picks up speed as it moves through the film's climax and into the conclusion. Just when you expect the film to keep going, it ends too soon and the open ending might leave some wanting more. These elements and many more make this indie thriller a must-see.Visible Scars was released, in this critic's opinion, under-the-radar April 6th, 2013 on DVD. This title is available for only a few dollars ($5-6) and this horror film fanatic would recommend this film to fans of indie thrillers. Though, viewers will have to be patient as Visible Scars takes awhile to develop. But, the payoff and ensuing chaos is well worth the wait. Visible Scars is a must-see that most will not forget. And, some viewers will even be expecting a sequel. 
tt1684567; If you want a horror movie that is a perfect example of so bad its good, this is it. This movie was $1.60 and it was worth every penny. The dialogue is line a minute hilarious and quotable, the story is awful but still better than some mainstream horrors, the acting isn't that horrendous but still pretty b-level. The most ridiculous flaws that stood out actually were the wardrobe decisions! the main detective's outfits always seemed several sizes too small and his ties were never done right. People wore wigs that had absolutely no reason to be wearing wigs and just the entire cast all looked strange and unnatural. This whole thing was all just a big basket of poorly made crap that is absolutely enjoyable til the totally shitty end. watch it.this has been a review of Visible Scars. 
tt1684567; The movie was a big piece of cow (mixed in with horse) manure. Can't believe I wasted 1:42 watching this. It's like a made for TV movie: a bit slow paced, not too bloody, acting was a bit bland, the story background on one of the characters almost nonexistent, and the fact that the "scarring" was hardly noticeable (or believable as to how it was acquired), I could handle all that - BUT as you near the ending I think the editing department saw that it was too long, and ended up chopping the final scenes into disconnected pieces, leaving you with a sense of what just happened? It could've been a nice little movie, if they had put a little more effort into the last half of it. In other words written an ending that made some sense. There are a lot of good examples out there to learn from, like the reviewer Tahnik stated referring to "Mama" as one. So let's hope things improve in the future. 
tt1684567; The Starting of the movie was literally amazing. But at the end of the director literally destroyed the whole movie.I was Really hoping something good from this movie. But my expectations were ended in smoke.I think the director was just wanting to release it and earn some money. If he really worked on the movie it would be a very good movie.The gore scenes were very bad. It was like i'm watching a movie from 1960.I think Mama was a very good movie. Director should learn from that movie. 
tt1684567; I don't really get the negative press on this film. It is actually a good watch. It's kind of a mix of Friday the 13th and the Hills Have Eyes, but with a more subdued, almost quiet intensity. It has it share of kills, but over all uses mood and creepy vibes over gore. Watching it felt like watching a late 70s suspense movie, but with that touch of mystery where you really don't know till the end if you are dealing with something supernatural or not. Then of course, there is Tom Sizemore. His part is fairly small, but it is easily his best performance since Natural Born Killers. Many will compare the two roles, but this character is a totally different kind of psycho. He is also kind of mystery himself. You never really know what the deal is with him. He is just nuts.As far as the "cliffhanger" ending, its really not that much of a cliffhanger. I won't say what happens, but its more just an open ended kind of deal. Again, reminding me of Friday the 13th. Regardless of that, a sequel is probably in the works. 
tt1684567; do not watch this movie!!! I'm talking to the staffs who made this kind of movie , change your names because your names are written at the end of the one of the most awful movie!!! what kind of movie was that?? that was awful from the beginning and as i watch the movie it gets downward to the bottom of the all awful arts in history.the plot was not something which you would be able to make a ten movie , and by that kind of scenario and directing and ... i have to double my anti depressant drug. BTW what kind of ending was that??? I think as producers got into the end of project they felt like an empty pocket , so they said "ok thats enough we have already shoot 1:40 Min's now we can take it on DVD and sell it as a movie". at last "visible scars"!!!! which scars??? i didn't saw any scars that would make someone name the movie after it!! sorry everyone , I'm not angry , actually happy after watching this comedy movie, I'm just disappointed of American film industry.. 
tt0110979; For two years this, and the original, sat on my shelf, because of the previous review. The movie isn't equal to the original, but it follows well enough. Melinda Clarke, although not a top name actress, has been on screen plenty of times. She's a decent actress, and has model quality beauty (which she plays in the movie!).The 'Fabio-wannabe' is a second rate actor. His counter part in the original was charismatic, where this guy is overly dramatic. His acting reminds me of a soap opera actor. A lot of this had to do with the director, blocking out cheesy scenes.The sex scenes are not as racy, or as artistically done. Considering the nudity in the first, I was surprised that this lower budget version had much less, and didn't start until nearly 40 minutes into the film. They even had a 'wet t-shirt' moment available under the water fall, and didn't.Overall, if watched back to back with the original, the continuity allows for a decent movie, with a decent story line. Watched all by itself though, there isn't enough quality directing or acting to say it was nearly as good.I give it at least a 5.0 instead of the 2.2 it had. 2.2 is no acting, no directing, and no story - far from the case here. 
tt0110979;  "Return to Two Moon Junction" is a horrible sequel to the underrated original, written and directed by Zalman King and starring "Twin Peaks" star Sherilyn Fenn.  This one stars unknown no-talent Melinda Clarke as the sister of Fenn's character April who returns to find out that grandmother Louise Fletcher (what was she thinking?)  Obviously the person who bought Two Moon Junction is some Fabio-wannabe with no acting talent what-so-ever.  They then engage in corny, sudden, and silly sex.  Blah. Blah. Blah.Horrible.  OnE STaR  
tt1709694; Kyle is a loving partner, brother, and son. He has dreams of having his own interior design company and plans to marry his partner Julian. All Kyle's plans come to a halt after he is introduced to crystal meth one night. Slowly after, Kyle's life and everything in it begins spiraling out of control.Based on true events, Meth Head is a really eye opening experience. Jane Clark weaves a story about meth addiction without making it solely factual and focuses mostly on the deep emotional character journeys.Kyle isn't a man without issues. While he has a job and partner, Kyle is still desperate in seeking his father's approval, a politician who isn't supportive of his son's life. Lukas Haas plays Kyle, the meth addict and main character. Haas gives Kyle some great characteristics which make him vulnerable and sympathetic regardless of the mistakes he makes. It is sometimes painful to watch his meth addicted performance because of the glimpses of normality Haas portrays in the very beginning of the movie. The scenes near the very end are the most heart wrenching of Haas's portrayal. He is alone and weakening and the actor really delivers the fear and panic without being unnecessarily over the top.Luke (AKA Dusty) is one of the stand outs in the film. He's the dealer who initially introduces Kyle to meth. Somehow, there's a youthful innocence about him. Blake Berris portrays him as an addict who loves the drug but one who never sees his life spiraling so out of control. Dusty's easy friendship with Kyle is simple and co-dependent. Berris depicts Dusty as a man who doesn't really have anything left and whose addiction leads him to a very painful place. Berris's performance is understatedly powerful.Necar Zadegan plays Maia, the third member of the meth trio. Also an addict, Maia lost her daughter to social services for being an unfit mother and takes care of her grandmother who lives with her. Out of the three of them, Maia seems like the most balanced mentally regardless of her addiction and everything going on in her life. She somehow holds the group together. Zadegan portrays Maia in an almost mature way. Zadegan shows us through her eyes and reactions that she knows she's making mistakes but continues to use meth because it seems like the only thing keeping her from falling apart. Zadegan really uses her body language to portray Maia's inner turmoil.Wilson Cruz plays Julian, Kyle's partner. Cruz's portrayal of Julian is one of equal parts patience and frustration. Julian wants the best for Kyle and tries to help, but when things get out of control Julian shies away from pushing too hard for Kyle to see the error of his ways. With only the grim tug of his lips Cruz lets us know how hard Kyle's meth addiction is on Julian.The supporting actors (Scott Patterson as Kyle's father comes to mind specifically) do a great job of adding to the story while letting the focus be on Kyle and his journey through his addiction.With wonderful portrayals and a well written story, Jane Clark really brings home a powerful message while staying true to the emotional story of the characters. "Meth Head" is a well told and hypnotizing film from start to finish. The journey through addiction is well thought out and extremely realistic. The movie is hard to watch at times only because it takes the characters to very dark and harrowing places."Meth Head" is sad and tragic. Writer/director Jane Clark chooses to tell the story in a gritty and blunt manor that serves the purpose of informing and acknowledging the addiction to meth and the people it affects. 
tt1709694; Based on true stories Meth Head cleverly takes you into the downward spiral of drug use, not glorifying it at all. We all have a little or even a lot of Kyle in us which makes this movie even more powerful. Lucas Haas is outstanding in the lead role showing a boyishness & gentleness that is impossible not to like, as does Blake Berris, in fact the whole cast deliver sterling performances. Director Jane Clark has done a superb job with everything about this movie, & the haunting music of Curt Smith compliments the scenes it covers. Do yourself a favour & see it, especially if you have teenage kids that might think Meth is okay after shows such as Breaking Bad. 
tt1709694; This is a movie about meth addiction fully approved by the current narrow minded LGBT regime. It is completely unrealistic and boring. From the get go, we never see the good times on the metamphetamine highs. It is just one big depressing lecture on "drugs are bad for you" laid on so thick, it's patronising. It's all about the "decent" family and friends, and all emphasis put on their worries. They never for one second realise that it is their mediocrity that turns the protagonist into a meth junkie in the first place. And honestly, the wispy latino boyfriend is so annoying, it would turn anyone into a crackhead.I would find it very odd that a gay man addicted on meth, doesn't hang round gay buddies to go out with and to have sex with. Where are the parTy scenes? Instead we find him hanging about in a very weird house in a situation that is utterly convoluted. Neither is it very believable that the Luks Haas character would be able to prostitute himself, with those haggard looks, when there is thousands of better looking guys whoring themselves out for free for a bit of Tina. That is the real L.A. gay scene, not this PC crap.I stopped watching halfway through, because this film has no redeeming qualities at all. If you actually want to watch a gay film about meth, and enjoy it, then watch (Circuit) instead. 
tt1709694; Meth Head is the story of a young gay man Kyle, played by Lucas Haas (Witness, Inception) who takes crystal meth at a party and finds himself spiralling out of control from the addiction shortly after. His loving partner, Julius, played by Wilson Cruz (Party of Five, Red Band Society) tries desperately to save him from himself. Unfortunately, the draw of the drug and the new friends he has acquired takes him down this dark path of destruction. His new friends, Maia and Dusty, are portrayed brilliantly by Necar Zadegan (24, Elena Undone) and Blake Berris (Days of Our Lives, Crazy Bitches). The bond they all develop over the use of this life altering drug is very raw and incredibly deep. The damage that is caused is devastating. There are several supporting actors who are exceptional from Barbara Niven (Cedar Cove, A Perfect Ending) to Tom Sizemore (Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down) and Theo Rossi (Sons of Anarchy). This is a very powerful film that I believe needs to be seen. Jane Clark, Writer/Director, takes you on a gritty ride into the depths of despair created by the use of crystal meth. Her careful direction allows the viewer to feel an emotional connection with Kyle. The story she has written tells an accurate account of how bad things can happen to good people through drug addiction in my opinion. I highly recommend this film. You won't be disappointed. 
tt1709694; I'm blown away with meth head, iv been trying to find the words all night but, nope lol, i was drawn in, hook line and sinker, within the first 5 minutes, i am impressed with how you managed to capture all aspects of life, when it comes to the addict, the way it affects everyone around the addict,,, i went from sister of addict, to addict selling myself for meth, losing every thing because of what i became while i was using, my family, husband, kids, to recovered addict, and now i am having to watch one of my kids playing with meth, i also have a 77 yr old man living with me that i took in as he was being abused and neglected by a meth head, ( my daughters ex boyfriend ), so you can see why i can relate to your movie so well,, amazing ,,, just amazing,,, I'm standing and applauding you and your crew, thank you for shearing your story, it is a brave thing to do and it is going to make a difference :) Angie 
tt0144608;  In my own opinion, this was a great movie. But to tell the truth i only watched it for Brendan's voice. The plot was great, the story was well read, but the animation sucked. The way the charectors moved, it seemed like they were made of paper. In my opinion, the movie shouldnt have been animated, it should have been acted out. that would have made the movie more interesting and more real. 
tt0144608;  Implementing the latest technology for special effects in a film has had it's hits and misses, never more so in full length animated motion pictures. The realization of 3D Computer Generated Images (CGI) have been restricted to companies like Pixar (Monsters, Inc., Toy Story) or PDI-Pacific Data Images (Antz, Shrek). But the images have been primarily of funny animals with cartoonesque rendering of humans. Game manufacturer SquareSoft tried with their technologically superior, but vapid tale "Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within".Now, an India based company, Pentafour, tries with a superior bend in their storytelling and artistic design with "Sinbad". Although their movement software isn't as smooth or as well rendered as "Final Fantasy", the story is much more engaging, making it another good entry in the myriad tales of the most famous sailor since Popeye.Brendan Fraiser seems to have found his niche in these characters (along with his work in the Mummy films) giving voice to the adventurous young salt on another mission of danger, discovery and romance. The conceptual designs, especially in the undersea kingdom are excellent. You just have to get past the somewhat stilted animation style and renderings of the human characters and it makes for a pretty good entry into someone's animation film collection. 
tt0144608;  Watching this was rather disconcerting.  Some parts of it (like the water) are animated beautifully.  Combined with some photographic backgrounds and the results are impressive.However all the characters look like they're animated with a Nintendo 64 or a home PC with a mediocre graphics card.  It really breaks the suspension of disbelief.  Think Tombraider quality, not Quake III. 
tt0144608;  This movie is not only boring, it is also really badly done. The graphics are so bad, they are not even second rate - they are dreadful. The characters do not show any facial expresssions, the voice acting is empty and without any soul, and the plot absolutely lacks .... well... anything and everything. My 5 year old likes it - but thinks it's a bit boring. I agree with him. 
tt0144608;  Although it doesn't reach the level of a great movie everything in it is well done.  The script is good and the voices and reading of great quality. The human figures are well animated but, for my taste, too close to reality. That destroys a little the spirit of fantasy and creates a feeling of ambiguity.  Nice backgrounds and fantastic architecture.  Of interest to any age because of it's overall visual pleasantness and narrative quality. 
tt0144608;  This thing is really awfull. ThereÂ´s no charachter with weight, theyÂ´re all floating around in the BGÂ´s. The Motion Capture is a fine toy, but this movie demostrates that you really need people who knows animation to do an animated film. THE MACHINE CANÂ´T DO ANYTHING WELL BY ITSELF. If you see it as a bizarre film, youÂ´ll have fun finding mistakes of continuity... IN A 3D MOVIE!!! ItÂ´s funny to watch the princess dress move around like a thing with diferent phisics. You need animators and 3D animators, not data-entries whom know 3D programs. Note the junctions, like the elbows, how they lost volume and get deformed. The person who made the charachter design (a very good one) sufered for sure when he/she watched them move, Â´cos you canÂ´t say they come to life.  
tt0144608;  Great effort to create an animated movie in three D. The plot in this case was secondary to the effects of making animated characters jump out at you on the screen.  It was easy to follow with the fantasy of Sinbad and the princess reaching the depths of the ocean to find the answer and antidote for breaking the spell cast by the nefarious bad guy. The art of animation has been pushed further along due to this effort and a new bench mark set. Only those who risk going too far will ever know how far they can go. Worth watching young or old.  My grandchildren loved it.  
tt3554976; South Korean trademark genre "Revenge Thriller" is back with Jeong-ho Lee's "Broken" based on the novel by Japanese novelist Keigo Higashino.A widowed father Lee Sang Hyeon (Jeong Jae Yeong) is seeking vengeance after her only daughter is raped and murdered. He is utterly disgruntled by ineptitude of police until he finds a clue about the murderers, he takes the law in his own hands and kills one of the murderers. Now he becomes a fugitive and detective Eok-Gwan (Lee Sung-Min) is in his pursuit. Broken is a carefully crafted film with gloomy and revolting notions. It raises questions about juvenile felony and adult crimes. It rather blemishes of Korean law regarding juvenile delinquency. Is it veracious to kill minors who are involved in heinous crimes because Korean Law does not have a rigorous imprisonment system of minors? We can hear a lot of conversations in the movie regarding the moral or ethical verdict."Broken" unveils many contemporary concerns: adolescent bullying in schools, teenage prostitution and incompetent judiciary system. Jeong-ho Lee makes you embroil up with the characters and their dilemma is felt in every manner. The begrimed mood goes very well with immaculate cinematography.The actors are perfect in their roles, every character has been played with utmost solemnity. Lee Sang Hyeon gives a stunning performance as a devastated and unforgiving father."Broken" is a thoughtful look at vehemence and violence with use of definitive elements of film-making.My Vote 7.5/10 
tt3554976; I was very skeptical at first, but after reading the synopsis of the movie I decided to give it a shot. I was well rewarded for that decision. As a father with a daughter who is the love of my life, I found the story line very appealing and riveting. The acting was superb. I identified with what the father was going through after his daughter's death and actually believe that I would seek out my own personal justice too. All of the actors were great. I was very surprised at the level of entertainment that this movie provided. I never left my seat for the entire movie. I hope to see more entertaining movies such as this one in the future. I highly recommend that you sit down and watch this movie. You won't be disappointed. 
tt0069881; DYNASTY OF BLOOD (aka BLOOD BROTHERS, 1973) is one of a group of near-epic historical adventures produced by Shaw Bros., directed by Chang Cheh, and starring David Chiang and Ti Lung. (The others include THE HEROIC ONES, THE NEW ONE-ARMED SWORDSMAN, DEADLY DUO, and SEVEN BLOWS OF THE DRAGON.) The star pair is joined here by then-rising kung fu star Chen Kuan Tai (BOXER FROM SHANTUNG) and the three portray bandits who join the army to suppress a rebel movement in old China. One of the trio, Ti Lung, rises to the rank of general and gradually turns against his buddies, particularly after he begins an affair with the wife (Li Ching) of one of them. The action culminates in a tragic series of deaths and a drawn-out downbeat ending. The film is two hours long and would have benefited, perhaps, from a little cutting.Shot at outdoor locations and large fortress sets, the film offers plenty of swordplay and battle action as well as a handful of kung fu bouts, all staged by action director Lau Kar Leung. It's colorful, exciting, beautifully shot, and features the three leads in more multi-faceted roles than they were normally given. The interplay of three friends involved in a violent business and the gradual onset of betrayal foreshadows similar themes found some 15 years later in the Hong Kong films of John Woo (who was assistant director on this film), most notably A BETTER TOMORROW and BULLET IN THE HEAD.ADDENDUM (6/18/08): Since I did the above review, a Region 3 DVD of the film, in Mandarin with English subtitles, has come out from Celestial Pictures as part of their line of restored and remastered Shaw Bros. releases. The widescreen picture is beautiful, but the "restoration" does have a problem. The remixed soundtrack includes extraneous added sound effects, including constant bird chirping, enough to nearly ruin the climactic action sequences. When it comes out on R1, that problem should be eliminated.Also of note is a 2007 remake of BLOOD BROTHERS, called THE WARLORDS, a China/Hong Kong co-production directed by Peter Chan and starring Jet Li, Andy Lau and Takeshi Kaneshiro in the roles played by Ti Lung, Chen Kuan Tai and David Chiang, respectively. It's not a martial arts film, but is instead a big-budget epic war drama with battle scenes featuring hundreds of extras. The love triangle is there but is downplayed in favor of the moral conflicts between the brothers that arise over the conduct of war. The actors are all superb, with Jet Li proving what a great dramatic actor he is. It's a very different kind of film from BLOOD BROTHERS and is highly recommended. 
tt0069881; THE BLOOD BROTHERS is not only one of the best movies Shaw brothers ever produced, it's also one of the greatest martial arts films ever, full stop.The story follows three men--Chang, Huang and Ma. The former two are good friends and partners in crime, who make a living stealing from travellers, but Ma is a refined man with great ambition and a desire for power and fame. Chang and Huang, despite having different goals to Ma, become his close friends and join forces with him to conquer a rebel outpost, receiving the surrender of a small army of warriors. All seems to be going well, until an affair starts between Ma and Huang's wife, but is cut short by his decision to join the army, where he can finally make a name for himself. Ma's success in battle leads him to fame and he requests the aid of his two good friends, Huang and Chang, in crushing rebels. But power proves more important to Ma than friendship...The fight choreography is consistently outstanding, from the lighthearted opening fight scene to the stunning, emotionally charged finale. Weapons are put to good use, Chang's use of the three-section staff stands out in particular. Slow motion is also used well, especially in the last battle.Production values seem surprisingly high, with thousands of extras, weapons and costumes on display. The sets are well made, although some outdoor scenes are obviously filmed inside a studio.Despite some minor flaws, THE BLOOD BROTHERS stands out as a highly memorable martial arts epic, with a more involved plot than the usual kung fu movie. Chang Cheh was a talented director and the THE BLOOD BROTHERS is one of his classics. 
tt0069881; Blood Brothers (1973) was a depressing film that was based upon a true story. During the waning days of the Ching Dynasty, a soldier (David Chiang) is accused of murdering a high ranking Provencial Governor (Ti Lung). A trial is held and the soldier writes out an account of what happened between the two men and what led to his murder. We find out that Ma (Ti Lung) was fooling around with his best friend's wife. Even though the three men were considered "blood brothers" and treated each other as if they're blood relations. In a desperate attempt to get rid of his friend and erase the shame and dishonor of having an affair with a married woman (the three brothers refer to her as sister), he has him killed.Chiang knows that Ma had his best friend killed so he vows to honor his dead friend and tries to assassinate Govenor Ma. He only wounds him before the two have a bloody fight that leaves Ma dying from a nasty stomach wound. The judge doesn't believe a word he says and has him beaten and throttled. Sentenced has been passed. Not only will he be executed for murdering Govenor Ma but for the death of his friend as well. He's taken out by Ma's henchmen and in a scene that was later "used" in BRAVEHEART, Chiang was disemboweled with a knife and a hook whilst tied up. His "sister" watches from her room as he's slowly gutted to death. Ma's men are pleased as he finally get's his justice served. Directed by Chang Cheh.Highly recommended. 
tt0069881; The Blood Brothers is one of the best Kung Fu movies of all time for many reasons. First, it is one of the few Kung Fu movies that has a plot that not only makes sense, but it is a bit more complex. Second, all actors are amazing. Third, the story begins as a flashback, something that is rare in Kung Fu movies. And this is well done.The story follows two bandits, Chang Wen Hsiang (David Chiang) and Huang Chang (Chen Kuan-tai) who attempt to rob Ma Xinyi (Ti Lung). They fail to defeat Ma, and so they decide to join forces with Ma and become blood brothers.At first they take over a hill under the control of bandits and then train the bandits, creating their small private army. However, the wife of Huang, Mi Lan (Ching Li) falls in love with Ma. Ma tries not to see Mi Lan because he does not want to betray his blood brothers, but the film shows that he is in love with her.After a few years Ma recruits his blood brothers and his private army to the Qing army and they fight rebels. But Ma's love for Mi Lan will lead him to betray his blood brothers................That is a synopsis of the plot. The story lets you know from the start that Chang killed Ma. So what keeps the plot interesting is how those close friends could kill each other.The only criticism I can make is that while the film makes the love story between Ma and Mi Lan believable and while it also makes believable that Chang and Huang are friends, it spends little time developing the relationship between Chang and Huang and Ma. Ma never seems to be a real friend of the two bandits and the viewer cannot really believe that Chang and Huang believe so much on Ma. But this in no way means that the Blood Brothers is not a good movie. Also most Kung Fu movies use the plot as an excuse to connect Kung Fu battles. This movie uses the Kung Fu scenes to connect the Plot instead. Even without Kung Fu scenes, the movie would still be awesome. But the Kung Fu battles are awesome and really good to see.Now the rating:Plot: 4/5 Acting: 4/5 Kung Fu battles: 3/5 Scenery: 5/5So in total, this films ranks 8/10. It is an awesome film, one of the best Kung Fu movies, but the films fails in the blood brothers relationship part. Had it had more development between the three main characters, this might well had been ranked 9. 
tt2767354; Swamy ra ra released without any expectations and i can say it will reach all the expectations of a movie lover without a doubt. There are very few crime comedies released on tollywood screen and these kind of genre needs a lot of passion and expertise to screen up. In this context the director has lived up to all the expectations.STORY & SCRIPT: the story and script has been perfectly tailor made and especially the script has been penned down very carefully and we cant even show a black mark on the script. The story has a fresh and crispy feeling and it keeps us very comfortable on our seats. CAST & CREW: Nikhil has improved a lot in his dialog delivery and acting all credits to him and the director. Swathi once again shined in her naughty girl character and the two friends of nikhil had showed good acting skills too. Ravi babu is very good in his comic villain role.TECHNICAL DEPARTMENT:great technical values including editing and photography adds more color to this colorful movie and as a final word music has been really great in this movie and its sure to keep u humming all the way 
tt2767354; The movie starts off with a cool & composed parallel story tracks and later these two parallel tracks meet at a point in the second half. In film history there are very rare chances for "Parallel Track" movies to get a positive note at the Box Office , but this film being a low budget has bagged a very great positive response. The whole cast were at their best and were maintained a nice gripping story with enjoyable comedy. When it comes to the crew , Mr. Sudheer Varma the new debut director has done a great job by wielding his pen for dialogs and the Mega-Phone as the Director.The main element that has become hot topic is Mr. Richard Prasad's cinematography which was simply superb from the beginning and few scenes like "The chase scene along with song" and "The transaction scene in the rain" were like a treat to your eyes.Ultimately its a small budget massive film with a fragile story line developed in an awesome way. Must Watch.! 
tt2767354; Swamy ra ra The director has given tribute to great crime comedy directors like Ram Gopal Varma, Quentin Tarantino and Guy Ritchie with this film. Director Sudheer Varma came out with fresh film despite having so many influences. Swamy Rara is a perfect example for pure story telling using 24 crafts of filmmaking and for using actors just to play characters. Each and every character is important and makes an impact. We have seen umpteen number of Telugu filmmakers making debuts and wanting to make movies like Ram Gopal Varma post 1990. But nobody came close to RGV in making crime comedies like Chandra Sekhar Yeleti. After Chandra Sekhar Yeleti, I feel that Sudheer Varma came close to deliver RGV kind of crime comedy (Kshanakshanam and Anaganaga Oka Roju). On a whole, Swamy Rara is a class crime comedy. 
tt0029950; I caught this movie on TCM today and found myself throughly entertained. To my knowledge this was my first ever viewing. The cast was simply superb.....practically everyone. Fredric March was so dashing and effective, I had never realized what a talent this guy was. He even pulled off a French accent flawlessly....whoa! This version of The Buccaneer is simply far superior to the 1958 film which I've seen a couple of times. There was real magic in Hollywood during the 1930s, I'm not sure that town has ever totally recaptured what they had back then. This movie definitely belongs in there with the A list that includes Gone With the Wind, The Wizard of Oz, Captain Blood, Beau Geste, Tarzan, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Gunga Din, King Kong and all the rest. The script was by a GREAT historical novelist named Harold Lamb. This was a huge bonus for this movie. The story sticks fairly close to history and has a terrific pace. My only complaints are relatively minor....the battle at the end didn't quite live up to my expectations(though it probably did realistically portray the excitement and confusion of the participants) and Lafitte could have simply told the truth about the ship Corinthian which was sunk on the orders of another Pirate, not Lafitte. This was the reason Lafitte got chased away from New Orleans (according to the movie at least) Great movie, great leading man, great writing, great cast, great direction, great sets.....a classic. Oh yes, the actor portraying Andrew Jackson was dead on.....not that I have actually met Old Hickory mind you! 
tt0029950; Cecil B. DeMille in 1938 turned his talent for spectacle to the legend of pirate Jean Lafitte and his contribution for saving New Orleans from British occupation in 1815 at the battle that bears the city's name.The ironic part is that the Treaty of Ghent ending the War of 1812 had been signed a few weeks earlier, but news had neither reached the invading army commanded by General Edward Pakenham, brother-in-law of the Duke of Wellington, nor the Americans either in Washington, DC or the civil and military authorities in New Orleans. Had the British won they probably would have stayed for several years, I'm sure they wouldn't have given up so valuable a possession as the city that controlled the mouth of the Mississippi river.Jean Lafitte is one of those characters not from antiquity about whom we know neither the date of his birth or death. He was born either in France or Haiti around 1780 and probably died sometime in the 1840s. As soon as the Louisiana territory was purchased from France, he set himself up in business nearby New Orleans in the swamps of Barataria and did a flourishing business in the smuggling trade. He may have had as many as a thousand men under his command.Even after the fledgling American Navy attacked his stronghold, Lafitte for reasons of his own sided with the Americans in the fight for New Orleans that had nothing to do with the fictional romance portrayed in The Buccaneer. He did however provide men and supplies to Andrew Jackson's army and may have tipped the balance of the fight. Though he got a pardon as shown in the film, he resumed his pirate ways and eventually left New Orleans for Galveston Island. Eventually he was driven out of there in the next decade and after that we have no idea what really happened to him, though there is speculation.Fredric March makes a dashing Jean Lafitte and DeMille staged the battle up to his usual high standards of spectacle. In addition to the fictitious romance between Lafitte and the Governor of Louisiana's daughter played by Margot Grahame, the other part of the film that is wholly fictional is that involving the traitorous United States Senator played by Ian Keith. No such a person was around New Orleans, though there was an anti-war movement breaking out here, but in New England which saw its commercial trade ruined by both Jefferson's Embargo and the War of 1812.One thing that DeMille didn't do either in this film or the remake in 1958 was focus on Pakenham. The army that went to its slaughter in the swamps near New Orleans in a headlong assault were a veteran bunch of troops who had fought in the Peninsular War against Bonaparte. The commander was a much beloved brother-in-law of the Duke of Wellington and he fell gallantly leading his men. Wellington thought of Ned Pakenham more like a kid brother of his own than his wife's brother. He took the news of the defeat pretty badly. In fact the news cast a pall over Great Britain so recently celebrating Napoleon's exile to Elba. Fortunately they and Wellington recovered to route Bonaparte in his comeback attempt at Waterloo. Walter Brennan has a nice role as Andy Jackson's personal aide and Hugh Sothern is an impressive Jackson. DeMille introduced actress Franciska Gaal from Hungary in the role of castaway passenger from a ship that was plundered by one of Lafitte's ships. She didn't make much of an impression on the American public, perhaps it was her thick Magyar accent. After a film with Bing Crosby the following year, Paris Honeymoon, Gaal returned to Europe just in time for World War II and to a country allied with the Axis at that point. She was not heard from again on film.When the remake came out in 1958, Paramount shelved this version of The Buccaneer and was rarely shown for the rest of the century. I got to see it during a TCM retrospective of Cecil B. DeMille. It's good DeMille, but far from good history. 
tt0029950;  An excellent action movie with good pacing and development.  There is never a dull moment.  The movie shows more of Laffite's business dealings than with his pirate actions.  In actual fact Laffite was quite a businessman that the governor did want captured and did put a price on his head of $500. Laffite did respond to that but not for the $10,000 the movie stated.  One must never accept a movie's version of history but "The Buccaneer" does a quite credible job of drawing you into life in 1814 in New Orleans.  Laffite was offered $30,000 and other inducements by the British and the Americans did not believe him (this was very accurate).  His base in Barataria was destroyed though at a later time.  When the battle was over he did go back to sea as a pirate.  His days in New Orleans were indeed over.  So, sit back and enjoy a movie that is good entertainment and is also pretty good history.  This movie is proof that you can learn history from the movies.  
tt0029950; Having just moved back to Baton Rouge, La. in 2003 after living in Jacksonville, Fla. for the previous 16 years, I started getting reacquainted with the history of the state I had first lived much of my life from age 7 to 19. One of those sources was from this Cecil B. DeMille account of Louisiana's pirate-hero Jean Lafitte. It was he and his men who helped General Andrew Jackson with his troops defeat the British at The Battle of New Orleans. This was in exchange for a full pardon for him and his men after originally getting a price on his head from the Governor of The Pelican State. Fredric March makes a dashing Lafitte with Akim Tamiroff splendid as his sidekick Dominique. Margot Grahame is Lafitte's fiancA©e while Franciska Gaal is the Dutch girl Gretchen who falls for Jean after walking the plank from another ship that was lead by a man who betrayed Lafitte. Walter Brennan is funny here as Peavey, a sidekick to General Jackson (Hugh Sothern). Watch what happens when he and Tamiroff have a scene together! Because of some of the accents and the speed of some of the dialogue, I couldn't understand everything that was said but most of the time it was the action that got to me, especially when the American military men initially were attacking Lafitte's men as they were about to welcome them. Grahame and Gaal had their own feminine charms that made either one good chemistry with March so whichever one ended up with him would have been fine. I think I've said enough so I'll just say for anyone who loves a good old-fashioned story with some history thrown in, I highly recommend Cecil B. DeMille's The Buccaneer. 
tt0029950;  Plenty of action! Not a movie anyone will ever sleep through! The highs and lows of pirate life well depicted, even a "walking the plank" episode.When Lafitte the notorious pirate (Fredric March) comes a-courtin' to the home of his lady-love, Annette (Margot Grahame), a matron cries out in alarm to hide the silver as he might steal it. Here was an instant recall of similar words uttered in the film "Les Miserables," an earlier role March played so well, where as Jean Valjean he was looked on with suspicion by the housekeeper after seeking shelter in a priest's home. But as the pirate Lafitte he has plenty of stolen goods to pass on.Gretchen (Franciska Gaal) as a young Dutchwoman has a little terrier in tow at the beginning, and both are spunky! She soon encounters and falls in love with Lafitte and lets him know about it but sadly, his heart is elsewhere.I really enjoyed seeing Akim Tamiroff portray Dominique with such flair. As a supporting actor his fine style has always been colorful and convincing in serious or lighter roles. He's fun to watch in this one.Andrew Jackson (Hugh Sothern) gives us a glimpse of what war and fighting was really like in those early frontier days when militiamen were more often local recruits ill-prepared and ill-equipped.One can only wonder what would have been the course of American history if Lafitte had lived elsewhere.  
tt0029950; NEWS! This title has just been released in a shoddy copy on DVD. Wait until TCM shows it instead. I watched this film a couple of times while working on my own script. The War of 1812 is pretty much forgotten, except in Canada where it is part of the national identity. This is one of only three films that I know of in that setting.Jeanie Macpherson writes well. From the Burning of Washington to the treachery of people in high places (Senator Crawford may be fictional, but cowardly generals, smugglers and spies plagued the Northern Frontier earlier in the War--aka TREASON), the plot twists result in scenes of true emotional power. The ending is brilliantly foreshadowed so that the audience sees it coming like a runaway train. And the dialogue? Pay attention to the scene in which the pirates do not want to fight with the U.S. but with the British: March is given electric lines to speak. The only thing that I did not like was Dominique You's character. He is a bit too cartoonish.Fredric March gives a very good performance as Lafitte, but Franciska Gaal is wonderful as the dutch girl who loves him.The battle scenes hold up quite well today. This is obviously made by the same director as the magnificent The Crusades and Cleopatra. Its pace is also quicker than the first half of The Ten Commandments (1956).DeMille was at his peak in the 1930s. 
tt0029950; This a classic swashbuckling film....seemingly a film very typical for Cecil B. De Mille. Fredric March is superb in his role as Jean Lafite....also interesting to see Anthony Quinn as early as 1938. Do enjoy this piece of cinematic artwork. One must also remember that historically Andrew " Old Hickory " Jackson was eventually a U. S. President. Personally...I feel that March, Errol Flynn and Burt Lancaster (The Crimson Pirate) are the actors that best typified " Pirates " in classic Hollywood. Although today credit must be given to Johnny Depp in both of the Pirates of the Caribbean pictures which I thoroughly enjoyed and which of course reminded me of the above-mentioned actors and their films 
tt0029950; This was the third version I watched of the exploits of French pirate Jean Lafitte, but the first that was made, the others were LAST OF THE BUCCANEERS (1950) and the 1958 remake of the film under review. Interestingly, while De Mille himself produced the latter, he relinquished the directorial reins Â<U+0096> presumably because he was too ill for the task Â<U+0096> to his son-in-law, actor Anthony Quinn (who had a supporting role in the original!), whose only effort in this capacity it proved to be. For the record, two other cast members were similarly featured in both i.e. Douglass Dumbrille and Jack Pennick.Anyway, this was also the third in my Fredric March epic viewings (with one more to go): it is telling that the star's tendency towards ham (not helped by his adopting a foreign accent Â<U+0096> which did not really come into play when he interpreted an Italian in THE AFFAIRS OF CELLINI or a Russian in WE LIVE AGAIN {both 1934}!) was brought out by the director's idiosyncrasies (including a frequent resort to collective singing Â<U+0096> albeit of patriotic American songs rather than the usual salty ditties!) that, evidently, were not restricted to his frequent religious ventures. While fine in itself, then, the movie emerges as perhaps the least of De Mille's 1930s spectacles. Incidentally, it had been planned for a local TV broadcast in the mid-1980s which never materialized! As expected, the settings, crowd scenes and action highlights are elaborate as can be, the cast list, too, is extensive Â<U+0096> peppered with familiar faces and even a few award-winning actors (a delightful Akim Tamiroff as March's sidekick and a grumpy Walter Brennan, who enters late into the proceedings as his counterpart to General and future American President Andrew Jackson). The latter is effectively played by one Hugh Sothern, who reprised the role a year later for the two-reel short OLD HICKORY. On the other hand, the major female presences (one spunky and the other stately) are decorative more than anything else Â<U+0096> the former, Hungarian Franciska Gaal (here being groomed for U.S. stardom but which did not happen), is rather overbearing under the circumstances.The narrative sees privateer Lafitte side with the Americans against the British in the war of 1812, traitorous Senator Ian Keith does his best to make him look bad in the eyes of the people of Louisiana, even having the Navy massacre the pirate band intending to support them!, ultimately, they face-off in a swordfight inside a jail. Eventually, the "boss" reaches an agreement with Jackson, and his contribution (led by former Napoleonic cannoneer Tamiroff's expertise) is vital in repelling the much larger enemy forces. However, when all differences seem to have been settled, an old crime Â<U+0096> which a rogue section of Lafitte's men were responsible for but not he personally Â<U+0096> resurfaces, so the buccaneer is forced to go into exile, forever roaming the seasÂ Despite its historical pedigree, the film stands as an example of what used to be branded "enjoyable hokum", of which De Mille was a prime exponent, that said, its professionalism is undisputed and, in fact, Victor Milner's cinematography (which, for one night-time rallying sequence, turns sepia) garnered the movie its sole Oscar nomination. By the way, the "Leslie Halliwell Film Guide" erroneously lists this as having a mere 90-minute duration Â<U+0096> when, in fact, the TCM-sourced print I watched (exhibiting some picture instability halfway through which, however, were smoothed over upon being replayed!) lasted a good deal more at 126!! 
tt0029950; This film was pretty much what I expected from Cecil B. DeMille. In almost all of his films, you have a huge cast (this time in the thousands), elaborate sets and props, a rather silly romance and a desire for action and expense over realism and historical accuracy. Many love his films, but I find most of them time-passers.As for the romance, this film features two for Jean Lafitte (Frederic March), though the dominant one involves Franciska Gaal. She's rather a comic book-like figure--more a caricature than a believable person and this is pure DeMille, as is the romantic dialog. At least it was much better than the lines uttered in THE TEN COMMANDMENTS by the Princess, but this isn't saying much. DeMille just had no ability to convey real people and real romance--he was more the epic action and spectacle sort of director.Action-wise, there are some very long and well made scenes, though oddly, the naval sequences were awfully tepid. The battle scenes on land were handled much better and the costumes looked very nice.Historically speaking, this isn't a bad film but it does contain many inaccuracies. Apart from glamorizing Jean Lafitte (who was a smuggler and total jerk), it seemed to exaggerate his importance to the Battle of New Orleans. While he did "rat" on the English by telling the Americans of their invasion plans, most accounts place the number of troops he sent to fight to be just a few dozen at most (though they were gunners--a welcome addition). Also, the fact that this battle actually took place a month AFTER the peace treaty was signed wasn't mentioned--as communication was such in 1815 that the British and Americans could not let the troops know that the war had ended for several more weeks. This made the outcome of the battle unimportant (but certainly not to the soldiers involved) and would have taken away from the excitement of the film, so it was simply omitted.While I am complaining, I should also point out that the film never seemed to end. While it logically should have ended when this battle concluded, it continued and greatly lessened the film's impact and made me fidgety.Overall, there's a lot of action (I'd give this an 8), some dopey romance and dialog (I'd give them a 3), some good and bad historically speaking (I'd give it a 5) and the movie was overly long. Overall, I think a score of 5 is merited. A decent time-passer but that's about all. 
tt0069951; The big surprise in The Deadly Trackers is Rod Taylor's emergence as one mean and nasty villain here. Although he had played a bad guy early in his career in Hell on Frisco Bay as a contract killer, the public was used to Rod as the civilized fellow bringing a sense of order to a future world in The Time Machine. He's anything, but civilized in The Deadly Trackers.Richard Harris is a sheriff with some rather strange notions about capture instead of killing in a lawless land. Rod Taylor and his gang rob the bank in Harris's town and kill the bank manager on a whim. Then when Harris tries to capture and use reason with Taylor, Harris's wife and son become dead also.That gives our sheriff a whole new outlook and he hunts the gang into Mexico where he teams up with a federale played by Al Lettieri who has all the ideas Harris used to have. This was the farewell performance of Al Lettieri and interesting that he went out as a good guy here. He created a great group of villains in The Godfather, McQ, Mr. Majestyk, and The Getaway. He was a great talent.Some attention was paid to the fact that Harris is an Irish sheriff and for that matter Rod Taylor is Australian. But America is in fact a nation of immigrants and this should be no stranger than Errol Flynn's emergence as a western star in the heyday of the studio. 
tt0069951; Idealistic Sheriff turned vengeance-crazed whirlwind down Mexico way ( where as all Western fans know, anything goes). Richard Harris brings his unique (not to be confused with good) acting talents to the role. There's also Rod Taylor as the gross, ultra-violent and competent gang leader with Neville Brand complete with iron rail instead of a hand (yea, right!), William Smith doing one of his muscled, vacant-gazed idiot numbers and some black, dandyish gambler who I felt sorry for being subjected to the other gang members crap. The late Al Lettierri plays a decent, by the book Mexican Federale, which is a shame because he's much better at irrational, explosively violent sickos. A lot of hand-held camera work in this movie (and I don't just mean POV shots) gives it a low budget look, but the Mexican locales help out some. So why my interest in this film? Maybe it's just the shear down and dirty intensity with which Harris goes after that down and dirty gang. SPOILER- The scene where he throws an injured Lettierri through the Bar window, blasts the black gambler to smithereens and starts to kick a** and take names with the bar patrons is almost Apocalyptic. Rod Taylor exudes a very unpredictable, terrible menace in this film, too. Recommended for fans of sweaty westerns, but with no dubbed voiced Italian actors. 
tt0069951;  This is one of those films that lovers of the Western genre ought to rent on video. They will discover a treasure of the past that is well worth a watch. Like most Westerns, this film is set in the 1870s American southwest. The story of vengence is common in Western films, and this particular  tale is extremely brutal. The post civil war Southwest was a violent place full of vigilantism and crime.  Men of the West with morals and a sense of social responsibility always served as easy prey for bushwackers.The Deadly Trackers is focused on two men who share an over-developed sense of justice.  They are both sheriffs, and they both embraced the importance of the law.  One of the sheriffs loses his family, however, and his ideals die with them.  The best part of this film  is the relationship that builds between the two sheriffs as they hunt a small band of bushwackers.  Richard Harris's character is the embittered sheriff bent on vengence.  His character sinks into being as cruel and violent as the men he hunts.  The Mexican sheriff, who lacks personal loss, maintains an ideal sense of keeping law and order.  In the end, Harris's character regains his values for upholding the law only to see justice slip out of his grasp.  The Mexican sheriff remains constant in his efforts to enforce the law only to provide for a lack of justice.  The result is a dark tale about the nature of mankind on the frontier.         
tt0069951; After The Wild Bunch had pushed back a few boundaries in terms of violence, especially within the western genre, there followed a spate of similar westerns. Billy Two Hats, Chato's Land, The Hunting Party, The Revengers and The Last Hard Men were among the front-runners. Also on any list of brutal '70s revenge-westerns would be The Deadly Trackers, originally planned as a Samuel Fuller movie but completed by Barry Shear after Fuller quit the project. This violent, bloodthirsty film is, alas, somewhat disappointing.Irish sheriff Sean Kilpatrick (Richard Harris) looks after the Texas town of Santa Rosa and has made a point of solving crimes and capturing criminals without resorting to violence. In fact, he has never in his life fired a gun in anger, yet has somehow fostered total law, order and respect among the townsfolk. His methods are tested to the limit when outlaw Frank Brand (Rod Taylor in a surprisingly sadistic performance) and his gang rob the local bank. During their escape attempt, the outlaws inadvertently kill Kilpatrick's own wife and child. Devastated, Kilpatrick ditches his anti-gun, anti-violence attitude and pursues Brand and his cronies. The chase leads to Mexico, where Kilpatrick has no official authority and is viewed as little more than an outlaw himself. The Irish sheriff tracks down and kills Brand's gang one-by-one, until just he and Brand remain.Just a year earlier, Barry Shear had made the film Across 110th Street, regarded as the most violent movie ever made up to that point, so it's perhaps no surprise that this film emphasises the gore and brutality to the extent it does. Harris is quite memorable as the Irish sheriff, giving another of his energetic performances, and Taylor's villainous turn reveals an ugly side rarely portrayed by the actor in his other films. However, in most aspects The Deadly Trackers fails to make the grade as a good, worthwhile film. It is far too simplistic for its own good, with no resonance beyond the immediate plot (and the plot itself is pretty basic, being nothing more than a straightforward chase narrative). The supporting performances are generally rather lacklustre, possibly because none of the characters beyond the two principal players carry much depth or interest. Also, the story is dismayingly familiar, with precious little that it fresh or original, just lots of tired and predictable scenes that have been begged, borrowed and stolen from many other sources (even the music is lifted directly from The Wild Bunch.... perhaps to keep the budget down?) On the whole, The Deadly Trackers is a dismal misfire in which the detail to violence and the intriguing lead performances are the sole points of interest. 
tt0069951; I find it interesting how I can reconcile my feelings about this film. On the one hand, it's a boldly intense revenge Western, while on the other, there's so much nonsense going on that with any serious scrutiny one might dismiss it as gross caricature. Take the character of Choo-Choo (Neville Beand) for instance - how exactly did 1880's medical technology manage to graft a chunk of railroad track to his right arm? Then there's Gutierrez (Al Lettieiri), the Mexican Federale - you mean to tell me that he gets shot off his horse, does a forty foot swan dive over a cliff, and some time later manages to get up and walk away? I had him a goner, but if he could have survived, how so without a broken back? Then there's the main character himself, Sheriff Kilpatrick, ably portrayed by Richard Harris. Now I know it doesn't take much of a stretch to go from pacifist to hell bent avenger after seeing your family wiped out, but how about some discretion. Kilpatrick just jumps right in without thought of consequences, like jumping that big lug Schoolboy (William Smith). OK, I know that had to work out to keep the story going, but gee, the guy looked like he just finished a workout at World Gym.There's something else about Kilpatrick - did you notice that after every one of his bloody encounters (that first one with Schoolboy was the worst), he appears in the next scene with a clean set of duds. I didn't notice any Chinese laundries along the way, so it left me wondering how he might have managed that. Maybe I'm being picky, but didn't anybody else think about that?Here's something neat though - I liked the idea that Kilpatrick had the town of Santa Rosa so organized that they were able to back him up at a moment's notice with all hands on deck. If these were the citizens of Lago, there would have been no rest of the story in "High Plains Drifter". Something to think about.As for the finale, I'm not buying it. After all that Kilpatrick and Gutierrez had gone through to catch up with Brand (Rod Taylor), the Mexican lawman would just shoot him in the back as he rode away? Where's the code of honor among lawmen? Even if Gutierrez wanted to be hard core by the book with Kilpatrick, by the final showdown with Brand it was going to be self defense any way you slice it. So I have to ask, was that really necessary? 
tt0069951;  Richard Harris, who has appeared in quite a few westerns forbeing from across the Atlantic, tackles another role with gusto inthis hard hitting 1973 film.Harris is Kilpatrick, a pacifist sheriff in a Texas town. Rod Taylorand his gang rob the bank, kill a few people, and get set to ride offwith the loot. Harris blocks their departure with a system the townhas rigged up so as not to kill anyone, just capture them. He doesnot believe in guns, and only shoots to injure and scare, not kill.Taylor and the gang kill Harris' wife and child, and ride away, withHarris on their trail. He does not let that pesky Mexican borderdeter him either, as he rides on through and meets anotherlawman a lot like him.Al Lettieri plays Gutierrez, who is also after Taylor. However,Gutierrez's pacifism comes to annoy the viewer as well as Harris.The Mexican sheriff is insistent on letting justice prevail, alwayslooking for witnesses, and never just going after and killing thebloodthirsty gang.Harris begins to catch up to the gang, and dispatches them one byone, until he finally is down to two. He is also on his last nerve, ashe finally gives in to his gun's quick justice. The climactic shootoutin the convent, where Harris finds himself on the same level asTaylor, is very moving.Despite the (PG) rating, this is one violent film. Once the viewerovercomes this, they are definitely in for a wild ride. Harris is greatas the vengeful sheriff who will not die, and brings the sameintensity to this that he showed in the "A Man Called Horse" series.Rod Taylor goes down in western film history as one of themeanest villains on celluloid. One great scene has him describehow he murdered his father, as even his jaded gang looks at himin horror.In the outlaw gang- William Smith, who seems to have been ineverything and you will recognize him the minute you see him,does well as the seemingly retarded Schoolboy. Neville Brand isgood as Choo Choo, who earned that nickname because he hasa section of rail where his hand was. Paul Benjamin is great asJacob, a very intelligent black man who uses his wits to outsmartthe rest of the gang, but cannot get past how others feel about hiscolor.As mentioned before, the cast is great except for the character ofGutierrez. Eventually, he became a thorn in the side of Harris andthe audience. He never seemed to get what Harris was trying todo, and adhered so closely to the law that he became annoying.His final murderous act is more frustrating than noble.Shear's direction is okay, once in a while I would notice theshadow of a camera in an outdoor scene. His decision to use stillshots from the movie in the opening credits might have peoplechecking the pause button on their VCR, and I am not sure why hedid this. His actions scenes are good, with good stuntwork, butagain, be forewarned of the violence, especially directed towardchildren.Despite an equally awkward title, "The Deadly Trackers" is goodadult western fare that probably should have received more praisethan it has- especially for Taylor and Harris. I highly recommend it.This is rated (PG) but contains strong physical violence, stronggun violence, brief sexual violence, gore, strong profanity, very brieffemale nudity, and sexual references. 
tt0069951;  The Deadly Trackers was to be directed by the author of the original story, Sam Fuller. He was replaced by one or two other directors (identities unknown) and it was up to the dependable Barry Shear to complete the film. The opening sequence of stills and voice-overs is a liability to the overall film. My guess is that Shear, due to the chop and change of previous directors, had cobbled together pieces of their unfinished work. I would appreciate clarification of this from someone who knows. The importance of the opening sequence is that it establishes the motivation for the entire film. The violent shattering of this close-knit family drives the action - and should have given the viewer a greater appreciation of Richard Harris's despair. Otherwise Shear's film is an excellent thought-provoking western with an excellent performance by Al Lettieri playing the sheriff as the revenge-seeker's conscience. Vigilante theme worth comparing to films like Dirty Harry which was released two years earlier and set a trend in American cinema.Memo: Whoever wrote the line `He shot the roses from her cheeks' should have been shot himself.  
tt0069951; Samuel Fuller wrote this unusual western novel which is aptly directed by Barry Shear. It relates the story of a small town Sheriff, Sean Kilpatrick (Richard Harris) who hates guns and abhors violence. That is until a gang of ruthless but murderous bank robbing killers enters his village. Led by a clever, but unscrupulous murderer named Frank Brand (surprisingly played by Rod Taylor, who typically plays good guys) arrives to rob the bank but is quickly surrounded and easily captured. Nevertheless, Brand and his cut-throats escape. but not before shooting and killing innocents in the process. Filled with rage and vengeance, Kilpatrick set out to bring the killers to justice despite their crossing to Mexico. The group of criminals and law enforcement officers are made up of serious actors who typically play opposite sides of the law and include, Al Lettieri as a Mexican Constable (Excellent role), Neville Brand and William Smith, (supurb characters) as part of Brand's gang. The great, rugged Mexican outdoors and spacious landscapes are majestic and add to the bloodstained journey. Indeed, it's further enhanced with the violence and exciting action. An unusual treat for Taylor fans and an equally surprising role for the entire cast. Recommended to any who seeks a violent page torn from our wild Western Lore. **** 
tt0069951; An opening scene is one that will make the anti-gun group proud. The sheriff (a sober Richard Harris) explains that guns beget guns, etc. But when a group of super-nasties kill his school marm wife, and young son, it's a whole different story.It's vengeance time and the next hour or so has to do with the sheriff on a one-man quest to find the head baddie (Rod Taylor relishing the role) and the chase takes us into Mexico and a small village where, usually, nothing much happens.What happens in this flick is brutality piled on brutality, and violence up the ying-yang. Look at someone cross-eyed and you've had it mister.There is the requisite prostitute with the requisite heart of gold and, by the way, some of the best acting comes from her little girl who was fathered by Taylor. She really looks scared --- well, you know the phrase.So, the story is standard stuff, but it will hold your attention. The scenery is neat, the 'borrowed' music is neat and, for you lovers of violence, this is heaven on film although, to be honest, it is not as gross as you may have expected, since the films of Fuller are 'full-er' violence.The moral to the story? Revenge is not always sweet. Would the Lone Ranger have done it this way? 
tt0069951; Pacifist sheriff Richard Harris rethinks his civilizes ways, when his wife and son are murdered by ex-Confederate lowlife Rod Taylor and his nasty band of cutthroats. Abandoned by his posse at the border of Mexico, he goes it alone, butting heads with Al Lettieri (who's great in this), his idealistic Mexican counterpart, who wants to bring Taylor in alive for a local murder.A fast pace, plentiful action, good photography of beautiful Mexican locations, and a colorful cast of villains, that include William Smith as a disfigured brute, Neville Brand as an unpleasant cretin with a block of railroad track for a hand (!), and Paul Benjamin as a cultured, black dandy, make this worth watching for fans of hard-boiled, macho film-making.The film's message is a bit murky though. It seems as if the movie is demonstrating the dehumanizing effect of Harris' obsessive search for vengeance, which turns him into a man to be pitied.However, despite Mexican lawman Lettieri's great strength, dignity, and honor, his sense of true justice makes him look like less of a man too, when in the end he's forced by his rigid ideology to attempt to release the truly vile, smug killer and ends up shooting Harris in the name of the law.The film is either trying to have it both ways or telling us to choose our own morality!Like most of his western films (A Man Called Horse, Man In The Wilderness, Unforgiven), Harris takes an inhuman amount of physical punishment in this grim, sometimes mean-spirited, and excessively violent action/adventure, that somehow managed to sneak by with a PG rating! 
tt1210351; Great movie. Lots of food for thought. However, the only thing that bothered me was a short scene where the Israeli soldiers were portrayed as being unnecessarily cruel to the Palestinians. It was one sided and did not show what led to it and what these people did to deserve it. If it were explained in greater detail,then this scene would have made sense. As a matter of fact, It seemed as an afterthought and did not even belong in this movie. I am sure that the Israeli audience understood what went on without being explained to. They live through it. Nevertheless, when the movie reaches the rest of the world, this episode will only reinforce their false impression of Israel. Israel's public relation needs a boost, and even though that is NOT the purpose of the movie, it should not bend over backwards to do the opposite either. This is a great concern for people who live abroad, and see every day the unfairness in which Israel is portrayed in the media, and we should not give them cause to think they are right. In spite of it I enjoyed this movie and will recommend it to my friends. Thank You. Ada. 
tt1210351; When we left the theater after this movie, my wife took the opportunity to urge strangers to see it. It's that impressive.Childhood in an Israeli town of 1980 looks idyllic, and Erez, his twin brother Ofer, and their family all make the most of it, full of love, humor, and optimism, but it seems that the force that turns the generational wheels-- the magnetism of the opposite sex-- is a weakness that threatens the smooth course of life for them all both as individuals and as a family.Michael Moshonov and Oshri Cohen are perhaps the most unlikely-looking set of twins since Danny DeVito and Arnold Schwartzenegger, and Cohen doesn't have the face of the glib joke-cracker he portrays, but their acting sells their relationship and the acting of the older performers is even better. A continuity glitch or two is forgiven as the movie packs in enough wit, twists of fate, and characterization for three times its length. 
tt1210351; It's amazing how far Israeli cinematography had come since the 80's "bourekas" movies. This is a new cinematic culture, akin to the best European schools of artistic thought - realistic, brutally honest, simple in its execution and powerful in its message. Goes well with "Nina's tragedies" and "Shlomi's Stars".No need to re-tell it, just rent it and watch it. Allow yourself to feel the pain, enjoy the humor people see in their lives, and appreciate the heroic decisions of very trivial people.Thank you for this movie, Reshef Levy. You made all of us very proud. And very very nostalgic :o)) 
tt0049621;  This excellent thriller is one, if not the only, starring role for Raymond Burr in the movies, one year before he became Perry Mason on TV. Here he is a lawyer too, who brings out the acquittal of his client (Angela Lansbury)accused of murder, only to discover after the verdict, that she really is guilty as hell. Obsessed with his love of Justice, he devises a clever plan to by-pass the double jeopardy immunity, and arranges for her to be caught red-handed after committing another murder... with him as the victim! 
tt0049621; The movie starts with Attorney Craig Carlson dictating the circumstances of his own upcoming murder into a tape recorder. Through a series of flashbacks we find out that he has a problem - his best friend's wife (Lansbury) comes to him for help in a divorce. Then another problem - he falls in love with her. Then another problem - she shoots her husband in self-defense. Now he has to defend her from a murder rap.He gets her acquitted and they get engaged. All is well!! Of course not - why would the movie be over in twenty minutes? Let's just say that his tidy little circumstances rapidly grow complicated. His awareness of his changing situation, and his reaction to it, make for an interesting psychological development.Burr was a good actor and the camera focuses in on his brooding face. It takes a while to find out that Lansbury's performance is more subtle than you might think.The movie is economically directed - witness how the attorney picks up his gun in the opening shots. No dialog, just a brief sequence of visuals, and the plot advances. Well written, with good supporting performances, including a youngish and slim Denver Pyle. Nice unknown movie. 
tt0049621; It's a pity this little (apparently independent?) film noir has not merited a decent restoration and DVD reissue (no one apparently bothered to renew the copyright so scratchy prints were out for a while in 1995 on VHS on "Nostalgia Family Video" and it has been anthologized in a DVD box of "13 Murder Movies"), because the elements in the film are considerably above the "B" film it's usually assumed to be and later work of those involved would be undeniably important. It isn't a great film, but given those elements, it certainly is an interesting one.The basic flashback form of the story telling is an echo almost too close for comfort of 1944's classic DOUBLE INDEMNITY - with the characters dictating the explanation bound for similar fates, in fact, in the film's chief failing, the original ad campaign for PLEASE MURDER ME! gave away virtually every aspect of the plot, leaving audiences only the enjoyment of *how* the characters got where they had been told the characters were going. There were no surprises.Top billed (her first role in that position?) Angela Lansbury was in the middle of a long and (mostly) distinguished movie career mainly playing "bad girls" - years before her Broadway and television career nearly eclipsed her earlier 100+ films - except perhaps for her definitive evil mother in MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE. She appeared to be taking a break from small but important roles in major studio films to see if she could carry a lead herself in this independent. PLEASE MURDER ME! didn't get her major studio leads, but her supporting roles in everything from THE RELUCTANT DEBUTANTE to BLUE HAWAII continued to be either out of the top drawer or she made them seem they were until she decamped for Broadway and the lead in the musical MAME which forever changed HER career.Third billed Dick Foran had had the lead in a wartime revival of Rogers & Hart's A CONNECTICUT YANKEE on Broadway, but had mostly switched over from Hollywood roles in minor films to TV work by this shot at an important role in PLEASE MURDER ME!, but it was RAYMOND BURR, perennial film heavy (his greatest movie role was almost certainly the husband across the way in Hitchcock's REAR WINDOW two years before, who was also working more and more in TV who really made PLEASE MURDER ME! memorable.It is almost certain that it was this role which got Burr his big shot as TV's PERRY MASON the next year. It may even have been a knowing tryout. He was nothing like the 1930's movie Perry Mason, the suave if slightly oily Warren William who was closer to the Perry Mason which Erle Stanley Gardner actually wrote, but watch Burr playing attorney Craig Carlson in PLEASE MURDER ME! It's the full blown Mason 20+ years of TV viewers would get to know intimately. All the mannerisms and line readings are there. Rather than the stock "heavy" which had been Burr's trademark, this was a persona of warmth and trust that anchors the film and makes the slightly strained story believable.One can only hope that one of the ongoing DVD issues of PERRY MASON TV seasons will eventually pick up the public domain PLEASE MURDER ME! as a "bonus" feature - despite Attorney Carlson's position at the final fade out, it clearly belongs as part of the Burr/Mason canon.In the mean time, I'm glad IMDb provides links to the film on the "Internet Archive" for those who can't find one of the PD releases. It's worth a look.Fascinating. 
tt0049621; Don't know where this picture originated. There is no studio at the beginning of the credits and it doesn't look like a TV production, although several of the players went on to successful careers in Television. Besides Burr and Lansbury, John Dehner and Denver Pyle did lots of TV work on many different shows. It also May have been a 'B' from an obscure studio and played with a weak 'A' picture.In any case, the end result is a watchable film well-acted by some old pros and without any outlandish plot device acting as a Deus Ex Machina - surprisingly well-written. The engrossing storyline makes up for some dead time in the middle. Not a bad effort all around. 
tt0049621;  As much as I Like both Burr and Lansbury, I do not like this movie. The only thing that saves this movie, a little bit, is the unique and rarely seen in other movies, plot twist. Once Burr's character realizes that Lansbury's character used him to get acquitted of murder he creates a situation that forces Lansbury's character to kill him, which is his intent all along. I have never seen this type of plot done in another movie and while it is intriguing and the actors do their parts well, The acting doesn't save this movie. It drags and the dragging takes away from the enjoyment.It is a watchable movie, not the worst I have ever seen on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the best, I would rate it a 4. 
tt0049621; Fair little thriller concerns an alleged battered wife (Landsbury) who's supposedly killed her wealthy husband (Foran) in self defence, acquitted of his murder thanks to her romantic liaison with the man's war-time best friend and now eminent attorney (Burr). But Landsbury's gold digging past is about to emerge and Burr concocts an outrageous plan to expose her as a murdering black widow.Decent cast showcases Burr rehearsing the familiar court-room proceedings that would soon matriculate into "Perry Mason" fame, while John Dehner plays a capable DA and Lamont Johnson features in an acting role as Landsbury's artist 'friend' before he turned to directing. You might also notice future "Dukes of Hazzard" Denver Pyle early in the picture as a detective, and then if you're keen-eyed, "Batman"'s 'Aunt Harriet' Madge Blake in a very minor role playing a maid.Economical treatment coasts along leaving little room to properly establish a water-tight plot, generating more than a few contrivances that barely paper over the cracks. Notwithstanding, if you're prepared to overlook a few conveniences "Please Murder Me" still offers a strong cast and mild entertainment for a modest 75 minute investment. 
tt0049621; This is so far fetched. It's from the fall-on-your-sword school of film. Raymond Burr is manipulated by a woman, played by Angela Lansbury, into getting her off for shooting her husband and absconding with his money. Once he knows he's been duped, his whole rationale for existence is to exact revenge on the nasty wench. He is sort of a modern day Javert, putting honor ahead of everything else. In hight drama, we sometimes buy into this. It seems a bit much here. Now, the suicide angle can work to an extent. His actions caused the death of a life-long friend. He also was in love with Lansbury and is left empty. The fact is that no matter what he does to her, he is not going to be there to enjoy it. There are some pretty gaping holes in the plot as well, best laid plans and all that. When so many things could go wrong, a slight miscalculation can bring down the ship. Anyway, it was just a little too much self-sacrifice from my perspective. It's a pretty good looking movie and you can see Perry Mason emerging here, but that's about it. 
tt0049621; So, could this have been Raymond Burr's warm-up for his Perry Mason TV series? Not far out of the realm of possibility I'd say. But if Mason had this kind of dedication to his craft he wouldn't have made it out of the first season. Setting yourself up for a murder is a bit beyond the call of duty I'd say, and the same outcome (snaring Angela Lansbury for it) could have been achieved with a ten minute earlier heads up to the District Attorney (John Dehner). Why didn't he think of THAT?Analyzing this little programmer for more than a few minutes will probably knock down your rating a notch or two, so in that spirit I'll give it a seven. If made today I think a good writer could really make the story a zinger, but you'd have to leave out the part of Attorney Carlson (Burr) admitting in court that he was Myra's (Angela Lansbury) lover. Seems to me that would would have been a strong case for conflict of interest or some other argument along those lines. Why the judge didn't call for a mistrial right then and there was the first thing that crossed my mind.The other thing that gets to me in these early flicks is how quick the newspapermen manage to make it on the scene. By the time Carlson gets to the scene of the crime, there are already four reporters there to cover the story! What kind of a hot line did they have back in the Fifties? Now it pains me to say it, and I'll deny it afterwards, but Angela Lansbury was actually pretty hot back in the day. I know, I know, forget about Jessica Fletcher for a minute and try to be objective. She was a good looking woman who always seemed to play a bad girl in the early days, starting way back in 1944 as the saucy maid in the 1944 remake of "Gaslight". You'd have to say she was a pretty good actress to make you want to hate her the way you wind up doing here. Which is why it's so cool to see the look on her face when the D.A. opens the drawer with the tape recorder. It was a move worthy of 'Murder, She Wrote'. 
tt0049621; This is a small film, in that the stars weren't big-name stars of the day. PLEASE MURDER ME stars Raymond Burr (just before he made it big as Perry Mason), Angela Lansbury and Dick Foran--all capable actors, though hardly starring actors of the day. Despite this lack of star power and an apparent small budget, it's not a bad film--especially when there is a twist and the plot quickly changes about midway through the movie.The film begins as Burr is sitting in his office in the darkness--dictating to a tape recorder that he's about to be murdered. Both the lighting and the idea of a man talking about his impending demise are very much in keeping with a Film Noir piece--as is the direction the film goes in the second half. As for the first half, it starts off with Burr telling his best friend that he has fallen for this friend's wife and wants to marry her! Oddly, instead of punching Burr in the face, the guy says he'll get back with Burr in a few days. However, after a few days, his wife shoots him--claiming he was trying to kill her. Did she do this in self-defense and what will her lawyer (Burr) do? While some of this is a bit predictable, it certainly all isn't and makes for a nifty little film. It's not 100% believable, but given that it's so entertaining, why worry about this? If you are interested in seeing it, it's in the public domain and can be downloaded for free from the IMDb site.By the way, look for Denver Pyle in a small role as a detective testifying in court. It's interesting because Pyle lacks his usual heavy Southern accent and he seems quite at home playing a man living in the big city. 
tt0049621; A wife kills her husband, while she carries on an affair with his best friend who also happens to be a defense attorney. Inexpensive little programmer that would work just as well as a movie made for TV. Still it has a good tight script, with a few twists, and two fine actors. It's Raymond Burr a year before Perry Mason and I expect his courtroom scenes here did a lot to win him the lead in Mason. He carries them off with real authority. Then there's Lansbury as the calculating ice queen, and I stopped counting her smiles after one. She does make a convincing spider woman, however.There's little action, while the courtroom scene takes up a lot of time. Still the plot line is an interesting one of intrigue and misdirection. So there are compensations to the talky format. One does have to wonder, however, about attorney Carlson's (Burr) iron sense of retribution. It appears a key plot contrivance, but an interesting one given the circumstances of his guilt. Should mention, at the same time, the presence of the great John Dehner in the key supporting role of county DA. His is a familiar face from that time, and I don't think he ever turned in a second-rate performance, no matter the role. Anyway, it's highly obscure little movie, but not without compensations. 
tt0069375; A group of shapely girls get stranded near an isolated farmhouse(so far so formulaic)and are given shelter by a young man and his father who inhabit the house. The father wants the girls out, hinting at disaster("Billy, I don't want to be unreasonable, but you know how you get around women...")which of course comes true when the chicks get the axe...literally.Okay, so it looks to be shaping up to be a run-of-the-mill gore film, but insert a love interest for the confounded Billy, a college-dropout-turned-cocktail-waitress, and the love story element is underway. The couple wander through meadows of goldenrod while the girl explains all this(the college drop-out bit)and Billy agrees to invite his new squeeze and her friend to his farm, where there's more talky character development(on the part of the friend, who spouts some kind of florid anti-Vietnam rhetoric in regard to her dead boyfriend)and all the horror of the killings is revealed! And the epilogue is unusual in that it actually gives promise for Billy and his girlfriend's future!Okay, so maybe it's a stretch to say this is a decent movie, but come on, how many gore films even attempt any character development? You almost feel sorry for Billy and his plight. The dialogue leans toward more overripeness than camp, and so the dialogue seems more like TV movie of the week fare than Ed Wood. Still, it is an unusual flick.  
tt0069375;  I long for days when films like Three on a Meat hook painted the screen red. The year 1999 bloodless lame horror films with models and rap singers play your local multi-plexes. I was lucky enough to live through the 70's and 80's to see fun movies like this. Today horror is a shadow of what is used to be. I feel sorry for today's fans who watch such bloodless weak pieces of total garbage like Scream and Halloween H2o and call that horror!! This is horror. Mindless, poorly acted, edited, and basically just a lot of fun. Sorry to dwell on the past so much but Three On a Meat hook represents what will never be seen again thanks to Politically correct morons in today's film world!! Long live 3 on a Meathook!!!! 
tt0069375;  William Girdler's "Three on a Meathook" is obviously inspired by the Ed Gein case.It's a very bizarre tale of a twisted murder and cannibalism in the tradition of Tobe Hooper's "Texas Chain Saw Massacre".There's plenty of nudity and cheesy gore,however the film is not as gory as the title suggests.Still there are some good kill scenes,a good amount of blood plus a nice plot twist at the end.The film is quite slow at times,but its low-budget gives it a raw look.Highly recommended and a good companion piece to "Daddy's Deadly Darling"(1972)-another grainy horror masterpiece from early 70's. 
tt0069375; Ultra-low-budget, skid row version of Psycho lands firmly in the category of so-bad-its-good!Why is it that every time handsome, young Billy brings a girl home that she ends up butchered?One of a number of drive-in horror flicks that William Girdler made in the '70's, this one being fairly memorable. As with many films of its budget, the raw, natural settings add to the moody believability of the picture. James Pickett turns in a decent performance as the films main character, who seems to have some problems indeed. Charles Kissinger plays off well enough as Pickett's odd father. Girdler gives the film a gritty, but nicely moody music score.As with many exploitation films of its day, there's plenty of gore and skin to see. After all, what would you expect from a movie with this memorable title! All in all, Three on a Meathook is a film that's certainly not for all tastes! Fans of the B genre, especially from this era will likely enjoy this horrific and unintentional funny flick.** 1/2 out of **** 
tt0069375;  Titles like this don't come along everyday.Sadly, the title is about the most appealing part if this little 70's oddity.<Spoilers>'Based on the true story of Ed Gein' (someone should really copyright that), it tells the tale of a young man who is accused of doing terrible things by his domineering father, or did he?The main problem with this film is the pacing. Despite its 80 minute run time there is an incredible amount of filler and very little action. The opening quadruple murder flashes by in a .. er .. flash yet a scene featuring characters walking through a field goes on for an age. The worst example however is a scene in which our protagonist goes to a bar to think. While he sits in meditation we are treated to TWO FULL SONGS by the bar band!The whole love interest sub plot does little to enhance the plot and just gives the excuse for more filler.Some credit must be given for the ludicrous ending. Part of the twist is patently guessable though the extra little family secret makes for an amusing surprise.If you're really into your Ed Gein films check out Deranged instead.  
tt0069375;  "Three on a Meathook" has never gained the cult status that the "other" Ed Gein based films have ( hint: "Psycho", "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" ) but is still a pretty decent film.  The budget is three times that of the aformentioned films and the acting is actually pretty tolerable.  There are some pretty delicious amounts of gore, but are few and far between.  Heck the entire middle half of the movie actually tries establishing characters!....which makes the film drag on a bit.  Despite this one flaw "Three on a Meathook" is an entertaining movie but don't go in expecting the sheer ferocity from this like you would from, say, "Texas Chainsaw Massacre".       
tt0069375; Huh. Loosely based on the true story of Ed Gein, huh? How loosely, exactly?Try not even remotely related.Some girls are swimming gleefully naked in front of the camera to open the film, and then we have a broken down car. So, a friendly man allows the girls to stay at his house. And of course, since this was the 70's and everyone was trustworthy, the girls agree.Once they get there, the man's father throws a big fit about how last time he had ladies over, things went, well, not so swimmingly. The son promises his father it won't happen again. But of course, it does.So naturally, the father tries to help cover things up. And tries to convince the son that he's responsible. Meanwhile, the son starts falling in love with one of the girls. Wow. That happened fast.And of course, in the end, there's a twist. But it's kind of stupid. There's only six characters in the film and based on the title, three of them are dead! Of course, the title is kind of lying. When the remaining girl opens the barn, she does find three, but on three different meat hooks. I guess the title "Three On Three Meathooks" didn't sound nearly as catchy, huh?So these girls aren't used for furniture, they weren't dug up from graves, and no one wore their skin. So just out of curiosity, I wonder if this has even the slightest to do with Ed Gein. I'm gonna say no. 
tt0069375; I don't really have anything to add that isn't already posted in the comment section for this movie. I am just going to summarize things that others have said that I agree with.This is a gritty, low-budget exploitation movie with a 70's feel. You will notice similarities to Psycho and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and supposedly it is inspired by the same true-life serial killer. It has some gore and nudity, and quite a bit of slow-moving filler. If you are bothering to track this movie down, you probably already have seen several like it and know what to expect.The plot involves an isolated farm boy who lives with his father. When the movie begins, four young ladies are traveling to his neck of the woods for a girls-only camping trip. Their car breaks down and he invites them to stay at his place, where he lives with his dad. Twenty minutes into the movie, and all four girls are dead.I really had to keep watching to see what else the director would do for the rest of this full-length movie after accomplishing what most movies would take their entire running time to do. Instead of following the formula, this one switches things up and has the boy head into town to drink away his troubles. It seems he murdered the girls without realizing what he was doing, and apparently this was not the first time something like this happened. The shot of the young killer walking down the neon-light street with his hands in his pockets seems to suggest Peter Parker more than a pick-ax murderer. Luckily, he gets drunk and an attractive bartender takes him home, because that's what girls did in the seventies, isn't it? They end up getting along, and he invites her to stay at his farm. She accepts, and it looks like the horror will occur all over again.I usually never even try to figure how movies are going to end, but I saw where this one was going VERY early on. It contains most of the elements of trashy 70's horror, such as a weird, repetitive "score," poor acting, ridiculous dialog, a grainy yet naturalistic look, and retro fashions. In the middle of the movie, there is a band playing in the bar where the main character goes to drink, and we watch them play two entire songs as if they were the musical guests on an episode of SNL. The movie is unintentionally funny, and I had to find something else to do during long stretches where very little was happening. However, as a fan of these sorts of curiosities, I enjoyed the experience overall, at least upon my first viewing. I don't think I could sit through it again.I also want to say that I have seen the last movie this director made, titled Manitou. It is actually pretty impressive to see the progress he made in the time between these two movies. I was saddened to learn that he died at a young age after only six years of writing and directing horror movies. He seems like he was on track to becoming a very prolific filmmaker. 
tt0069375;  (Potential Spoilers)Although many might find the grindingly low-budgeted movie pretty tedious, it is much preferable to director William Girdler's later big-budget 70's horror movies (i.e. Grizzly, Day of the Animals, The Manitou)because at least here he isn't wasting a lot of money or any otherwise-talented name actors. This under-budgeted waste of time starts out without a couple of scenes that put the "gratuitous" in "gratuitous nudity". It then gets going with the story of three "coeds"  (do they let people this stupid into college?)who take refuge in an old farm house after their car breaks down. The farm house is occupied by a weird son and even weirder father. One of the girls unaccountably falls in love with the son while the rest. . . well, they don't call it Three on a Meathook for nothing. The surprise killer isn't really all that surprising as there are only two possible suspects. Not very good, but you could do worse I guess. 
tt0069375;    What makes "Three on a Meathook" a balls-out real horror film? It's the fact that it looks like a home movie a serial killer would make. It looks like, after finding a 16mm camera in one of his victim's houses, some serial killer got a few of his demented buddy's together, put some ad in the paper for cheap talent, and tried to make a movie. In one of the earliest scenes where the father is berating the son you can see that, although the actors keep screwing up their lines they kept filming and left it in the final print. The grainy stock of the film, the inventive although cheap special effects, and the down-trodden feel of this picture really put you into the subconscious pocket of something brewing in a crude psychopath's mind. Scene after scene is dragged out mercilessly as the filmmakers try to fill the legal feature-length time. One scene has the son sitting in a bar watching the band AMERICAN XPRESS play through two lackluster 70's contemporary tunes. This had me wondering what ever happened to American Xpress, the band featured in some serial killer's home movie "Three on a Meathook"? I wont spoil the end for you, but I will say that you do not watch this movie with the expectation of being entertained: you watch it to experience something a blood-letter would dream. 
tt0116977;  I read the comments before seeing this flick, but I disagree. This film is effective in its combination of a reasonable plot, worthy acting, a good cast, and violent as well as soft segments. The two roles played by Jennifer Tilly were believable. Michael Madsen did a great job as the thoughtful tough guy. Also, the theme of loyalty or lack thereof gave the film more meaning.  
tt0116977;  This is modern, skeleton Noir. Within that framework, it is certainly viewable, with Tilly a standout as the femme fatal. In monochrome color, first-person narrative flashback, a jazzy soundtrack, interesting camerawork, and betrayal themes, it appears as a true genre piece. Unfortunately, the script plus the filmmakers' glint toward Schwarzenegger-like action, ruin any dark ambiance they establish. It's all here: the tough but soft-hearted hero, viperous femme, over-the-top bad guy, the black sidekick slated for torture/death. And it all rapidly blows away like gunsmoke during the cartoonish shootouts.Madsen is in typical Rourke-mode, but with a little more compassion squinting his eyes. Tilly is all whiskey-throated slur as Rina and little-girl whine as Cathy. The movie definitely needs more of Rina, because, with the exception of Busey's Wild Man, she's the cast's only interest. The giveaway is in the prologue, where, in sepia-tone, slow-mo, and voice-over narrative, Madsen labors his death scene, blazing away with dual, silver-toned guns and a monotone from a mortally-wounded script. Ultimately, it boils down to the bullets and body count, without enough desperation or resignation to warrant the blood. 
tt0116977;  I rented this movie because I like both the leads, namely, Michael Madsen and Jennifer Tilly. Well, they (along with Robert Loggia and Gary Busey) play to type, the cynical but thoughtful man with a gun and the female fatale that you would not want to cross. The problem is that this movie is basically all atmosphere without much of a story to make it that interesting. Madsen is a world weary hitman who has a conscience -- he can't kill Tilly's innocent twin (Tilly as an innocent is almost worth the price of the rental), so he protects her no matter how dangerous it might be. Loggia and Busey complete the typecasting as mob members, Busey giving his typical performance as a bit of a nut. It is probably worth the price of the rental for fans of the genre (I guess film noir fits) and the stars, but it all seemed by the numbers to me. Madsen in particular deserves better roles -- you are better off checking out "House in the Hills" 
tt0116977; Michael Madsen, Jennifer Tilly, Gary Busey, and Robert Loggia, are totally wasted in this film, mainly because the script reads like it went through a blender. Characters appear out of nowhere with zero development. You've seen it all before, only there perhaps it made a little bit of sense. I mean, Michael Madsen knows Jennifer Tilly's Sister for about fifteen minutes and falls for her. People show up in locations for gun-play, with you the viewer, having no idea how they knew how to get there. Forget the fine cast, skip this movie, and avoid wearing out your finger with the fast forward button. You have been warned. - MERK 
tt0097435; Possibly one of the most haunting novels I've ever read, the movie while good isn't at all in the same league as the novel. This is the same problem another movie, "The other side of Midnight" had but that was actually better. Girl on a swing would be an awfully tough book to make into a movie and have it be flawless, the book simply was to atmospheric(mostly accomplished by incredible writing that the movie could not match).The main problem of this movie is that it kind of evolves into a horror. This book was never meant to be a "horror", more a combination Romance, thriller, mystery, ghost story all in one. The book is a riveting, heartbreaking piece of work, the movie is merely creepy. Doesn't even begin to capture the essence of Kaithe or Allen, relies more on the fear factor.(I'm not saying it's bad, actually it's good, just not in the same league as the book.)Spoilers :don't read on unless you want to know.The book didn't give anything away, I really, when reading it had no idea what would happen page by page. In the movie you kind of know what Kaithe's "secret" is going to be. Although I was delirious with joy to find the movie version of one of my all time favorite books I wish the compelling dreaminess of the book had been captured and that it had moved me more.I doubt many people would see this movie and call it "remarkable". Yet the book was. It told of the incredible love one man had for this woman and the terrible choice she made that doomed both of them as well as others. You might like the movie better if you don't read the book first but in any event I disagree with many that Meg Tilly didn't do a good job, she did all right. So my overall review is-good movie-amazing book. 
tt0097435;  The movie wasn't a masterpiece.  But it was worth the time spent watching it.  Whether it was intentional or not, the movie's slightly off-kilter tempo and underdeveloped story line gave it an eerie, life-like feeling. The interactions between Karin and Alan reminded me of having an interesting conversation with someone you just met.  You spend hours laughing, exploring the world's fascinations and revealing intimate details about yourself, but after the conversation ends, you really can't recall anything about the other person, you're left wanting for more.  I suppose because I hadn't read the book I had no expectations about it.  To me, the movie was about a man who simply marries uncertainty.  Alan never really knew Karin completely. Similar to life, we never really know everything about Karin, where she was from or what was going on inside her head.  We had vague glimpses, but nothing concrete.  Do you really know your spouse?  I mean, really?  We are always off-guard, we could never quite grab hold of Karin.  I admit the movie was hard to watch, but I had this desire to finish it out.  After it was over, I wanted more, like the starving man who eats the meager portions on his plate.  He doesn't really care who made his meal or what is in it, but he knows he'll need more of it.  Also, about Meg Tilley's much maligned German accent.  She didn't deliver the stereotypical Marlene Dietrich or Colonel Klink accent, she sounds like the some of the real Germans I know here in the west side of Germany.  
tt0097435; For some mysterious reason which I shall never understand, the inspired and brilliant actress Meg Tilly has never achieved appropriate recognition for her amazing talent. This is one of her finest films, and yet it has never even been released as a DVD. I had to obtain a rare and expensive old VHS video of it, and even that was a 'screening copy for promotional purposes only', so that I wonder if even that was ever properly released. The film also contains what may well have been the finest performance by Rupert Frazer, who subsequently did most of his work for television, and has also been under-appreciated. Meg Tilly's performance in this film is so outstanding that it really is in a category of its own, far exceeding anything one would ever expect to see on screen. The history of the cinema is full of charmers and sirens, and many of the world's most beautiful women are there to be seen by one and by all. But sometimes on very rare occasions, something so special happens, someone so far excels the norm, that it is like a miracle. This is one of those occasions. As RA©my de Gourmont pointed out, the mediaeval poet Goddeschalk made an essential point when he wrote: 'You love in order to make yourself beautiful.' Here this is exquisitely portrayed by Meg Tilly, whose intense and passionate love for Rupert Frazer transforms her and makes her far more beautiful than she would normally be. We can see these physical changes take place in her in front of our very eyes. This is a magical transfiguration, like being witness to an act of sheer witchcraft. The film is excellently and sensitively directed by Gordon Hessler, who is now in his 80s and who retired from directing in 1991. There is excellent support from Nicholas Le Prevost, Lynsey Baxter, Helen Cherry (Trevor Howard's wife, in her last feature film), and others. But this film is essentially a story of love obsession between two people, into which a most devastating tragedy has intruded. The 'girl in a swing' is at the same time both a rare piece of porcelain depicting a girl on a swing, and Meg Tilly herself, whose apotheosis as a kind of incarnation of Aphrodite takes place in the garden when she has been swinging, with nothing on but a hat. There is a supernatural dimension to this film which only becomes clear towards the latter part of the story. Meg Tilly's character has been a girl of mystery from the beginning of the story, and the mystery only deepens and deepens. Rupert Frazer plays a very old-fashioned young Englishman of the sort who does not really exist anymore. He meets her in Copenhagen, she has an obscure or non-existent 'background', but they marry and she moves to England where they live for a while idyllically in his country house. The film is based upon a novel by Richard Adams. Much of it is set in Wiltshire, with several scenes taking place upon the great White Horse which is carved into the hilltop at Westbury, seen several times in magnificent aerial shots, along with lush shots of the sweeping green hills and fields of the West Country. The film has so much atmosphere that it crackles. The film would probably have failed if it were not for the central performance by Meg Tilly, as everything depends upon her being utterly convincing, and not many actresses could have summoned up the magic to become a naiad or dryad right before our bedazzled eyes in the way that she does. This film really is in a category of its own, a classic which has been entirely forgotten, or more probably was never recognised in the first place. How can the bewitching Meg Tilly possibly have been swept to one side as she was in her career, in favour of hordes of inferior actresses? I first saw her when Milos Forman's VALMONT (1989) was released a year after this film, and I thought she was extraordinary then. But this enthralling performance ranks with the greatest portrayals of a mysterious romantic woman in any film, in my opinion. The ultimate mysteries are those of the heart, as this film so magnificently and entrancingly reminds us. 
tt0097435; Well, I liked this one a lot. To be sure, I was not shocked by the big revelation at the end, but I'm not at all sure I was supposed to be. I knew nothing of the film going in, so had no idea I was in for a bit of a ghost story. Meg Tilly was so beautiful. Easy to see why Alan Dresland (Frazer) would fall for her. I thought she utterly nailed this role. The secretiveness, the blossoming love, the creepy aura of something not quite right coming out, well, she knocked all of these out of the park. A lot has been made of her German accent in this role. It sounded fine to me. Granted, I'm a Texan, and speak no German (or Danish) at all.Yes I missed some of her dialogue, but I always miss a little of what people say in accented English. (OK, in a different accent than mine) She was fantastic, and I'm sorry I haven't seen more of her over the years. 
tt0097435; but that would imply Ebert, Maltin, et al. are morons. And that's not what I intend to write about. ,-)This film is one of my favorites because it deals with animistic archetypes as living essences of Nature- and they're all around us all the time, even in our stultified modern lives......invisible to all. It's really perfectly pagan with a dash of the ancient gods, nymphs, etc., which is what the Girl really is- like Venus born of the foam of the Sea- and hints at exactly what Powers lie sleeping within...all of us. Our hero, Alan is a typical well-behaved English plodder, utterly predictable and boring, even a boring name- with only one passion- and it isn't love- or so he thinks. It is for his antique business and finding obscure and rare pieces. Like Ali Baba, he does just that, and somehow unleashes a Genie that in turn will unleash the passionate, loving Man lurking, sleeping in him- which will awaken him from his walking sleep.It's been a good 10 years since I've seen this film. I hope it is available in DVD at some point. It really is a superb piece of work. 
tt0097435;  It could have been a great movie, all the elements were there: an interesting story, intriguing characters, beautiful landscapes. Yet something was missing. Inspiration and talent, maybe? For two hours I was waiting for this movie to surprise me (you can guess what the mystery is rather quickly) and move me, and was disappointed. I wonder if anyone is thinking of remaking it... 
tt0097435; Having read Richard Adams' book I was very much looking forward to seeing this movie, and was fortunate enough to find an old VHS rental copy of it. Whilst deviating somewhat from the books plot it still manages to retain much of its original premise. The acting on the whole is good although Meg Tilly's German accent tends to be annoying at times. It certainly kept me in enthralled as the mystery gently unfolds. If your expecting a standard Hollywood Ghost story then this is not it. In stead it relies on subtlety and underlying dread to unveil it's secrets. I would definitely recommend this film. Pity there is no DVD release imminent. 
tt0097435;  "The Girl in a Swing" is nicely filmed in worldwide locales, but the director plays too much with the limits of the audience's patience. Yes, the transition from conventional romance to psychological-supernatural thriller has to be done methodically, but the pacing of this film is TORTUROUSLY slow. The plot only starts picking up after about 80 minutes. And although the main reason for the heroine's "unstable" behavior IS finally revealed (in fact, you may have already guessed it by then), other details (for example, the man's hallucinations) remain unresolved. Both leads are well-cast....but oh, that Meg Tilly's obnoxious, overdone German accent!     (**) 
tt0097435;  Alan Desland is a cultivated English bachelor who has taken over his family's antique porcelain business.  On a business trip to Copenhagen, he meets and immediately falls in love with Karin, a stunning German beauty. After only a couple of weeks they marry, honeymoon, and settle into life in Alan's hometown.  At first their erotically charged relationship seems like paradise, but this, of course, cannot last.  Karin has told Alan virtually nothing of her past, and her dark secret eventually manifests with supernatural trappings and threatens everything."The Girl in a Swing" is based on the 1980 novel by Richard "Watership Down" Adams.  The film has one thing going for it, the script does an admirable job of lining up and hitting a good number of the novel's main plot points and scenes.  Otherwise, this overwrought melodrama has little to recommend it.There is so much to criticize--from the passionless direction to the insipid soundtrack, awful costuming, and poor casting.  Meg Tilly in the role of Karin is particularly troublesome.  While she is a fairly attractive woman, she does not project the sort of unearthly eroticism that the character requires.  Worse, her muddled, affected German accent obscures most of her dialogue.  When Tilly isn't screeching "Alan!" she is mumbling and slurring her most important lines.  Director Gordon Hessler does little to salvage things, as he opts to film most of the important supernatural and erotic sequences in one of two modes--either flat or melodramatic.While very few films adapted from novels can attain the dense subtext of their source material, such a film might at least evoke the essence of the story by establishing a strong mood consistent with the novelist's vision. This film, however, aspires to nothing so worthy.  It neither succeeds as an adaptation of Adams' complex novel nor as a worthy cinematic effort in its own right.   
tt0097435;  I remember the buzz about this movie when it came out.  The sexuality, the ethereal, metaphysical theme.  Sounds intriguing, no?  Therefore I was surprised to see Maltin call it "unwatchable" and "a stinker".  That was all before I watched it.  Now that I have, I tend to agree with Leonard. Ebert's review is interesting because he "didn't get it" either, and seemed to say that the movie had accomplished something by puzzling him.  You're too kind, Roger.  This could have been a great movie.  Each scene was well shot.  Unfortunately, the whole was less than the sum of its parts.  I was going to blame the Director but perhaps the Editor was more to blame.  The faults: 1) the mystery, when revealed, didn't ring true. 2) the sex was totally un-erotic. 3) the visions were confusing and hokey. 4) [perhaps most annoying of all] All of Meg Tilly's lines were delivered in a whisper and with a horrible attempt at a german accent, 50% of her dialog was unintelligible.  
tt1646118; The film is called October because its action takes place during this month when the faithful people of Lima pray to the Lady of Miracles for a little help with their more, or even more modest lives. I must confess, this is the first Peruvian film I have ever seen and I was very impressed. Everything from plot to camera work to acting and to capturing the local element was - in my opinion - first class. The film has heart and it has (quite subtle) humour too. It has realism but it has hope too. The characters are well defined, no good guys or bad guys, just a bunch of human beings living their lives hoping for their break - in many cases amounting to a miracle. Their lives are not easy but this is far from a sad film. Somehow you end up liking the heroes (more like anti-heroes), feeling for them and eagerly waiting to see what is going to happen next. No Bruce Willis fighting mighty terrorists here but rather human beings fighting their condition, their conditioning and whatever life throws at them. Yes, miracles do happen all around us, but some of us recognize them, while others are just incapable to. Heart-warming film! (I have just re-read this review. My words don't do it justice. Go and see the film!) 
tt1646118; So it's my understanding that this film was a Jury Prize winner at Cannes. I would really hate to see the losing entries. Continuing on with the liner notes, the film is described as a 'deadpan dark comedy', but in my estimation, only the term 'dark' describes it adequately. Now there are only two other reviews of the picture on this forum as I write this, and both of them give a fairly positive view of what transpires in the story. I actually found those reviews well done and respectful of the picture, and I don't intend to be negative here, but this one simply did not do it for me. The principal characters were one dimensional and lifeless, and Clemente (Bruno Odar) was about the saddest example of humanity you're likely to see in any film. Squalid conditions permeating every scene throughout the story make it difficult to convince that there's supposed to be some uplifting message to be found. As an illustration, I'm pretty sure I've never seen a guy clip his toenails in a movie before, or get beaten up by a taxi driver because there was something wrong with his intended payment. I'm sure the desired effect of the picture is supposed to be one of Clemente finding his own humanity among the dregs of Peruvian society, but making his way throughout the entire story without even cracking a smile convinced me he was more of a hopeless case than ever. I'm perfectly willing to let others have their positive view of this picture, but for me it would take a Lord of Miracles to convince me to watch it again. 
tt1646118; Clemente, a Peruvian money lender, conducts business out of his shabby house in Lima. He is visited mainly by poor people hoping to be lent some badly needed money, which they might not even repay, to get them out of a tough spot they are facing. Clemente, armed with his jeweler's lens, analyzes the merchandise he is brought to pawn. Depending on the object they bring, they might get, or not, the cash needed.Clemente is a solitary man who lives frugally. Just by watching him eat, one gets the impression he is a man that does not want to spend too much on himself. Something he has no problem is going to satisfy his sexual desires with local prostitutes. He has one woman who sees him on occasion. Once his need is met, he has no use for the woman. One day a baby girl is left at his house. Clemente is puzzled as to how the infant came to being there. Going to the police, he is told by an unsympathetic cop to try to do his best for the baby, something he is not prepared to do, much less has any knowledge about how to treat the baby. His solution comes in the form of Sofia, a client, who wants to pawn something. She realizes the baby is suffering from a rash that keeps her crying in discomfort.Sofia, a devout woman to the cult of the Lord of Miracles, names the little girl Milagritos, (little miracle), offering herself to tend to the baby, who immediately stops crying. Sofia, a woman of a certain age, sees in Clemente the man she never was able to get on her own. So she begins to explore the possibility of being part of his life, even getting in bed with him to caress him while he sleeps, but never having intercourse with the man. Sofia relies in a kind of sorcery, a love potion, if you will, in which she takes her underwear in water that she then serves to Clement, to get him to want her, without much luck.Clemente learns the possibility that Milagritos is the daughter of a known prostitute. Going after her proves to be more difficult than he thought. Ultimately, he gets beat up when he goes to a dangerous part of Lima to see the woman. Returning home, Clemente is in a sour state and he wants Sofia out of the house. Gradually, he realizes how much Sofia meant to his well being, as well as that of Milagritos. It is October, the month of the Lord of Miracles and Clemente knows what to do. He gets into the mob attending the procession of the holy figure trying to locate the woman whose hex appears to finally work on him."October" a surprising entry by Peruvian creators, Daniel and Diego Vega Vidal, making their full length film with it, show two talented men making a marvelous debut. Their lonely pawnbroker is a man living a routine more than having a life. The baby seems to be a distraction from his dreary existence, in a way, a complication he did not bargain for. Clemente cannot commit to any one person. When Sofia enters the picture, the problem with the baby is taken care, but preferring to spend time with his prostitutes, he does not see the goodness in a woman who is ready to offer him a stability he never knew. Clemente is facing a difficult time in his life, but he is too obtuse to see the light until it is too late.Bruno Odar, the taciturn Clemente in the film, captures the essence of his character in a nuanced performance about the lonely man he is portraying. Gabriela Velasquez is a spinster, a woman who has not experienced love and sees Clemente as her salvation, but only gets his rejection. Fergan Chavez Ferrer, the cinematographer, gets the dreary atmosphere around a poor section of Lima to fit well within the narrative. The music score is by Oscar Camacho.One could only wish Daniel and Diego Vega Vidal a great career in their future work. 
tt0064470; This truly is the father of modern day Power Rangers, Star Blazers and much,much more. Not only does this have great US actors, but has all the classical features we now see in everyday television and movies. Example: People dressed up in Bat creature costumes, Flying submarines, etc. In contrast to todays movies with would seem to be rather lame, but overall if you take the total context of what is being shown you'll love it. It is not every day that you see great actors interacting with special effects creatures and under the direction of a great Japanesse director. Remember this try as you might you can not see this movie today due to it's being shelved back in Japan. I have tried to obtain it, tried to get various TV stations to play it all to no avail. 
tt0064470;  Another memory from my childhood! I was about 7 or 8 years old when I saw this film and it really freaked me at this time! Recently, I watched "Ido zero daisakusen" again and it had great nostalgia-values!! Giant rats, bat-like creatures... this flick directed by GodzillaÂ´s spiritual father Ishiro Honda has everything a great Japanese monster movie needs! Plus the great performances of Richard Jaeckel, who made some extraordinary alien-experiences in "The Green Slime" as well as Cesare Romero, unforgettable as sneering bad guy Joker in the 1960s Batman-series! The biggest surprise however was the appearance of Joseph Cotten, an actor that also starred in the Orson Welles-classic "Citizen Kane" or Carol ReedÂ´s "The 3rd Man"... so heÂ´s next to Russ Tamblyn or Raymond Burr a further US-actor who can add a Japanese Sci-fi movie to his filmography. "Atragon II" may be a little bit cheesy compared to nowadayÂ´s standard (Which Asian monster flick from those days is not?!?), but all the multimillion Dollar CGI-F/X canÂ´t deal with the great naive charm this film delivers! A cult classic!!! 
tt0064470; Interesting note: "Suitamation" acting Legend Harou Nakajima play the Winged Lion in this Film, Nakajima was Godzilla for the first 20 years of Godzilla Movies, He also portrayed such Giant Monster legends as, Rodan, Varan, Mougera (The Mysterians) and the front section of Mothra.That's what I love so much about this film, what other Movie can have the same actors that portrayed Godzilla & the Joker in the same scene!I agree with the above Review, I have been a Daikaijuologist my whole life, and have seen just about every suitamation film Toho ever made, the suit work and miniatures in Latitude Zero have no rival & this is INDEED one of Toho's most underrated works. 
tt0064470;  Scientists are descending in bathyspere when an underwater volcano erupts. They are saved by a submarine commander on his futuristic sub the Alpha who takes them to a mystical and wonderful place named Latitude Zero, where the adventure is this action packed Japanese film begins.  
tt0064470;  As was the norm in the 60's, Japanese filmmakers used old-time American actors to help market their films in the US and Europe. Such Hollywood classics such as Raymond Burr ("Godzilla"), Nick Adams and Robert Horton ("The Green Slime") made a second career by appearing in Japanese sci -fi.Joseph Cotton ("Citizen Kane"), Cesar Romero (TV "Batman's" original Joker) and Richard Jaeckel ("The Dirty Dozen", "Spenser:For Hire", "The Green Slime"), were another three who appeared in this offbeat blend of sci-fi and fantasy.Cotten has his hands full as a Captain Nemo-esque commander of the super sub Alpha (an odd coincidence, since he later played the famous submariner in MGM's "Captain Nemo and the Underwater City"), fighting against a mad scientist (Romero) with a penchant for splicing together mutant creatures to rule the world. Jaeckel plays the reporter tossed into this crazy conflict, which has little or no plot or character development, but is just your average no-brainer popcorn flick perfect for the fanboy in all of us.A strange twist was the marketing of this film as a sequel to the live action version of the anime movie "Atragon", another super sub movie that bears absolutely no resemblance in design or plot to "Latitude Zero". 
tt0064470; This is one of the finest of the non-Godzilla epics by Ishiro Honda and Toho. It definitely has all the elements that make for a great film great story, great action and an interesting twist at the end. What really stands out is the fact that Honda pretty much took a near impossible situation in working with several American actors who didn't speak Japanese and was able to do a decent job in directing them. However, the thing that really was interesting about this film was the fact that this film marks what probably is the first and only time that Akira Takarada and the late, great Akihiko Hirata are heard speaking English with their own voices after years of being dubbed. This film is definitely one of the finest to come from Toho. 
tt0064470; Irwin Allen's 1978 Captain Nemo featured old time Hollywood stars - Jose Ferrer and Batman's Burgess Meredith - doing battle with each other in studio-tank-bound submarines with memorable music scoring the show. Latitude Zero (1969) has old time Hollywood stars - Cotten and Batman's Romero - doing battle with each other in studio-tank-bound submarines with memorable music scoring the show! However, the middle sections of Latitude Zero are set in an underwater city with no subs to be seen, but still, those early scenes of Zero are very Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea/Nemo-ish, in fact I almost felt like I discovered some long lost Irwin Allen production when recently viewing Latitude Zero for my first time! The colourful lines given to Cotten and Romero are what stand out the most in my memory, the only real negative point of the film is the brain transplant scene which would disturb some kid viewers, this is a child-like film, did we need that moment of horror in it? Irwin Allen would not of done a "too grim" scene like that if he produced this movie. But the flying submarine would of thrilled Irwin...as would the explosions.As for the submarines, we mostly see a small but flashy control room, the subs don't compare to the submarine Seaview, but the sub miniature effects of Latitude Zero are pleasing when shown with that loud music playing over it...and the acting from the leads is priceless (you will never think of Cotten the same way again).This is a hard movie to get but I hear the film was released on DVD - somewhere - in 2006. Also, the film's music is on CD. Cotten would appear in Irwin Allen's City Beneath The Sea (1971) shortly after this, but sounding less thrilled than he was in Latitude Zero. 
tt0064470;  Nothing against Godzilla, but I think that this movie is Toho's best and very under rated. It's almost impossible to buy in North America. There is major high-tech sub action, multi-weapon gloves and really cool 60's sci-fi effects up the wazoo. The humor and acting are up to the usual Toho standards. If your vintage sci-fi nerd (like me), you'll love it! 
tt0064470; This is a bigger budgeted film than usual for genre director Honda (with more evidently elaborate sets) Â<U+0096> though the special effects still have that distinctive cheesiness to them (witness the giant bats and rodents on display). It also utilizes a surprising number of American actors: Joseph Cotten playing the visionary scientist looks ill-at-ease and frail (but, then, his character is supposed to be 204 years old!), an innocuous Richard Jaeckel is the photographer hero while, as chief villains, we get Cesar Romero and Patricia Medina (both essentially campy). As I've often said, I grew up watching English-language films dubbed in ItalianÂ but hearing Hollywood actors in Japanese is another thing entirely! LATITUDE ZERO feels like a juvenile version of a typical Jules Verne adventure, and is fairly entertaining on that level, indeed, it's preferable to Honda's low-brow variations on the monsters-on-the-rampage formula because of the inherent quaint charm of the set-up in this case. The plot involves the kidnapping of a famous scientist by Romero Â<U+0096> he was intended to establish himself in the underwater, technologically advanced city devised by Cotten (to which the world's foremost minds are being recruited). We're treated to plenty of silly battles between the rival subs, but the most amusing scenes are certainly the raid on Romero's cave Â<U+0096> in fact, Cotten doing somersaults and fending off men in rubber suits (via flames and laser emitted from his glove!) must surely count as the nadir of his acting career, the other elder in the cast, Romero, is more in his element Â<U+0096> after all, he had been The Joker in the BATMAN TV series and movie of the 1960s! Cotten has a scantily-clad blonde physician on his team, and is assisted by a hulking Asian, Romero, on the other hand, is flanked by an Oriental femme fatale Â<U+0096> who, however, ends up getting a raw deal for her efforts (the girl's brain is eventually transplanted into a hybrid of lion and condorÂ which is among the phoniest-looking creatures you ever saw!). Apparently, a 2-disc set of this one from Media Blasters streets on this very day!! 
tt0064470; I bought this movie only to make my Toho movie collection more complete. A very different Toho film, where we have actors Joseph Cotton and Akira Takarada as the leads, journeying into another world and another dimension below the sea, where everybody seemed to be living in peace. But, the peace is threaten by a mad scientist, played by Cesar Romero. Monsters appear in this film, in the form of gigantic rats and lions.This movie is somewhat dull and not as exciting as earlier Toho sci-fi movies of the 60s. The monster scenes and human characters were dull. To the casual sci-fi viewer, this movie would probably be a good viewing pleasure. But to the faithful Toho sci-fi fans, this movie does not quite cut it. It does have some action in it, but it is just a far departure from the usual Toho. Grade D 
tt0077797; You can simply say its just another flick with humor and it actually suggests you to do so but you cant rate it as an average film. why? because of its simplicity it touches you. There are no melodramatic scenes characters are near to reality one can connect with the theme and watching Late Mr. Ashok Kumar is a treat. Mr Deven Verna's performance attracts.His song Mummi O Mummi tu kab saas banegi is very good. another song from Thoda hai Thode ki zaroorat hai by Late Mr Kishor Kumar is good to listen. Film is based on Indian Parsi families and shows there life style in brief. Rakesh Roshan and Bindiya Goswami is OK. I gave 8 ranking for it. If you are interested in light comedy it is for you Go & Watch!! 
tt0077797; Khatta Meetha is one of those movies that you simply enjoy. It is not a movie that has to be understood or deeply ruminated about. It is one of those movies which were a part of the uncomplicated movies made in the 70s in India.The movie has its share of emotions and comedy. They mix with each other and do not launch an attack on your sensibilities, cinematic or otherwise.Some of the best comic work, I have ever seen, especially from Preeti Ganguly, the real life daughter of Ashok Kumar. Her fantasy sequences of getting married with Amitabh Bachhan (dressed as a Parsee, no less) are to be seen to be believed! Another scene worth remembering is her "Kheer" sequence with Master Raju.There is a typical rich-girl-poor-boy track that runs parallel to the main movie, and a lesser director would have taken the movie in a tangent, but it is so well woven in the main track, that it actually complements the whole effort.The song "Thoda Hain Thode Ki Zaroorat Hai" (We have little and we need little else..) is beautiful, probably in the top 10 works of Kishoreda. The title track is good. One song, "Mummy..O..Mummy" is hilarious. Others are forgettable. 
tt0077797; Khatta Meetha (sour sweet) is the tale that lays out the sweetness of love in life that enables the human-beings to endure the unavoidable sourness of experiences. Being a take on the Hollywood movie - Yours, Mine and Ours (1968), the story takes shape with the marriage of two lonely senior citizens - Homi Mistry (Ashok Kumar) and Nargis Sethna (Pearl Padamsee). Since both of them are having grown up children, their union in life results in their families too joining to make an extended family. Their children are not happy with the marriage of their (respective) father and mother. Quarrels take place between them with the parents (half biological and half legal) trying to patch up the things and keep the family united. Nargis' son Feroze (Rakesh Roshan) falls in love with Zarine (Bindiya Goswami) who is the daughter of an egoist businessman (Pradeep Kumar) who is mentally not prepared to allow his daughter to marry an ordinary youth and become daughter-in-law of an ordinary middle-class family. He takes steps to harass the family so that the family itself doesn't accept Zarine. However in the end, he himself has to bow before the strength of love within the family and conviction of its head - Homi Mistry that nothing can become a wall in the path of the happiness of his family.Khatta Meetha is a signature movie of Basu Da. Each and every frame of the movie and each and every character of the story seems familiar to the typical Indian spectator who comes from the salaried middle class living a normal life but dreams big. I have a great regard for the Paarsi community who despite being a minority community in India, has never begged for any privileges and instead contributed immensely for the growth of the country. It's a community which has always taken interest in giving something to the society and the nation instead of demanding. Regretfully (and unjustifiably), the Bollywood filmmakers have mocked this community in the Hindi movies. Khatta Meetha is a welcome change from this defective Bollywood tradition. It has shown the Paarsi characters of the movie like normal flesh and blood human-beings like the other communities and presented an authentic account of their life. Basu Da did the same thing later for the Christian community also in Baaton Baaton Mein (1979).Khatta Meetha can be considered a comedy because it tickles and entertains. However it is not a slapstick comedy and creates natural laughs and smiles in the audience. The comedy of the movie is not forced on the spectators, it is felt by them. And the sentiments embedded in the story are also felt by them in equal manner because there is nothing that can be considered as over the top. The viewer feels his heart beating for the members of the extended family and his eyes getting humid over their sufferings. The viewer laughs with them and weeps for them.Finally, it's a great movie because it propagates the ages old Indian philosophy of non-accumulation and echoes Mahatma Gandhi's watchword of simple living and high thinking through the presentation of the story and the immortal song of Kishore Kumar and Lata Mangeshkar - Thoda Hai, Thode Ki Zaroorat Hai, Zindagi Phir Bhi Yahaan Khoobsurat Hai (we have little and we need little, nevertheless the life is beautiful here). A great lesson for all and sundry.All the performers in the movie have done well including Ranjeet Chaudhary, Ravi Raj, Devendra Khandelwal, Vimal Sahu, Preeti Ganguly, Master Raju, Pradeep Kumar, Deven Varma, Piloo Waadia, David, Keshto Mukherjee, Bindiya Goswami etc. Today's superstar Hrithik Roshan's father - Rakesh Roshan could not become a big hero in his time but he was successful in carving a niche for him as well as creating his fan-following through such simple, low budget and heart-winning movies. However the performer who stand tallest are Ashok Kumar and Pearl Padamsee being the senior citizen couple. Dada Muni (Ashok Kumar) has delivered a mesmerizing performance and Pearl Padamsee has rubbed shoulders with him step by step. It's a treat to watch the performance of these stalwart artists on the screen.Rakesh Roshan's younger brother - Rajesh Roshan has composed unforgettable gems for this movie. Other than the immortal - Thoda Hai, Thode Ki Zaroorat Hai, the music of the movie contain another gem - Yeh Jeena Hai Angoor Ka Daana (the title track in the voices of Kishore Kumar and Usha Mangeshkar). There are hilarious songs viz. Mummy O Mummy, Tu Kab Saas Banegi, Roll Roll and Frenny O Frenny in the movie. However it contains a song which has made a permanent place in my heart. It is Kishore-Lata duet - Tumse Mila Tha Pyar Kuchh Achchhe Naseeb Se, Hum Unn Dino Ameer The Jab Tum Kareeb The.Technically, the movie is perfect because it portrays the milieu that it purports to portray. Art director and cinematographer have done an outstanding job in creating a middle class environment on the screen. Editor has also done his pretty well and there is not even an ounce of boredom in the movie.My final words, the great message delivered by this highly entertaining and inspiring classic is - do believe in the strength of love, keep the love within the family intact and strengthen it. Love is the panacea for all the ills, the master-key for all the locks and the solution to all the problems of life. In this era of nuclear families, Khatta Meetha shows how the members of an extended family can adjust with one another, even out mutual differences and join hands to stand up to any external threat which is common to the family as a whole. The analogy of family can be used for the whole nation too. In a country like India where a general license seems to have been issued to hate others, this movie teaches to love and believe in the power of love. 
tt0077797;  Ashok Kumar is the father of four sons, and Pearl Padamsee is a mother of two sons, and a rather overweight and emotional daughter. When David proposes that they marry each other - which they do - chaos results.Add to this we have Deven Verma, who is simply anxious, to the point of an obsession, to get married to any girl, and he not only keeps on pestering his poor mom, Piloo Wadia, but his co-workers, his acquaintances, and al. Kishore Kumar's "Mommy O Mommy tu kab saas banegi, Mommy O mommy tu kab saas banegi..." (O Mother mine when will you become a mother-in-law...)is simply hilarious, and must be seen to be believed. A must-see movie for the entire family.  
tt0077797; Rohit Shetty in GOLMAAL 3(2010) borrowed a lot from this film though both are like comparing Rohit Shetty to Basu Chatergee. The film is inspired from Yours Mine and Ours The film has talents like Ashok Kumar,Rakesh Roshan all together. The film is a well made comedy and makes Golmaal 3 look like a crass piece of nonsense which anywayz it is. This film has comedy scenes but hardly slapstick more situational. The comedy is hardly over the top and makes you laugh.Direction is good Music is superb, Thoda Hai Thode Ki being the best song sung by Kishore Kumar, rest songs are goodAshok Kumar is excellent as always, Pearl Padamsee makes a superb debut, Rakesh Roshan is lovable as always, Bindiya Goswami is fab Preeti Ganguly is superb, Deven Verma is as always hilarious Ranjit Chaudary makes a superb debut, others are all good 
tt0116153; Ever heard of this film? Many times filmmakers cheat audiences, Like for instance having 2 big stars in small roles yet promote as their film, It happened many times in past and present Dushman Duniya Ka has Salman and Srk in guest roles but the film was promoted as their film. The main story is regarding drugs, which was based on Lucky Ali's earlier life as a drug addict. The film marks debut of Mehmood's son Manzoor Ali who never acted again, The story is good but treatment is horrible. The film hardly evokes reactions and the much publicised Salman and Srk's roles are unwanted. Salman does a spoof on Kishore Kumar from Padosan(1968) while Srk dresses up as Mehmood.Direction by Mehmood could be better Music is okay,This film marks Himesh Reshammiya's unknown debut as music directorSalman and Srk have few odd minutes are both are wasted, Manzoor Ali fails in his role, Jeetendra is as usual,The film also has Ali Asgar and other TV actors 
tt0116153; Wow, what a masala (mix of spices)! This epic, if we can call it so, as it covers the full (short) lifetime of its protagonist "Lucky", from when his parents first met, to when he is finally buried... this movie has its good share of sometimes very silly comedy (the pop-eye headmaster, professor Liliput, even Shahrukh Khan comes over quite strangely, but sympathetic), romance at times very well done - but most of all it's a grabbing, poignant description of drug addiction and what tragical things it can do to people, demonstrated on the eradication of a once happy family. The earnestness of the message is driven home by the first closing title which reads: "Hopefully THE END to drugs" - of course, it wasn't.This was the last movie the popular comedian Mehmood directed, and reading Wikipedia on Lucky Ali, it appears that he had a very personal message to tell - to the cinema audience, but mostly to his son Lucky who was experimenting with Marihuana. Lucky refused to play the "Lucky" role, which his brother Manzoor Ali played instead, but started playback singing with "Nasha Nasha" in this film - a bizarre song & dance number of drug addicts.Mehmood himself plays goat-Baba, the scurrilous drug dealer - clad in green, with goat horns and a goat voice, he pushes his ware to young people, while repeatedly warning them... a bizarre person.If you want to see strong drama which can make your tears flow, I can strongly recommend this. But it also had the biggest laugh I ever got from a Bollywood movie - Lata acting as a hen... :^)The German title of the DVD is "Ein kleines LA¤cheln" (a little smile) - the grossest understatement! "Feind der Welt" (enemy of the world) would have been a correct translation of "Dushman Duniya ka". 
tt0337678; I was waiting for this movie for a long time. After all, it's the first Russian movie with Rutger Hauer, my favourite actor. According the first news about "Mirror Wars: Reflection One" - it will be screen version of "Labyrinth of Reflections" - the novel by Sergey Lukyanenko, the author of the "NightWatch" trilogy. However, fortunately, those rumors was fake ("Labyrinth of Reflections" or "Glubina" will be filming in the next year, double fortunately, without Rutger) - "Mirror Wars: Reflection One" - spy action movie about Russian air forces and new interceptor "Sabretooth". Some terrorist organization which wants to get hold it, so Mysterious Man (Hauer) gave order to Dick Murdock (McDowell) - ex-CIA agent, who became a first class terrorist after being captured in China - to provoke conflict between USA and Russia with "Sabretooth". However, Alexei Kedrov (Efimov) - the brave pilot of "Sabretooth" don't want to give the interceptor to the bad guys. The whole film isn't bad (there is some good action scenes on the earth and in the air), but sometime it's a slightly inconsistently and boring. Seems, all movie budget was spent for action scenes, plane crashings (very effective - without CG!) and three foreign actors. As about Russian actors - for many of them "Mirror Wars: Reflection One" was their first movie. Their performance is rather boring and unnatural - in contrast to their foreign colleagues. McDowell is great villain, Assante - in good traditions of his old movies, Hauer - mysterious charismatic old man. So... 5 out of 10, I think. 
tt0337678; I wasn't expecting much out of the film, but they do tout lots of impressive live action air scenes, which sounded appealing to me. And in truth, there are some. But most are simply stuff you'd find in an air show, I was expecting more in the way of dogfights. There is a dogfight eventually, but it consists of 2 CGI F-15s shooting 3 CGI missiles at the plane, and the plane "dodging" them. Basically, the highlight is a live action air scenes is maneuver called a "Cobra", where the plane sort of rears back on its tail in a controlled manner. Which is neat, but not the sort of thing that wows people who don't understand what the maneuver is (though I guess is probably very popular in Russia, since I believe they invented it). The most impressive action scene is not in the air, but a battle on an air base, between Russian special forces (I think) and terrorists.Anyway, the plot of this is a little hard to follow. There's a super secret new Russian plane (actually just a SU-30, a nice enough plane, but nothing special). And terrorists are trying to do something to the pilots. Then we find out that it's Malcom McDowell who is the terrorist, and ex-CIA agent, with Armad Assante being a current CIA agent trying to stop him (or something). Rutger Hauer is technically in this, but he's in two scenes. And just what he is, I wasn't sure.The trouble is, it's long. A lot of the story focuses on the "good" pilot, who isn't a jerk like the others. We see him fall in love with an American animal rights person (?) who looks 100% Russian (pretty, but doesn't even remotely look American), then he has some angst with his father (who is the designer of the plane, I think), and the antics of the other pilots. That stuff should have been trimmed out. And much of the spy stuff is boring. You have Malcom McDowell vs Armand Assante's team of CIA (I think) along with a Russian duo (who are likable, but not overly competent). They play a cat and mouse game, but it's hard to know what exactly is going on.It does suffer from a bad English dubbing, but there are worse. Much much worse. It's passable. The real problem is all the dull scenes. Cut it out and it would have been a good movie. As is, it's worth a watch, but not great. 
tt0337678; i watched this because i wanted to see the SU-30.Its a very rare opportunity to see any real Russian fighter because in most well known aviator movies of the 80's like Top Gun and Iron Eagle,American producers couldn't get their hands on Russian aircraft using ridiculous substitutes ,usually as MIGS,planes like F-5's and even Phantoms. So if you want to see a real Russian plane its in this movie. The gimmick about it being a super special plane was not needed at all,they could have had the same story with terrorists wanting to hijack the real plane without having to make up a story about an imaginary plane. However i think the aerial scenes leave a lot to be desired.If only these Russian guys who made this movie could at least get that right. The rest of the movie suffers from the obvious fact the producers wanted to sell it to the American market.I mean if there is something more ridiculous than Russian pilots and generals speaking badly dubbed English,and American English at that,i don't know what that is.That was the most annoying thing for me.Actually some of the Russian actors didn't do a bad job but the dubbing made their performance sound like some guy reading a newspaper in his toilet. Also i didn't see the point of not hiring a couple of cheap European and American actors to play the respective parts.I mean,the lead female is obviously a Russian actress playing an American.I'm sure they could have hired a non-name American actress who would do a more believable job. All these things i think could have been avoided and with the same budget. Out of the 3 names Assante does an OK job,McDowell is good as the villain,Hauer appears very briefly. 
tt0337678; Why did I watch this? That's easy: Rutger Hauer is in it. But I can safely say don't watch this rubbish for him, as Mr. Hauer has approximately 2 minutes of screen time, divided over two brief scenes. Of course it's not his fault that DVD distributors put his name in big letters on the cover, right next to Malcolm McDowell and Armand Assante. The rest of the cast is compiled out of a bunch of unknown Russian actors - at least in my country they are unknown - with dubbed voices and zero acting talent.The plot tries to be some sort of international, political-flavored spy intrigue with weapon smugglers, environmental activists, some hotshot jet pilots and it all involves a top secret, hi-tech, newly developed stealth fighter jet (which looks just like any other jet plane, really). Along the way the plot also incorporates an attempted assault on Air Force One (including the president on board) in mid-air.About 25 minutes into the movie I was still thinking "What the hell is going on here?". It doesn't really matter what this film is about. It doesn't matter the plot can't really focus on anything decently. It doesn't really matter this film is filled with cardboard characters. It's all a heap of nonsense. Boring nonsense at that too. And badly made. Abslolute low-point was an obligatory "let's fall in love" sequence with one of the pilots - who on top of that has underdeveloped issues with his father, inventor of the stealth jet - and a female environmental activist that turns out to be a spy too. Man, that sequence was so toe-curlingly bad you won't believe it. A walk in the woods, lots of laughing & fooling around. A boat-ride. Some kissing. And then back to the tent to have sex. All this on the tunes of dreadful music. I was under the impression the 80's were over. Apparently not in Russia. All the music in this film pretty much stinks to high heavens, for that matter. And this film features a lot of music.Things blow up. People get shot. The jet gets saved and the bad guys get away. Or something. Like I cared. Complete rubbish. I still can't believe I watched the whole thing. 
tt0337678; One of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Simply a low-budget movie with too much talking and less action. Most actors act poor, not convincing and with fake emotions. The movie is all about a 'high-tech stealth fighter' so I expected to see one. But no, they simply used a conventional Russian plane and didn't make a single change for the movie. In the movie itself they justify it by saying something like 'it's not the shape what matters, but the materials it's made off'. I'm sure they have a good reason to use as much as Russian actors cos after all, the story takes place in Russia. But I'm sorry to say, they're acting is bad, fake and not convincing. 
tt0337678; I do not usually take the time to write reviews, but I had to say something about this movie. This was a B movie trying to be more - which it could have been. I watched it because it had two of my faves - Malcolm McDowell and Rutger Hauer. I ask them why such good actors, especially Malcolm, would degrade themselves by being in this movie. The story is just so-so. It could have been a good story but it had some major inconsistencies and illogics that made the story look stupid (in some parts). The photography was decent. And the action wasn't too bad. What made it a B movie was the despicable dub-in. Did they hire bums off the street to do this? Most of the voices sounded like robots. No life. The one doing the the voice for the American girl was very obviously Russian. If they hired two well known American actors for the movie, why couldn't they hire an American to dub in for an American character? Very unprofessional. These Russian film makers need to go back to film school. And probably marketing school too. If they invested money to hire American actors to sell their movie - which they obviously did - they wasted their money because the above unprofessionalism negated what they did right. The fact that I voted as high as 5 shows how much they blew it, because with just a bit more effort and professionalism they could have had a much better product. 
tt0337678; whole movies seems irrelevant and copy of American movies(mix 8-10 movies). There they have made a film with really bad cinematography & bad English dubbing .But what made me watch this movie till end. . .. its the Supreme Air superiority plane ever made on earth: THE SUKHOI 30. With fantastic coverage of each maneuver & Best showing its strength.though i didn't recognize any of actors in movie but acting is of poorest level even worse than Adam Sander.the power of Su-30 is proved in Red Flag winning 90% fights without activating new radars against E3c-Sentry & f-15 combos. WATCH IT IF YOU LOVE SUKHOI. 
tt0337678; OK, this isn't the best movie I've ever seen regarding military aviation but it is worth watching once. There are some nice flying sections and a battle that is reasonable to watch. There is a plot and some sub plots going on which are somewhat entertaining. If you sat through Fire Birds, just shut off the same part of your brain and you'll enjoy this, at least you don't have to deal with the Jones/Cage macho personality battle. To me, the Sukhoi flying footage alone is worth watching a few times. Given the price you can get the DVD for, it is worth adding to a collection of military aircraft films. How much you like it will depend on what you are looking for in a film. 
tt0337678; this movie isn't my cup of tea.i couldn't watch it all,since i lost interest,but form what i saw,it just wasn't good.i just found it boring,with pretty bad acting,and a plot that is all over the place.it's a Russian made movie,the second i have seen now.the first one being Nightwatch.i didn't like that movie either.it also has a plot that doesn't make a lot of sense,at least in my opinion.anyway,Mirror Wars starts off promising enough,with some scenes of jet fighters doing maneuvers,which look pretty impressive.after that though,it's not so good.i wouldn't recommend it myself,but if you liked Nghtwatch,you might like this movie.for me,Mirror Wars is a 3/10 
tt0166503;  Beshkempir is one of the resonable rare films which does not  overfill you with a lot of pictures. The story is very simple  - the growing up of a young boy in a rural part in Kirgistan - but it contains in a way the whole "meaning of life". The growing up from child to a young adult is shown in a tremendous poetic way  
tt0166503; A minimalist film from Kyrgyzstan, a Central Asian nation and former Soviet republic (there are several alternative spellings of the country). Shot in black and white, but with a few scenes in color, the film is set on a rural village and starts as a young baby boy is adopted by another family. The film cuts to several years later, when the boy is now a teenager. With other boys he is shown having the small adventures that boys in small towns have, stealing fruits from a neighbor, fighting, splashing in a mud pool, going with the rest of the village to an outdoor cinema (where an Indian film is shown, using an old projector). The central conflict of the movie starts when other boy, after losing against him the favor of one of the girls, tells him he is an adopted boy (which is apparently a cause for embarrassment in the local culture). This small conflict will eventually reach a happy resolution, when his parents (which had hide to him his origins) tell him the truth. The movie is well done, in the tradition of the slow Soviet art movies, though it would be a stretch to call it a masterpiece. But because the country and its culture are little known outside the former Soviet Union, most of the viewers will see the film with the thrill of discovery, as a portrayal of a strange, little known culture. 
tt0166503;  Not only is this film visually beautiful, shot in black and white with occasional scenes in color depicting the rural village where the film is set and its ancient rituals and traditions, but Abdykalykov also succeeds in telling us the story of Beshkempir, a boy who discovers his adoption, and the transition he makes from a child to a young adult.  Strongly recommended.  
tt0166503; Sometimes striking cinematography that vacillates between chromatic and monochromatic lends verisimilitude to this tale of a young boy in search of his roots. Like the boy in CINEMA PARADISO, BESHKEMPIR finds himself drawn to the after dark outdoor screening(s) of movies in his village. Here, as in the opening sequence showing the boy's own birth, Life is rendered in glorious Color. It's a far cry from the drab day-to-day realities of life in the village (where everything is literally earth-bound, villagers are shown making bricks from mud and sod and laying them out in the sun to dry and harden). BESHKEMPIR soon becomes a quiet, sometimes subtle meditation on the cruelty and comradeship of kids. He learns, along the way, that when Mother Nature calls, nobody hangs up... 
tt0166503;  This movie has a great peace. It shows that materialism is something we hang onto too much. The atmosphere of the movie is breathtaking. There's not that much happening in the movie but that doesn't make it less interesting. The black and white and colored sequences are beautifully interacting.8 out of 10. 
tt0166503;  This film is not only well-acted and written, but it also one of the most visually impressive in years.  The story is very simplistic in nature, and its detailed scenes of childhood discovery are captivating and enlightening. A great movie for movie goers of all ages and interests. 
tt0166503; When I was first watching this movie, I was reminded of Fellini's "Armacord," because it seemed to be more poetic and atmospheric in nature than driven by a narrative structure. I soon realized that it was not so much the collage sort of film that Fellini had made of his reminiscence of his childhood, but that there was a narrative to "Beshkempir." This film is wonderfully acted, filmed, and edited, and it incorporates the sounds of nature to great effect. As other reviewers have written, the film's pace is "slow," but deliberately so. It gives the viewer time to soak in the landscape, feel familiar with the village and its surroundings, and get to "know" the characters as well as the traditions of the village. It is a peak into the world of Kygystan, which was my first ever, and I envied the closeness of the villagers and the rich life they live with only the most essential of material things.This is a coming of age film, but one done in a way that has made it one of my favorite movies of all time. Not enough people in the world will ever know of it, even though it ranks among the best of works by filmmakers like Truffeat, Bergman, and Rohmer, all favorite directors of mine for years. 
tt0166503; This movie is interesting primarily because it is a Kyrgyzstani film, and as such it offers a few interesting glimpses of Kyrgyz culture and rituals - particularly those around death after the passing of Beshkempir's mother. Aside from that, I didn't find a whole lot to get excited about in this pretty straightforward coming of age story. Beshkempir is the title character - a boy adopted as a baby by a childless couple, but who has never been told he's adopted. He's treated with a strange mix of contempt and acceptance by the other boys of his village (who know the secret) and even by his own father, although by the end of the movie Beshkempir and his father seem to have sorted out their relationship. Eventually, in a competition for the attentions of a local girl, Beshkempir's secret comes out, and the entire village has to come to terms with it. The movie is filmed mostly in black and white with occasional bursts of colour popping in. It didn't really take hold of me. Overall, a disappointment. 3/10 
tt1517238; She has her 50th anniversary and does all the work, including serving her guests, which are ignoring her. But she gets one useful present. This puzzle.An this Argentinian housewife suddenly is blessed with talent, something nobody including her family family had ever thought of. This is about her slowly breaking out, meeting a puzzle partner who trains her until they can enter a competition together. There was a way out.A fine little movie with low voice, never arguing. Heroism can also be about sitting at a table. It mostly is, in this thing we call life. The heroism which really changes it. 
tt1517238; It might be a movie about passion (of puzzle), but of course it is much more, though not a riddle to see through the hints the director is giving us. The puzzle stands for so much more and while it is difficult to think of how a movie would work with a theme about this, it indeed works quite well as I had the chance to witness at the Internation Festival in Berlin this February.As you can see this is a non-English movie and lately I saw a trailer for a movie with Kevin Kline, if I'm not mistaken, where the movie itself seemed to be a remake of this one. They just changed the "game" (no pun intended) and chess out of it. Couldn't find it under the movie connection on IMDb ... though I guess it can't be too long before someone notices. It just seems to similar. But however good that movie is, it took the easy way, with chess. A game that is so much more popular and so much more interesting to watch others do. With puzzle(s) you have the risk to annoy and bore people. Which might easily have happened to some here too. But it's not about the game ... it's about the players (or characters if you will). 
tt1517238; As the story begins, we are invited to a birthday party. Maria del Carmen, the lady of the house is seen putting the final touches to everything. Little does one know it is a party to honor her. She is surrounded by a her own family, and friends. Bringing a plate to the table, she misses putting it on the table, breaking it. Picking up the pieces, Maria discovers she has an ability for reassembling the plate, bringing it to its original shape.Maria is a fifty something housewife in a suburb of Buenos Aires. Her husband, Juan, and two grown sons, complete the household. Juan shows all the traces of being a macho man, finding fault with the fruits Maria serves him for dessert. The boys, who must be in the early twenties are planning to leave home. Juan and Maria still enjoy a healthy sex life, something that in other couples of the same age might have died completely.One of Maria's birthday presents is a jigsaw puzzle. She is intrigued by the Egyptian female figure adorning the cover of the box. Maria has no trouble solving the picture. Her interest is piqued when she discovers an ad for someone to participate in training for the game, leading for a national tournament. That puts her in touch with Roberto, an elegant man of means who realizes the potential in Maria as a puzzle solver. In order to meet her new friend, she lies to Juan about a sick aunt recuperating from an operation.Roberto and Maria begin solving together. He has hundreds of those boxes in a room of his house. Maria is skeptic, at first, but she finds a soothing atmosphere by putting all the pieces together. Juan, who is not aware of what is happening, notices the change in his wife, beginning to resent Maria for her new pastime. At the same time, Roberto insists they become a team for the international competition which will be held in Germany, something that Maria will never be able to do. At the same time, Roberto has fallen under the spell of Maria's gentleness, something he is lacking in his own life.This film was a rare treat when it showed recently on a cable channel. First time director Natalia Smirnoff, closely associated to some of her country's leading film creators as a casting director, surprises with a film that shows a talent that must be recognized. Ms. Smirnoff wrote the screenplay for the film. It is obvious she knows these people. Her story is a sobering account of a middle age woman who is somewhat taken for granted by a husband with whom she has shared many years of marriage. Now, at a time when she and her man are facing an upcoming retirement, she finds fulfillment in a game for which she has a natural talent. Maria shows signs of boredom with the way her life has turned out. Discovering a game she knows nothing about, is a way for her to get involved in things that are not household related. Meeting Roberto gives her an opportunity to continue getting better at a game where she excels. Roberto, a lonely man, sees in Maria a kind soul, but he shows restrain in the way he shows how he feels toward her. Maria finds herself in a position where she is not able to decide what is best for her, although ultimately, her own common sense brings her back to reality.One could not think of another actress but Maria Onetto playing Maria. Ms. Onetto underplays her character, giving a performance that will long be remembered. Gabriel Goity is Juan, the husband who is still in love with Maria in spite of his own views about the place of a woman. The excellent Arturo Goetz is on hand to give life to Roberto, the professional player who takes an interest in Maria. Barbara Alvarez, the cinematographer captures both Maria's home, in sharp contrast with Roberto's more opulent residence. The music score is by Alejandro Franov. We congratulate Ms. Smirnoff for a magnificent first film, hoping her talent will be recognized and we expect new ventures from her. 
tt0070552;  if you have never seen an Italian crime movie, this is a great place to start. unlike many other films of this type, it actually works on an emotional level as well as being very entertaining, simular to the films of Scorsese. it's a very violent film, but none of the violence is gratuitous. lots of stylish slow motion shootings, car explosions, and people run over by various moter vehicles, and the excellent musical score by Guido and Maurizio De Angelis captures the emotion of these scenes perfectly. the cast is also very good, especialy Italian Star Franco Nero. highly recommended. 
tt0070552; Fast paced, violent and innovative crime thriller with director Castellari and star, Franco Nero on top form. This becomes a little complicated in the middle when there is some jockeying for position between baddies but it finishes well and that start! The great cinematography is evident from the beginning of the credits when from behind the titles we see the gradually enlarging exit to a shipping tunnel. As soon as we dock the chase is on as the suspected drug dealer is chased around the streets by good cop Nero. And what a chase, now I'm no great fan of such things that can in my opinion be overused as padding, but here is a real thrill, and so it goes on for much of the film. Not much time for romance and just the briefest nudity before we are back on the hectic and all consuming search for Mr Big. Lots of references to corruption, communism and general unrest all add to the atmosphere. Have only had the chance to see this dubbed so a subtitled print would be good to see some time. 
tt0070552;  This was the first break-through success of a Poliziotti Italian crime movie and spawned several dozen imitations.  Possibly the best film ever made, High Crime delivers the goods like few other movies, blending some experimental filming and editing techniques in with some good performances, solid action sequences, great music, and some pretty stunning photography by Alejandro Ulloa.  Unlike a lot of other crime flicks made around the same period, this film isn't sympathetic at all to the villains.  They are cold and heartless thugs who's so anything to keep themselves out of jail where they rightfully belong.  This film is completely fascist and right-wing in its undertones, yet maintains an engaging level of emotional impact throughout.  The scene where Franco Nero discovers his daughter dead made me almost want to cry... and Castellari expertly handles the flashbacks and knows just when to use slow motion in all the right spots.This wasn't the film which set the trend in Italian crime films (see Violent Professionals) but it was an excellent film which caused their widespread (yet short-lived) popularity.  Certain elements (like the getting-in-car-gun-down) were endlessly repeated in the genre by Castellari himself as well as his father Marino Girolami, who totally ripped off the ending of this film in ROMA VIOLENTA, a much more typical film in the genre with Maurizio Merli, who although is not as good an actor as Franco Nero, is much more intense as the leading man in these sorts of films. 
tt0070552; Wow! This film has all that you've come to expect from a Euro Crime flick. Violent murders, long shoot-outs with machine guns, a hot-tempered police officer who loathes criminals, downright evil henchmen and much, much more. Franco Nero has lately become one of my favorite actors, and not without a reason, in this film he proves what a talent he really had. This might just be Enzo G. Castellari's best crime film. It's very nicely directed, with some very interesting camera work and the music by the De Angelis brothers is the best and most suitable score I've heard them deliver to this point. It perfectly fits in with the various situations that Nero's character finds himself in.The only copy I could get a hold of was a region 0 release from 23rd Century (?). It does not have the best audio or video quality, but it's watchable. Availiable on Ebay as "The Marseilles Connection".If you're a fan of either Nero or Castellari, or of course, both, this is a film you have to see! 
tt0070552; In case you're looking for action cinema without restraints, boundaries, fake sentiment or political correctness, you have to aim your senses towards the so-called Italian "Poliziottesco" movies. That is a commonly known fact, or at least I always assumed so, but still this is a vastly underrated sub genre even among cult cinema fanatics. The same great names of Italian cult cinema often return, like for example those of director Enzo G. Castellari and charismatic lead actor Franco Nero. These two prodigies often worked together, but this is arguably their finest piece of work (or at least on par with the terrific western "Keoma"). The words "awesome" and "brilliant" spring to mind when witnessing a movie that opens with artsy credits and promptly continues with an exhilarating and non-stop 10 minutes (!) lasting car chase sequence and then a virulent explosion. The intro immediately sets the pace for a masterfully adrenalin-rushing and hardcore-to-the-bone cop thriller, reminiscent to "The French Connection" and "Dirty Harry" only much more outrageous. Franco Nero depicts the devoted and unstoppable police commissioner Belli, who initiates a merciless crusade to cleanse his city entirely of Mafiosi, drug couriers and corruption. Belli receives voluntary cooperation from a former crime boss, but he's undoubtedly doing it for his own benefit. The support from his superiors is minimal since several prominent citizens may be involved in dirty business and, whenever Belli reaches a major breakthrough in his investigations, they try and strike back on a personal level. The overall plot, with particularly the double-crossings and betrayals between crime gang members mutually, is extremely convoluted and often very confusing but the extended and mega-violent shootout sequences don't require a lot of thinking. The villains are truly relentless and loathsome thugs without a conscience whatsoever, but Belli isn't a wussy himself, as his investigation methods qualify as quite unorthodox as well. Without wanting to ruin things, I can safely say there are a couple of very effective sentimental and dramatic moments near the end of the film Â<U+0096> as well as some blatant shocks Â<U+0096> and "High Crime" ends exactly like it begun: with a long and fascinating explosion of violence and excitement. The score is terrific and Castellari once again proves that he's a visually very gifted director, as the stylistic trademarks are often stunning to behold. 
tt0070552; This was my introduction to Poliziotteschi films, and also my introduction to Enzo G Castellari, who in my opinion may be the greatest Italian director of the 70s and 80s. I can't get enough of this guy's films! In fact, when I started watching this, a large beam of light focused on me and a voice said "Spend cash on all my movies, chosen one." This was a rubbish video transfer copy of High Crime that I picked up for a quid, but even the washed out look and occasional flicker couldn't detract from the greatness of this movie. It's proof that beyond zombie flicks and slasher movies, there's a whole world of groovy Italian films out there. A mysterious man is taken from Marsielles to Genoa, and before he can go about his business, he's on the run from the cops, led by Comissioner Belli (Nero). The chase soon switches from foot to car, with some really dangerous looking stunts going on. There's one shot where the cars are heading straight for the cameraman, then abruptly cuts away. Hope the guy survived. If not, then he died contributing towards a good cause. Who knows in these films.Belli gets his man, but before he can question him a car bomb kills the guy, three cops, and a little girl. As this is an Italian movie, we get to see a burning carcass flying out of the car window when it blows up. The film has hardly started. It seems that there's a new crime family trying to muscle in on things in Genoa, and Belli wants to get straight to the top and arrest Mister Big. Belli's boss, played by James Whitmore, knows who these guys are but due to their political connections is reluctant to do anything about it. Belli ends up getting help from an unlikely source: an ailing mafia boss who's own men are starting to switch sides, a man who also seems to be obsessed with using metaphors and analogies littered with animal/insect/eating imagery. He's cool though, and his sidekick was alright too. The problems facing Belli and numerous: who is the real Mister Big? Who can he trust? Every time he thinks he's got to the top, the suspect is murdered. Worse still, the deeper he gets the more his loved ones are put at risk. Does he risk all or heed the repeated warnings to back off? This being an Italian film, do you think anyone at all will be alive at the end of the film?There's hardly a minute wasted in High Crime. A constantly shifting storyline that flys through its running time, switching scenes at an alarming rate, and only slightly getting confusing once all the characters are introduced. By that point, however, people start getting bumped off as characters double cross each other and try to shift suspicion onto others. This is done usually in slow motion, with a kind of standard squib-or-no-squib-at-all technique that is also prevalent in Italian war movies. Aside from the funky soundtrack, there are two main factors that make this film a classic: Castellari and Nero. The direction is flawlessly high energy: even dialogue scenes are infused with nervous hyperactivity. There's good use of slow motion, especially when main characters are assassinated, plus plenty of bizarre camera angles, shaky cam, and some shots that reminded me of spaghetti westerns. Everyone is kind of sleazy, and you can't help applaud when a guy with a slight squint sniffs some smack, turns to the camera and mutters 'pure snow'. He doesn't shy away from the violence either. One character is killed by meathooks, another has his head run over by a bike, then gets castrated, a kid gets run over and dragged along the road, and in one stand-out scene, Massimo Vanni gets shot in the balls in slow motion! When Massimo Vanni turns up in a film he always does two things - a couple of stunts, and a mini massacre, then a (sometimes) gory death. He's class. Watch for him in Street Law, Bronx Warriors, Big Racket, Bronx Warriors 2, Zombie Flesh Eaters 2 (and 3!) and other films I've forgotten. I befriended a stray dog when staying in Sorrento last year, and someone had gone out their way to buy this dog a tag naming him Massimo. I knew there and then it was a tribute to Massimo Vanni. Franco Nero is the icing on the cake. The guy acts his socks off here. Belli does three things: chasing people, shouting and slapping people around. When he's not doing one he's doing another. He shouts at the bad guys, his colleagues, even his girlfriend. He slaps six different people around. The guy literally cannot sit still. His agitation at the ever elusive Mister Big comes out in flailing hands and stamping feet, gnashing of teeth and bursting into rooms. When the film calls for him to be more calm and emotional, he can do that too. Then he slaps more people around and kills them. This is a brilliant film, and it feels somehow epic even though it lasts just over 90 minutes. If they remade it today in Hollywood it would last 4 hours and be Shiite. 
tt0070552;  One of Castellari's finest works.  The acting is superb.  Excellent usage of lighting and settings.  Unpredictable turn of events and good images. There is almost nothing wrong with this film for people who are into crime dramas. 
tt0070552; "High Crime" aka "The Marseilles Connection" by Enzo G.Castellari with Franco Nero actually helped popularize the Italian cop thriller genre/poliziotteschi.The film is extremely well-acted and features plenty of brutal and bloody violence.Franco Nero plays police commissioner Belli who wants to destroy dangerous European drug ring.When gangsters kill his daughter Nero becomes an angry killing machine.I must say that I found "High Crime" utterly fascinating.It's a vicious and mean-spirited cop thriller with unforgettable moment where little girl is run over with a car.It's obvious that Franco Nero's character was an influence for Maurizio Merli's Inspector Tanzi in later poliziotteschi movies.It's a crying shame that "High Crime" is still unavailable on DVD.9 car chases out of 10. 
tt0070552; Enzo G. Castellari's first police procedural crime thriller "High Crime" a.k.a. "La polizia incrimina la legge assolve" (1973) qualifies as violent, tragic, but memorable. The auto chases are fast and furious. The villains are thoroughgoing dastards who are prepared to kill anybody, including children. They run down our hero's daughter without a qualm in one scene. Not only do they smash into her, but they also drive over her body. Of course, obvious dummies were used in this scene as well as in the explosion scenes, but the violence is emphatic. This is like dummies pitched off a building that hit the street several floors below. A policeman on foot fires into a car barreling toward him and the criminals smash into his body. Again, the filmmakers use a dummy, but everything is done with a visceral sense of urgency that makes it exciting if not horrific. Castellari and company stage some beautiful fireball explosions that hold your attention. Spaghetti western star Franco Nero plays the energetic but frustrated Italian Vice-Commissioner Belli who will never be the same after this war with the mob. "High Crime" comes with a double-digit body count, and the significant shootings are presented in slow-motion. A high-ranking police official takes three bullets in his body when his back is turned to a heavy. You'll hate the bad guys and savor their deaths by fade-out. Although this 100-minute melodrama features a happy ending, the toll that Belli's crusade against crime takes leaves a bitter after-taste. One anonymous commentator at a download site has written that "High Crime" "was largely responsible for setting off the entire Italian crime film movement of the 70's.""High Crime" opens with our heroic police officer arresting an elusive Lebanese drug dealer in Genoa after a careening auto chase through the city. Unfortunately, Belli doesn't keep the Lebanese in custody long before the wily criminals blow up the police car transporting his prisoner. Miraculously, Belli wasn't seated in the vehicle when it blew up and killed the Lebanese and four cops, along with a young girl playing nearby in the street. Meantime, Belli's superior, Commissioner Aldo Scavino (JamesWhitmore), wants to get adequate evidence on everybody from the bottom to the top and he is prepared to exercise patience in his battle with organized crime. Assiduously, he has compiled a dossier on mafia connections, but Belli lacks Scaviono's patience. Belli is a man of action. He consults with a former crime boss, Cafiero (Fernando Rey of "The French Connection"), who spends most of his time in his rose garden. Cafiero warns our hot-headed hero that if the mob cannot put him on ice, they will go after the people that he loves. Meanwhile, the mob ambushes Scavino as he is getting into his car in an exciting shoot-out sequence that continues when a street cop opens fire on the two killers as they flee from the scene of the crime. "High Crime" is unforgettable. 
tt0070552; Like an Italian version of the Sweeney (Nineteen Seventies British police show), cigarettes are there to be smoked, girlfriends are there to be slapped, trench coats are there to billow behind you like a cape as you chase your villains down the street. There are two especially memorable scenes, which make this film. A short but almost Italian Job-esquire car chase through the streets of Genoa, filmed from axle height so it looks faster, complete with an Alfa-Romeo Giulia Police car cornering so sharply that the tyres almost tare themselves off the rims. Needless to say it ends messily, with some gruesome violence that no Hollywood director would dare to film because it shows the fragility of human life (Remember always check under your car for devices...). A sophisticated dinner party, where a roving camera crew is used as a simple but effective way of introducing some of the prime suspects, complete with off the cuff comments about what these prominent citizens have to hide. Aside from this the plot is wonderfully Byzantine, leaving you wondering 'So who was it?' and an ending which leaves you thinking that nothing is going to change- which is probably what strife and Mafia torn 1970's Italy felt like.

tt0260193;  Film maker Philippe Falardeau mixes mockumentary about unemployment with a political statement about the destructive corporate greed of capitalistic politics.  He filmed this in 1999, but it does not represent a specific year.  The audience enjoyed this tale of foibles encountered in his roommates quest to end unemployment with the 'right' job.  The absurd pickiness of Engineering job ads was good for laughs, but it's truth was rather revolting.  This story was inspired by the director's real former roommate, and was his statement of complaint of about how "when you loose your job, you loose your social identity," and the systemic destruction that goes with that loss in modern globalized society.  This French language film was made in Quebec and will be released in France... with French subtitles. The acting is very natural, and the locations fit the story well.  This is well filmed, a good story, and worth seeing.Falardeau said that the story was obviously made up by the end because nobody's life could be that bad.  Of course until then, he hadn't met me.  
tt0260193;  The misconception and the high expectations that University students have about the ideal job can be deceiving, facing the reality of the availability (or lack of) of works without compromising their principles is harsh. The concept "documentary" that Philippe Falardeau choose is the perfect example of QuA©bec way to resolve the problem of lack of money to do a movie. And it works perfectly. Some of the dialogues in this movie are simply sharp and clever. Falardeau found a great way to expose the contingencies of the real world that we live in by following a young man freshly out of school ready to conquer the world.  
tt0260193;  Philippe Falardeau's film is clever, touching, funny, has amazing documentary qualities.Actor's performances are so good, that one forgets that they are not "real" people in a "real" crisis. I'm looking forward to see the next Philippe  Falardeau's film 
tt0260193; ...but the acting should've been more real. It feels very fake.Some scenes were really funny and flowed well with the rest of the film. And it might be worth watching for its attempt at a mock doc. But again, if the acting was more natural, this film would've worked. 
tt0260193;  Wonderfully acted.The first time I watched this film I thought it was a real documentary and I got totally sucked in. This is definitely a film worth watching at least twice. 
tt0364656; What's with the ratings system on IMDb? You look at the vote tally & it's 6.6 median & 7+ average but they mark it 5.4 on the movie site. What = only a few key players votes count?? Anyway this movie blows anything done by Hollywood (or "indie") hacks in about 30 or 40 years. Outsmarts Mamet at his guessing games. Outpaces Soderbergh at his capering best. Outstyles the Coens by a couple galaxies. And hey, the sets don't have that cookie cutter Metropolitan Home look the Hollywood & indie flicks all subscribe to.The plot is wonderful, the acting by everyone is phenomenal. This movie will keep you guessing (& catching you breath) right up to & including the last frame.Simply terrific! 10 for 10 
tt0364656;  Film noir Canadian style shot on a shoestring budget.  Kevin Pollak in a rare lead role.  Some interesting twists and turns.  Lies and deception. Happy ending.    It is refreshing to have the film set at Christmas, and creates opportunities for delightful contrasts with low-lifes and Christmas music.I love the genre and I liked the movie.  Not great by any means.  But it moved along nicely and had enough subtleties and nuances that it felt fresh and not simply derivative.  Oh, and Liane Balaban is fetching without working too hard at it.  
tt0364656;  Kevin Pollack is the best he's ever been as a down on his luck grifter, who gets involved in a scheme to steal some blackmarket Rolexes... which is just the start of dozens of twists and reversals in this wonderfully textured con game.  The film has a lot of heart underneath all the deceptions.  I can't say it's anything new in the genre, but that shouldn't matter too much. It's skillfully written and directed, with some beautiful, moody photography.  If you're into noirish, grifter pieces, then this should be right up your alley.   
tt0364656; Film Noir has not existed since the sixties, but filmmakers are incorporating the aspects of the genre into new films. Examples include Fargo, Se7en, L.A. Confidential, Pulp Fiction, The Usual Suspects, Memento, Reservoir Dogs, and Sin City.Canadian Gary Yates has written and directed a film that reminds us of the old days with the low lights and hard criminals, but in a comedy of cons conning cons. It may take a scorecard to figure out who is conning who, but viewers will be thrilled with the ending.Kevin Pollack (The Usual Suspects) and Liane Balaban lead this quirky and enjoyable film with a great supporting cast that will keep you guessing. 
tt0364656; One word sums this film up: average. It's a very average film, with nothing special about it whatsoever. The inherent problem in this film: too many twists and turns. Every second scene has a new twist, and there are so many that the film loses its sense of purpose. Yates tries to be so clever with all of the plot twists and turns, but there are so many red herrings and cons within cons that it's just overwhelming - and falls beyond the zone of believability. This film is trying too hard to be a classic noir, and the director can't decide whether he wants to be John Huston or Guy Ritchie. The only problem is, his script is nowhere near as sharp as the Maltese Falcon, his visuals nowhere near as crisp and noir as Huston, and he doesn't have any of the humour of Ritchie.And Pollack is no Bogart, Balaban no Bacall or Mary Astor. And the characterization is faulty - aside from Pollack's character (Harlan Jr.), the other characters simply don't stay true to form - they change throughout the film in ways that aren't just unexpected, but uncharacteristic. As well, Pollack simply isn't believable as the kind of character he's playing. His character is too genuine, too naive - and the way he ends the film (no, I won't spoil it) is a stretch. Yates is borrowing more than a little bit from Miller's Crossing, but Pollack is no Gaberiel Byrne - and he's also far from a Bogart or Fred MacMurray.As well, the middle sags horribly. From the frenzied pace of the beginning to the frenetic pace of the end, we have this slow and dreary interlude with a 'romantic' aspect that perhaps wants to be a red herring, but just feels false, shallow and out of place.As far as Canadian film goes, however - at least non-Quebecois Canadian film - this is a pretty solid one. Which doesn't say too much about Canadian film. We certainly have a lot to learn about film-making, but there are always moments where I feel that we're heading in the right direction. Not the best Canadian film I've seen, but nowhere near the worst, its flaws aren't serious enough to make you want to stop watching.In the end, this film tries very hard and brings forth some interesting and quirky characters, but falls short of its potential.Yates has something interesting going here, and he shows bright promise, but he needs to tighten up his script and gain a better understanding of film - especially film noir - before he can near that potential. Yates will get better, but he needs to take a step back and examine himself and his work first. 6/10. 
tt0364656; David Mamet's "House of Games" is probably the definitive "switcheroo" movie. It is highly entertaining, and highly recommended. "7 Times Lucky" is a failed attempt to create interest in a similar con game. Unfortunately the only con game here is the one being played on the audience. An unbelievably contrived script, and some truly uninspired acting, sinks this wannabe noir. There is zero character development, so who cares if in the first few minutes a guy gets hung upside down and has his toe cut off? Annoying flashbacks only add to the confusion, and all of this nonsense is wrapped in a Christmas theme no less. An almost incoherent, train wreck of a film. - MERK 
tt0364656; This is the story of Harlan, an aging small-time grifter, a relic of a bygone age who dreams of making it big. He is encouraged by his partner Fiona, who is young beautiful and treacherous, a classic femme fatale. The story could be taking place anywhere or at anytime, there are no geographical or temporal references. It's as if these cheap crooks exist in their own decrepit universe. The tale has more double-crosses and twists than I could keep track of. However it never looses you and keeps you engrossed until the end. What's best about this film is the acting from a fine ensemble cast and the wonderful black comedy that lies behind the story. Go see it - you won't be disappointed. 
tt0364656; I rented this film because there was a lot of buzz about it a few years back. It was shot in my hometown (Winnipeg, Canada).Unfortunately, the makers of this film clearly ripped off the main characters and most of the plot points from the classic French caper "Bob le flambeur". "Bob le flambeur" is a classic and a much better film. The producers should be making royalty payments to the Jean-Pierre Melville estate."Seven Times Lucky" is a mediocre film, and has some obvious weaknesses, mainly being a miscast lead Kevin Pollack. I cannot see Pollack in a million years in a relationship with the twenty-three years younger Liane Balaban. Balaban has a solid performance in this film, but I can not recommend renting it. 
tt0364656; This movie gives itself away as Canadian-made long before the suitcase of $CDN 100's is shown - it's low-budget, tight, low-key, relatively nonviolent, and features at least one name Hollywood actor or actress (artsy, or B-list) to give it some box-office appeal. Hence the movie features Kevin Pollack, a short, nebbishy character actor, who shows he's capable of carrying a certain type of flick by himself, in this case as an intelligent, hard-boiled grifter who doesn't let his emotions get in the way of doing business. Does having an aboriginal as a heavyweight villain make a movie distinctly Canadian? I'm not sure, but it's a refreshing change from post-Soviet Russian gangsters.In this movie each scam sets up another with various irresistible hockable valuables turning up to sweeten the pot and lure the crooked types involved. It all begins with a "sure bet" on the horses, and as the movie's characters are introduced at a goodly pace, we begin to wonder about which character is setting up which. Or are they scamming? The movie also does well with the subtleties and then the revelations about the various partnership combinations. Was it love - or just a scam? 
tt0364656; I didn't get it and I paid real close attention.I think they were going for more of a feel than an actual outcomes based production vis a vis a storyline that one can grasp.The intentional distortion of the time era via props and costuming further served to undo the film.Kevin Pollack is totally and completely wasted. His alternating between glibness and melodrama took things down even further as did the chronic overcast skies of Winnipeg. He even looked, very briefly, like Groucho Marx in You Bet Your Life.It's not worth the time, and I say that feeling badly because I sensed that they were really shooting for something specially and came up way short.

tt0190884;  In this suspense thriller, the plot thickens as Yancy Butler, who plays the convicted and now released on parole Sandy Dickenson, turns the tables on the crooked prosecutor Frank Sutton- that prosecuted Sandy Dickenson's case for the involuntary manslaughter of her husband. Sutton is in favor of her parole, admitting that Dickenson did kill her abusive husband in self defense. But she must do something for him in return - testify against a mafia king pin.As it turns out, Sutton uses the "witness files" to prosecute his tough cases as a way to secure witnesses. Then he murders them. In finding this out, Sandy turns the game on Sutton, leading to his arrest and conviction for her murder. The storyline is very creative and unique- there are no dull moments in this thriller. Butler lands a A+ performance in this suspense laden movie.A must see for all Yancy Butler fans! 
tt0190884;  Just saw this movie and Had to comment ! Mainly cause it was at this time rated 3.6 !!  Thats way too low for this kinda above average story and acting !  The Plot is Good and acting is above average of all concerned ! There's enough action to make it interesting and where does it say that a movie must have action from a to z ??  Not all can be as Lethal Weapon !  
tt0190884; A woman goes after a crooked DA in "The Witness Files," a 1999 film starring Yancy Butler, David Newman and Barry Flatman. Butler plays a victim of domestic violence, Sandy Dickinson, who killed her husband and was sent to prison. She is promised early parole by the DA who put her there (Newman) if she will pose as a witness to help him put away a mob boss. In order to be with her son, she agrees. Since she's a former actress, she's able to disguise herself as a street person and tell the police that she saw the mobster commit murder. Everything goes smoothly until someone tries to kill her.This is a far-fetched story but nevertheless absorbing, with the beautiful, throaty-voiced Butler handing in a fine performance as Sandy. David Newman is extremely likable as Dennis, the detective who falls in love with Sandy without knowing her true identity. And this is a plot hole - when it is learned that Sandy is missing, why did a detective working with the DA never look at a photo of her and realize she was the woman he fell in love with? As stated above, the story is a little out there.A good rental. 
tt0190884;  Great twist on the "corrupt prosecutor gets his just-due" genre.  Yancy Butler plays Sandy Dickenson, a wrongly convicted mother - released from prison by corrupt prosecutor Frank Sutton(running for higher office) played by Barry Flatman, who extorts her into giving false testimony to convict a crime lord to bolster his political standing aided by a gullible police detective David McCoy, played well by David Nerman, who Sandy seduces and manipulates into pursuing prosecutor Sutton....and with the help of Sandy's prison acquaintance con-family Sandy pulls off the ultimate "con".  The pace & film-making qualities of this movie are impressive, as is the editing. The best part is Yancy Butler's star-turn performance - her best to date. 
tt0190884; I completely agree with the previous comment, this movie should have a higher rating in my opinion. I thought that Barry Flatman, as the evil District attorney, did a great job at being slimy and mean. He reminded me a little of Micheal Douglas. Yancy butler is a wonderful actress and played each of her characters so well. I especially loved the role of the old lady! Amazing... The little boy, Justin, was so cute as her shy son.I am such a fan of movies that have twists and turns.... this one had it all. I don't want to say too much more as I don't want to spoil the movie. A clever movie with a super cast. ,o) 
tt0190884; Writer Cameron Kent has some good ideas but fails to make them gel in a script full of plot holes and improbable situations. The cast headed by Yancy Butler as target Sandy Dickinson do the best they can with what is given them. Perhaps the stand out performance is by Barry Flatman as archfiend Frank Sutton hiding behind the law for his nefarious schemes of self-aggrandizement, but no one is less than adequate for this suspense thriller.Sandy Dickinson is in prison for murdering her abusive husband to protect herself and her son, Justin (Matthew Harbour). Surprisingly, the man who prosecuted her on involuntary manslaughter charges, Frank Sutton, obtains a parole for her after she agrees to falsely testify for him against a mob leader. Unbeknownth to Sandy, Frank keeps witness files, hence the apropos title, on key witnesses who somehow end up dead. Sandy becomes a target for Frank's hit men but successfully eludes them by her own machinations and talents as a make-up artist. She is aided by a police detective, Dennis McCoy (David Nerman), and her friends from prison and elsewhere. That Sandy and Dennis fall in love doesn't prevent Sandy from using Dennis to deal effectively with Frank to get rid of him for good. How she does this is much too contrived but still entertaining.A bonus is the haunting music of Canadian artist Christopher Dedrick, particularly the closing theme. 
tt0190884; I would like to find out the name of the song and the performer that was the last song of the movie. It was played during the subtitles at the end of the movie. Who sang the song and what is the name of the song? That's it. I really liked the move and it held my interest the entire time. The actors were very convincing and attractive. The only thing I couldn't figure out was that it seems that the detective/investigator that was dating the the ex-con lady, Sandy, towards the end of the movie would have taken the time and interest to view a photo of the missing "dead" lady Sandy by looking in her prison files. There would have been a photo of her and an investigator would have wanted to see a photo of the person that is supposedly dead and missing. 
tt0266870;  Crossfire, or Pyrokinesis, is a movie made by the person who resurrected the Gamera movies.  If you have seen any of those, you know what Shusuke Kaneko can do with old ideas.This calls to question if Crossfire is a some sort of remake of Firestarter. The answer to this was best given by the director who stated that he was well aware of the movie Firestarter while making Crossfire, but didn't want to do a remake.  Instead he was going for more of a mature story focusing on the character emotions to a greater extent, and leaving the pyrokinetics as a secondary aspect.  The good news is that he succeeded.  Crossfire provides characters that are very complex.  Often in asian cinema the hero is not just your average "good person" as in many American movies of this type - instead you have someone walking in a sort of grey zone.  This is the case with the lead character Junko.  What she does to exemplify this is... well.. watch the movie.Needless to say, I liked the film a lot (even with difficult to read subtitling - white on white sometimes.)  There has been a lot of crap following in the footsteps of The Ring trying to be Japanese horror hits, but Crossfire stands out with its engaging storyline and amazing special effects.  
tt0266870;  The recent flow of horror films from Japan will be greatly helped by this entry! Not only does it suceed as a good story, but the special FX and action does nothing to deter from this.A girl, Junko, with pyrokinesis (the ability to set things on fire with mental strenght) takes revenge on some teenage, who run a snuff film business, and have killed the sister of one of Junko's friends. The first half of the film runs like a cop-thriller (like SEVEN) with two detectives tracking the killings of the teenagers, then the burnings that follow. The second half, however, lends itself more to horror-action sequences and could very well be some of the most beauitful footage ever filmed. Though a little slow moving, not so much, though, as other Japanese horrors such as the first RING film and TOMIE, it still manages a nice pace and suceeds on every level, not just as a genre film, but as a great movie all around.Catch it if you find it near you! 
tt0266870; Junko Aoki (Akiko Yada), is an average adopted shy young women, with one minor quirk: she can incinerate anyone in a ball of flame with but a thought. You see good old Junko was born with a certain brand of ESP called pyrokinesis. She falls for her co-worker Tada Kuzuki and feels a strong need to avenge the senseless death of Tada's younger sister when she's murdered by young street thugs. A chance encounter with a fellow ESPer, this one has telekinetic powers, an and offer to join a group of others called "The Guardians" starts a chain of events that will find poor Junko a target of the police. This film was like a Japanese version of "Firestarter", but a better and more mature take on the theme. VERY competently directed by Shusuke Kaneko and nicely acted, this rises above the source material to be an extremely enjoyable experience.My Grade: B+ DVD Extras: Intro & Subtitled Commentary with Director Shusuke Kaneko, 19 and a half minute Interview with Shusuke, a 17 minute Making of, 8 Theatrical Trailers, and Trailers for "Kunoichi: Lady Ninja", "Versus", "Pistol Opera", & "Samuri Fiction" 
tt0266870; Hot on the heels of what was at the time his greatest film, the dark and beautiful Gamera 3, Kaneko took a breather from the world of kaiju, and directed and co-wrote this adaptation of a popular horror novel. In his own words he wanted to attempt something more focused on human drama.While it the script does occasionally meander, it is refreshingly free of the self consciousness which taints so many similar films, (such as the X-men movies) and its earnest take on the ethics of revenge is served with a fascinating dash of moral ambiguity. What's more, it has a surprisingly powerful emotional core, and one scene in particular was so unexpectedly touching that it brought tears to my eyes.The film's greatest strength is its character development. The heroine, Aoki Junko, is one of Kaneko's most compelling characters outside of the Death Note films. The fine details of her everyday life, -such as the precautions she has taken against her own powers- add greatly to her believability, and her development as a person in response to the plot's twists and turns gives the film its backbone. Her hesitant attempts to connect with other people after a life of solitude are very touching, and provide a poignant Yin to the Yang of the brutal action sequences. Actress Akiko Yada's portrayal of Junko is strong and subtle, wonderfully capturing her emotional torment and moral uncertainty. The secondary characters and are also given a nice degree of ambiguity and depth, and are nicely acted to boot. Of these, the standout is Kaori Momoi as Ishizu, a shrewd, cynically jovial and compassionate female detective. These three qualities are a hard act to balance, but Kaori and Kaneko pull it off nicely. What's more, she gets a ton of awesome lines, such as this gem to a male colleague, "Don't look at me like that, you remind me of my dog."Though the passionate enthusiasm he brought to GMK and the Gamera trilogy is noticeably absent, Kaneko's direction is solid nonetheless. While his pacing could use some tightening, his characteristic uses of crane shots and character mannerisms are effective, and as with his kaiju films, his artistic composition turns what could have been merely serviceable FX shots into beautiful works of art.Speaking of the special effects, they are very impressive. While a few of the death scenes are slightly cheesy and fake, the pyrotechnics are overall spectacular, and the marriage of digital and practical techniques is daring and competent. It may look slightly dated today, but for a relatively low budget film made in 2000, it's an admirable achievement.Sadly, the score by Ko Otani is rather weak. It adds little in the way of tension or drama, and is quite distracting at times. Furthermore, it's a serious disappointment given his usually very high standards, and the magnificence of his prior score for G3. Overall, Crossfire has some flaws, but also enough strong positives to outweigh them. It may not measure up to G3 or the Death Note films, but it's still a well made and entertaining fantasy film with a lot more emotional depth than most of its stable mates. 
tt0266870; "Firestarter" we all know that one even if you haven't seen it. A girl who can control fire is used and persecuted because of her special powers. "ESPY"? That's an obscure one. It's a 1970's Japanese film about an elite team of telekinetics who fight an evil cult of telekinetics who are trying to enslave mankind. Shusuke Kaneko, who turned the laughable Gamera kaiju series into possibly the best giant monster movies ever made, reaches into the Japanese movie genre box and comes up with an entertaining if flawed "B" movie.Simply put, the plot involves a woman with pyrokinetic powers who is on a quest to destroy a gang of sociopaths who torture and kill young woman. She comes under the protection of a mysterious man with different telekinetic powers who receives orders from someone else. Along the way we follow two oddball police detectives as they try to capture the gang and figure out who is crisping the gang to death.Convoluted is a nice way to describe the twists and turns of the plot. There are a couple of scenes that don't make sense within the story. Some of the plot requires you to accept absurd coincidences and make ridiculous leaps of faith. The film "ESPY" had the same problems but as a movie it had a energy that made the problems go away while you watched it. Unfortunately, "Pyrokenesis" is not done that way, it's paced for a standard crime drama not a crazy action film. But overall it is very watchable.Why? The characters are almost all very interesting and the actors are all very good. The female detective is a funny character. You wouldn't think it but cramming a half a dozen different film genres into the film actually helps it. The special effects are mostly excellent. Kaneko really has a way with special effects and integrating them into his films. The only let downs are the human burning scenes that repeat the same kind of effects over and over. In "Firestarter" every bad guy got burned in a different way.It's entertaining, not great but fun. 
tt0266870;  Pyrokenesis is truly an entertaining film, although it's not as fun as the Heisei Gamera films by the same director, it sure was interesting. The characters are complex, unlike the few plain characters that are seen in Hollywood films, each character has emotions and background that are slowly shown throughout the film and not all shown at the same time. The highlight of this film other then the engaging story is the SFX, the fire effects are some of the most beautiful scenes seen in a film, especially when the female lead, Junko, is surrounded by burning flames as she tries to save her love. Sure, this film may be slow, but it's actually interesting to watch, a true Japanese horror film indeed. 
tt0266870; Sorry about the pun, but I really did enjoy this Japanese take on Firestarter. The acting is uniformly excellent, especially by lead Akiko Yada as the pyrokinetic Junko, and Kaori Momoi who gives a wonderfully atypical and original performance as Inspector Ishizu. The film has so many nifty plot threads that I scarcely knew what to expect next. It begins as a typical Carrie-type shocker, becomes a tragic romance, then veers into crime drama by introducing a gang of thugs who appear to kill for thrills. After that, we have a few plot twists which involve snuff films, a corrupt police chief and a mysterious band of vigilantes named the Guardians. That's a lot of plot for a horror thriller, and the movie carries it off beautifully leading to a final, explosive and exciting showdown in an amusement park involving all the lead characters.The special effects in this movie are among the best I have seen, absolutely impeccable, and this helps the film considerably. The pace may seem slow at times for western audiences used to breakneck action, but it pays off by making the action scenes here stand out and resonate with the audience. At almost two hours, the film is long, but it is packed with enough interesting characters, events and revelations to keep most viewers thoroughly entertained. 
tt0266870; The movie has a familiar ring to it: It bears a strong parallel in its primary idea to Drew Barrymore's power to ignite objects (including human victims) with spontaneous combustion in Firestarter. I didn't expect much from this movie, but its originality set it apart from that other movie, and it surprised me.Akiko Yada, as Junko, the character endowed with the gift/curse of the pyro-kinetic power, leads a spirited Japanese cast. A couple of actors over-do their parts, but everyone is convincing. Naturally, as more and more people learn the truth about Junko's power, several different individuals pursue her, each for opposing reasons. Junko herself is a pursuer, seeking vengeance against a killer. Many back stories, and the competing characters make for an involving story that moves quickly (and often violently). Those who would exploit her power are in abundance.Many innocents are close to the action, too, making for a good, suspenseful plot. It has a strange ending, which provides for a good discussion of what it meant with someone you viewed the movie with. This movie blends elements of suspense, science fiction, romance, and action very well. 
tt0266870; Translated from Japanese to English, Pyrokinesis is a fun little thriller film to watch at a party or sleepover. Pyro means fire in Latin, pyrokinesis literally translates to 'fires by force of the mind'. The film follows a woman with a strange ability with an unexplained cause, she can set fires with her mind... can set anyone on fire. After a brutal murder claims the life of one of her friends she becomes outraged when the law fails to help out. She uses her wild talents to go beyond the force of the law and becomes a vigilante with one thing on her mind... justice. Alright, admit it, the film DVD cover looks pretty cool. A woman on fire, coated in a sea of burning flames, the flames under her control! But all these films featuring humans with strange otherworldly powers end up the same. The production companies go out of their way to display a show of their CGI and SFX, showing these powers in an unrealistic way, showing off their film effects rather than work on the story itself. Let me see, I recall Village of the Damned (1995), Lucy (2014), Push (2009), Firestarter (1984), Akira (1988) and Carrie (1976). Each film does the same type of thing. Pyrokinesis is no exception, really. It's fun to watch but not really all that interesting. Expect some crazy light show of flames, it's full of 'em. 
tt0266870; Let me start out by saying I like all kinds of genres, but I don't really like drama films.This film was supposed to be a horror film.Well, I read a lot of reviews prior to watching this movies, even some from horror movie review sites/blogs, and now, having seen this movie, I'm thinking: "What??" First of all, this film is NOT a horror film, AT ALL. This is a sci-fi drama film. There is not an ounce of horror in here. If you were looking for that, then move along. Nothing to see here people.I started up this movie, expecting to see a horror film. I slowly realised that this is a drama film!Not what I expected, but it was a nice watch anyways, nothing I would re-watch later though. I recognized the guy from Burisuta here, so that was pretty nice, seeing a familiar face. 6* 
tt0979917; "Magnus" by Kadri Kousaar was a film chosen for Un Certain Regard, one of the side festivals of Cannes, but not in main competition. It was visually interesting, but the characterization and particularly the dialog were weak. It undermined the story. Especially as it is a true story about a father and son relationship and the father plays himself in the fictional film, and then gives a documentary testament in the final five minutes. In my opinion it was a very uneven film, beautiful in many regards but undercut by so much on-the-nose sturm-und-drang and weak character development (most of them didn't have names outside of Mother, Father, and Sister, and these were major characters). 
tt0979917; A weirdly rushed finale followed by the most unnecessary explanatory epilogue since Psycho makes foreign distribution unlikely unless the film is re-cut in its entirety. Persistently weak dialogue throughout the whole motion picture. I believe Kousaar tried to shock the viewers by focusing on gloomy Soviet sexual perversions like for troubled Magnus seeking a blowjob from his own sister. I thought that most of the sexual connotations were too explicit and unnecessary. As for the young Magnus, mostly he wanders about smoking and gazing at the sky with a puzzled expression to the sound of someone trying to murder a cello. When he phones his sister to tell her that today's the day he plans to die, she tells him to get on with it. Sensible girl. 
tt0979917; "Magnus" has something to say about love, parenthood, sex and suicide but not necessarily in that order. The problem is that its pretensions get in the way of us caring about its characters and really understanding what it's trying to accomplish. The title character is a lonely, confused teenager (played by Estonian pop star Kristjan Kasearu) who has attempted suicide at least twice. Much of the film centers around us watching Magnus as he wanders aimlessly through life, doing drugs with his dad, going to a brothel, asking his sister to have sex with him, etc. He seems totally bored and disinterested most of the time and while this may be part of his condition, it becomes contagious and we begin to feel the same way. One of the problems lies with the performance of Kasearu, who while extremely handsome is also mostly expressionless and never allows us into Magnus' head or heart. The other issue is with writer/director Kadri Kousaar's pretentious style which involves unnecessarily avant-garde camera angles and opaque lighting that quickly put us into an intellectual and emotional stupor. "Magnus" is a film that's so caught up in its own 'ideas' that it ends up leaving us cold. 
tt0979917; Kadri Kousaar's first film comes dangerously close to endorsing the views of its young protagonist, who besides being eager to end his own life is also a pretentious jerk. Delivered into the care of his prostitute-patronizing slacker of a father (played by the real-life father of a suicide), Magnus experiments with drugs, hits on his own sister, and ruminates on his childhood lung disease. Then he gazes upon a swamp for minutes at a time. The philosophical content of this movie is offensively crude.So far reviewers in Seattle (meaning SIFF) are not impressed. The showing is on June 2. 
tt0979917; ... when I arrived for this film 30 minutes before start time and saw five people in the ticket holder line and a dozen in the pass holder line that something was amiss. This is a stinker of film that collapsed under the weight of its pretensions. I gave it two stars for the beautiful shots of scenery but minus one star for the dearth of story, subpar acting and the director's pretentious tomfoolery with the camera angles, filming some scenes upside or from odd angles or through distorted reflections. Yeah, I get it: it was to reflect the state of Magnus's mind but a five minute shot of water or a three minute shot of Magnus staring off into space does not further the story and was ultimately boring and sleep inducing. Too bad too, because there were some great characters in the self absorbed modeling agent mother and the drug addict purveyor of porn father. BY FAR THE WORST FILM I've seen at the Seattle International Film Festival so far. 
tt0979917; I have serious ethical issues with director Kadri KAµusaar and Mr Laisk and I 100% agree with Estonian court's decision about invasion of privacy. Yet I was ready to give "Magnus" a try. But this movie is so bad that I am sure nobody would ever care talking about it if director didn't make a bad choice to pick real father of poor boy that committed suicide to play role of father in her movie. During only one screening "Magnus" got in Estonia (me and 3 friends attended) most people in theatre walked out after 20-30 minutes. Main problems (aside ethical) why I really did not like it - young pop star with no acting experience who played Magnus role was extremely unconvincing. Other actors - ever poorer performances. Photography - particularly monotonous with moments of pure lethargy. Now I can definitely say that "Magnus" is worst Estonian movie I have ever seen. All my friends and family in Estonia also give this movie not more than 1-2 stars. I am 30 years old, I am Estonian and this year I study for my Masters degree in USA. If you are looking for some good films by Estonian directors try "SA1gisball" (it means Autumn Ball), director Veiko A<U+0095>unpuu. Also try see "Klass", director Ilmar Raag.Â  It is drama film about young people and very depressing (you will cry 100%) but is real work of art unlike "Magnus". Â  
tt0979917; I am a huge fan of Eastern European directors, and think that with movies like Ilmar Raag's "Klass", RenA© Vilbre's "I Was Here", and Veiko A<U+0095>unpuu's "Autumn Ball", Estonia is - without a doubt! - becoming an important new hotbed of quality European cinema. Alas, "Magnus" does NOT fall into the category of Estonian films worth your attention -- a pretentious and hollow effort from writer and director Kadri KAµusaar, Magnus is possibly one of the worst morality plays to have ever hit the big screen.Â KAµusaar's self-indulgence is rampant, and her clumsy attempts to get us into young Magnus' headÂ simply put us to sleep. Insipid, frustratingly slow, and completely lacking an emotional edge,Â "Magnus" is alsoÂ riddled with remarkably bad dialogue: Being of Estonian descent I speak the language fluently, so no, I wasn't going by the English subtitles. Filled with amateurish acting and pedestrian photography ideas that do not resonate with the viewer, this film never finds a tone and completely fails to involve. Boasting sequences that seem disjointed, it begs to be re-cut all over again, possibly by someone professional this time. It took a lot of patience and endurance to get through the whole movie, and at the end it wasn't worth it. At best, "Magnus" can be viewed as an accomplished failure about children lost to suicide.Â  
tt0979917; It's beautifully told story about dark side of our life, about love (or lack of it) and life (or lack of it). But not only, it will give you some food for thought in many many areas. It's not ready-made fast food, you have to think along and thinking is not always easy thing to do. Being a parent will probably help you a bit. This film will tell you a lot if you care to listen.There is something this film does not tell you but it may be good to know - Estonia is one of the top countries in male suicides per capita and by large talking about suicide is considered to be taboo. That may explain negative attacks toward film and director in reviews.Technically it's not perfect movie, but it's good enough not to notice it while watching. Given virtually non-exciting budget - team has done excellent job there.Give it a try, it's not for everyone, but it's well worth seeing. 
tt0979917; First off, I couldn't watch a film of this genre every day, without feeling seriously depressed myself! Very few directors focus on the issue of teenage suicide, perhaps because emotions are contagious. However, once we accept what this film is about, you'll understand why I feel the implementation is excellent. What comes first always shines brightest, and that is just desserts to a team with the courage to cover this genre, even as it remains unpopular. There is teenage angst resembling Jake Gyllenhaal's Donnie Darko and spontaneous humour grounding Magnus's melancholy in our common world. Just as the Mayflower that first brought the English Separatists to America enjoys precedence over the QE2 luxury cruise liner, so this film has bravely staked its claim in virgin territory that a big budget film can now only imitate.The voting system only works for this film once you've accepted the genre as legitimate for artistic expression and comment. I feel the few low marks are an objection to the genre itself, rather than fair comment on the implementation. I would suggest that these accounts divert their criticism from the film Magnus to the genre: "Father and sister feel helpless to respond to teenage boy's lack of desire to carry on living." I would appreciate an outlet for people to vote on genres, so they don't distort the ratings for implementations within genres. As people we are all actors, not all in front of a camera, and the man who experienced a similar dilemma with his son is especially qualified to portray the rA´le he does.The Estonian legal argument that this film invades privacy is tantamount to a conspiracy of silence over the issues of teenage depression and teenage suicide. Maybe some children are born with an innate absence of desire to continue living. Only by free debate and sharing of research can we arrive at the truth on these issues - all the better to promote happiness and prevent suffering. 
tt0979917; Being an Estonian myself, I have to begin with by saying that this is one of the very few Estonian films I've seen that I WOULD watch even if it was not an Estonian film - in my opinion, it was well done, especially considering it being Kadri KAµusaar's first film ever, and yes, she is hated in Estonia, but no, I didn't feel her showing off in this film not once. It was Magnus's story and it was told in a beautiful and subtle manner, at times it was a bit artsy and might have contained too may scenes of Kristjan Kasearu (who surprised me quite a bit as well, as I really do not care much about his music) looking all dreamy and disturbing, but overall, it is a film that gets you hooked and does not let go. The bizarreness of dad-son relationship, the easiness with which the film treats the most difficult of subjects (and thus makes them shout and stand up even more), the haunting music - I was taken aback. On the other hand, if you're the type of person who minds when characters are unreal in films (don't have names, for instance) or is shocked by sexual references, it might be a good idea not to watch it after all, I suppose. But I think that for many people, this film makes sense, it clicks, and no, you don't have think that Magnus or his dad are normal or cool or whatever for this to happen - there are other layers to it than just the plot line! Oh yeah, and all the fuss about ethics and court banning the film - I would just like to know where to draw the line. To me, this film was a piece of fiction, probably even more surreal than what one usually gets in a mainstream blockbuster. Of course I'm not involved in the actual story and I have no idea how the mother of the actual boy feels, but it seems to me that now, with all the media attention, it might be even harder for her - and people will want to see the "forbidden fruit" even more. And they will. 
tt0208783;  First of all, this movies takes place in the Faroe Islands and NOT Iceland, as many people here think.I think it's great with movies from the Faroes, they are very few. However, making a roadmovie (at least this try) failed in the sense that people native to the islands, know that the road they drive on in one scene doesn't lead to the village in the next scene.But the characters in the movie are interesting. (spoiler) For instance, the character of the hitch-hiking girl is probably Katrin OttarsdA3ttir as a young girl. (spoiler end)That said, I believe that Katrin OttarsdA3ttir has made a good movie, that everybody should see. If you don't find the plot and sub-plot interesting, then at least look at the movie to see the spectacular scenery. Amazingly enough, I don't think there are any pictures of the capital, TA3rshavn, but Katrin has already made a movie in TA3rshavn, Atlantic Rhapsody (1989)I wish, that there were more movies made in the islands. Maybe even an action-movie with choppers and the lot. Definitely recommendable. 
tt0208783;  While watching this film I found my attention slipping from time to time. At other moments I was thoroughly enjoying myself. So my reaction to this film is mixed.Two eccentric young women, RannvA! and Barba, come to their native Faroer to find some connection with their past and their families. In the beginning of the film it seems, because of the women's erratic and provocative behaviour, that their only objective is to show the local inhabitants how extremely boorish and unsophisticated they (the locals) are. But through a series of seemingly unrelated events and persons we learn more about the history of both characters and the seriousness of their quest for belonging.Accompanied by their faithful driver RAoni, who himself is on a quest for work in an interesting but never fully realized sub-plot, they drive through the beautiful Faroer landscape. Their moods swing from the deeply tragic to the highly exhilarated.It is in these exhilarated moments that the girls really come to life and for me these were the scenes that I found most enjoyable. A feeling of genuine fun is transmitted through the TV-screen (I missed this one in the cinema) and this made me really like these women.The tragic scenes seemed to me a little over the top and did not feel very genuine, too much like two actresses desperately trying to convey an emotion they do not feel at that moment. It was in these moments that my attention wandered from the screen and it is here that I think this movie is mostly unconvincing.All in all still a very enjoyable, nicely paced film with good camera work and editing, conveying a slight sense of disorientation which helps in evoking the spirit the women are in. 
tt0208783;  If you see this movie, you'll first think it is very weird. Many students Danish at the University Of Amsterdam turned of their television after half an hour. But they were wrong. The weird but hilarious characters, the interesting plot and the good actors, it makes Bye Bye Bluebird I very good film.It is NOT the story about two aliens on The Faroer, it is a tragic comedy about two girls in search of their identities. A deeply moving film with an unexpected ending...And yes, I cried when I saw it. If you have any interest in danish, Danmark or The Faroer, you can not afford to miss this film! 
tt0208783; I must first note that, contrary to the previous reviewer's comment, this film is NOT set in Iceland. It is set in the beautiful and remote Faroe Islands. Funny, I am used to people referring to the Faroes as Denmark, not Iceland! I must also admit that my comments are somewhat biased because I have family that acted in the film and other family that sang on the soundtrack. I have also met one of the two lead actresses and know family of some of the actors. My family is from the Faroe Islands, you see. I saw this film at my college in Colorado, and was absolutely thrilled to see part of my life represented on screen. It was the first time I had ever seen a film in the Faroese language, even BARBARA - a film based on Faroese legend - is in Danish. There have been a couple of films before this one in Faroese, but I hadn't had the chance to see them (I have seen one since). I loved this movie for those reasons, but I also thought it was quite enjoyable in and of itself. I would have to see it again before I could speak more critically on it, since on the first viewing I was just so excited to see it all. But some interesting things to watch in this film are the hints of colonialism and the search for identity that I feel are such a part of the Faroese psyche. Notice the relationships with the Danes - who speak only Danish in the film, for those who don't pick it up. This film is also truly quirky, which makes it a lot more interesting to me than other road films. As a film grad, style counts a lot for me, since so many films are so devoid of it. Now if only this (and other Faroese films) could be released in the States! 
tt0208783; As "mulder" from Funningur, Faroe Islands, already mentioned in his excellent review, this film is a bit unrealistic to everyone who knows the real locations well. However, this is normal in very many films, so don't mind of that so much.Away from this, to any insider (people who know the Faroes) it is a great event to watch it. It is a MUST for Faroe friends and for sure something, the entire country can be proud of. A funny (and honest) story with great emotions in a unique scenery. Regarding the scenery: When I saw the movie the first time in German TV, it was by accident. I couldn't believe my eyes: "is it?!?... no... yes: FA¸royar!" This was almost such a strong moment, as visiting the Faroes in real live.So in respect of the achievement for Faroese culture and in relation to that: 9 stars out of 10 - waiting for another movie from there, which can reach the 10 :-) 
tt0208783;  This movie really touched me. It has many great features - the story, the humor and the location are just a few IÂ´d like to mention. It takes you on a journey not only across the Faroe Islands, but in a complete little universe of its own - in unusual colours and in an unusual language :-) DonÂ´t miss it!   
tt0208783; As a few others have said, before me, the movie is set in The Faroe Islands, not Iceland. That being said, I feel I must say that although it is commendable for Katrin to have made a movie set in and about the Faroe Islands, I cannot with good conscience say that this is a particularly good movie. Many aspects of it are just too clichA© and/or out there for me to have enjoyed it.One great scene in the movie, (spoiler) is when the two characters checked into the "hotel" and spoke french, thinking that the lady behind the counter didn't speak the language. (spoiler end) Great scene, and seeing as it was in the very beginning of the movie, I thought "Hey this movie seems alright"... Wrong! Even though it still had it's moments, they were all to scarce and far between all the rubbish and bad acting, that I again, was almost on the brink on turning off the TV, even though this was the first faroese movie ever made!!! I didn't turn the TV off... I watched the whole thing and ended up with the feeling off annoyance. That a movie, with the potential for being a good one, had to turn in to such crap just because Katrin threw all realism towards faroese lifestyle and people out the window, just so she could follow the road movie format...But in conclusion, this is a special movie for me, only because it is the only one of it's kind, and therefor I give it a 5, in hopes that there are more, and better movies to come...Spoiler! PS: When saying that the movie was out there, and not very realistic, I was in particular referring to JA3han A­ KollafirA°i getting his ass kicked by the gangsters... What the hell was that all about!?!? 
tt0208783; Although enjoyable and sometimes hilarious, this movie is poorly founded on a string of unbelievable characters and slow plot development while the emotional baggage seems to be referenced but not visualized. It obviously isn't a mainstream film, but even for art-house it is trying to be too mainstream-focused and it underestimates its audience in doing this. The movie is perfect for a dark Sunday afternoon, but don't expect it to get you in a more positive mood, for this, the film is treating its material (even the comedy) to heavily. Maybe the movie is best reviewed in comparison to its two protagonists, Rannva and Barba, both coated in glamour and good looks, but ultimately shallow, empty and pretentious. 
tt0208783;  Maybe another example, where an ambitious newcomer director hides the lack of a true story behind a road movie. This time with two weird young ladies returning to their Iceland home country.The movie isn't really bad, it is quite entertaining, sometimes a little bit funny, some scenes really 'breath life' - but only sometimes the two main characters seem really 'alive' (not a mere construction played by wanna-be actresses).If you want to enjoy the wonderful Icelandic countryside, I rather recommend 'Cold Fever' (also a road movie, but a really beautiful one). 
tt0208783;  A roadmovie about two young girls, who travels around Island in search of.. something.This is boring, boring, boring. What the director often tries to achieve in the visual art they often loose in the speed. And that`s the case here. Nothing happens, and things must happen in a road movie. It feels like being stuck in a chewing gum.Wanna see a road movie? See "Thelma & Louise" Wanna see a good Islandic movie? See "Hrafninn flA1gur" (or "When the raven flies")  
tt0087374; This Canadian production was completed in 1984, but held back from release. During the next few years, its star, Kevin Costner, became a superstar, but the movie still wasn't released. It took a few more years before the movie was finally released, being dumped straight to video. Watching the movie, it becomes clear pretty soon why no one was gung ho about releasing the movie. For a cheapie, the production values replicating 1920s Montreal are generally adequate, though a few scenes looks slightly skimpy. And the movie has the novelty of being about a communist hero. Though considering how brutal communist governments have been through history, it's kind of hard to root for this hero, especially since it's hard to get an idea of his various thoughts and feelings about many things. This may explain why Kevin Costner gives a very bland and colorless performance, having nothing to work with. The biggest problems about the movie, however, are that it's both incredibly slow and extremely boring. Most viewers will probably fall asleep before it reaches the end. Even fans of Costner (if there are any left at this point) would best leave this movie unwatched. 
tt0087374; Quite an interesting film indeed, very smoothly directed and easily played without ruining it by too much talking. The only thing I couldn't help thinking all the time was, that this looked as if it was a film by Alan Rudolph and even Costner and his way of acting looked a lot as if the director had intended to cast Keith Carradine instead. Even the soundtrack seems to imitate Mark Isham and if you close your eyes, it's sometimes hard not to be perplexed by the closeness to "Choose Me" or perhaps "The Moderns" - by the mood, not the story! The most surprising thing is, that the movie works, though. In fact, this is one of the best screen appearances of Costner I've seen, at least because he avoids the usual grinning and concentrates on the driven and melancholy character. 
tt0087374; Okay, so this movie is not wonderful but it's very entertaining. Kevin Costner looks absolutely gorgeous in this film, and his acting is pretty strong and convincing. The leading lady is suitably older than him, and also experienced looking. She gives one the feeling of an early 20th century lady of the night turned business woman, even though she has an 80's perm. The costumes are authentic and the film's locations are quite sexy and set the mood well. The death of his brother is quite corny, and I wanted Robert to stay kidnapped because he was jerk. The dialogue is b grade however and the plot is average. Overall this movie is worth a look, and is good for a night in. 
tt0087374;  I like Kevin Costner, I really do.  However, if I were him, I'd bury this unintelligible mess of a movie so far down on my resume it would take coal miners to find it.  It has something to do with a drifter returning home to find the family fortune gone, and his brother in trouble with local gangsters.  The drifter wants the money to finance a revolution in China for reasons that aren't made clear.  Dreadfully slow and extremely bad. 
tt0087374;  I picked this up on DVD for $4, because I knew I could trade it one-for-one at a used book store.  It was well worth the investment.There are some problems with this movie.  It's melodramatic for one.  It has some cornball dialogue.  It's just a little cheesy.The story has big romantic moments, but no big romantic leads.  The woman could be Kevin Costner's mom, and he wasn't the leading man women knew him as a few years ago.  Despite many sexy locations and moments, this film is asexual.In a way, The Gunrunner takes place in the naive, simple 1920s one might imagine after only having seen bad movie versions of the time.  It's a really interesting world.  I see this movie as a gangster-themed steampunk version of No Way Out (1987).  I mean, what other movie hero helps start the Chinese Revolution?  I was taken to a different place, and I didn't lose my suspension of disbelief along the way.  Only afterwards do I admit that it wasn't so great.  At the time, I was loving it.It reminds me a lot of The Boy in Blue (1986).  It's always good to see rare movies like this, and it's definitely worth the price of a rental. 
tt0087374;  This movie is a melodrama about a young gunrunner in the 1920's. It is OK for Kevin Costner fans only!!the movie was delayed until Kevin Costner became a household name!!If you want a great movie with him watch"No Way Out","Robin Hood:Prince of Thieves"  or one of his baseball games especially "Bull Durham"!!This movie will not be the remember Costner when he stops acting !!I will remember him from those titles above!!The only people who will take an interest in this movie will be his faithful fans!!!other than skip this slow action drama!! 
tt0289589; I do not understand why more people have not seen this movie and/or have voted on it. It's a very good way to spend an hour and a half,some evening with some popcorn,a coke and your lady or gentleman. I really don't believe this film will win any awards. It has action,sex,crime and a lot of surprises. In this elderly mans opinion it was a heck of a lot better than some of the highly rated garbage they have turned out lately. Lou Diamond Phillips, Edoardo Ballerini and the rest of the supporting cast did a fine job, with an average movie. Yes, I do know what opinions are just like. No, I do not know anyone connected to this film. I'm just not sophisticated enough to tear it up, like some seem to do with many movies.I give it a 7.   
tt0289589; It always amuses me when bad editing results in cars magically having regrown hubcaps that clearly flew off in an earlier scene - just seconds earlier.It struck me that the final car chase scene was very familiar, from the way the blue BMW zigzagged across the park and jumped the wall, followed closely by a beige Dodge Ram. I thought it was remarkably similar to a scene I remembered from a Steven Seagal movie, probably "Marked for Death" which I saw in the early Nineties. Then I noticed that the mag wheels had miraculously changed from alloy spokes to gold BBS honeycomb style wheels... and the shade of blue wasn't right, either. If you're observant, you can clearly see both Seagal and his co-star companion in the truck (supposedly now driven by Phillips, who elsewhere is shown to be alone in the vehicle) at various times, but most noticeably when it spins round and enters the sidewalk, and again as it gets back on the street.If you watch closely, you can even see those nasty Jamaican drug dealers from the 1990 movie in the BMW... in one scene there is a black hand hanging out of the passenger side window (when there's supposed to be no passenger at all in either car)You sort of feel cheated when they pull this kind of stunt on the audience. Did they manage to save so much money after paying royalties to the owners of the Seagal movie? Or did budget constraints prevent them from staging their own car chase and doing their own stunts..? I'm told that the opening car chase was similarly taken from another movie which I haven't yet seen.Recycling in general may be sensible and politically correct - but this is taking the concept too far. Moviegoers should be entitled to a partial refund - or free copies of the movies from which these scenes were lifted.Lou Diamond Phillips has done better work for decades. It does him no favors to be associated with a production which relies so heavily on disingeniously regurgitated material. 
tt0289589; Recap: Jack Lucas, a detective, is with no apparent reason suddenly the target of a set up meant to disgrace him, and finally to kill him. His gun stolen, which he didn't report, used to kill his superior officer. Lucas is now forced to stall that investigation and at the same time find out whom and why is trying to destroy him.Comments: A decent action/thriller movie that won't go to the history as one of the great ones, but good enough to watch a night. Some good shooting, some car chases and a mystery to solve. It is maybe the mystery that is the weakest point in the story. We are early given the answer to whom, but not until the end given the reason why. So the bad guys plot to destroy Lucas almost feel random and unmotivated all the time, instead of creating a feeling of suspense. And not to mention that the entire story hinges on the stupid decision not to report the theft of his gun. Combined it made it difficult for me to really engage in and believe the story. Had it cleared those two obstacles it would have been much better.5/10 
tt0289589; If you are a person who likes to check out made-for-DVD movies, there is one film company you should be aware of - and not for positive reasons. That company is Cinetel Films. More often than not in their movies, they use footage from big budget major studio films, and in "Malevolent" they do this twice. I didn't recognize the footage from "The Corrupter", but I certainly recognized the climatic vehicle chase as being taken from "Marked For Death". As for how the rest of the movie appears, it's low budget but has some decent production values like good photography. The script, however, leaves a lot to be desired. The hero makes some pretty dumb decisions along the way that prolong things - if he had been smarter, things would have been wrapped up much quicker. And when things are wrapped up, the movie abruptly ends - the movie really needed another scene after the climax. Not the worst movie made by Cinetel Films, but there's no real reason to seek it out. 
tt0289589; Although Lou Diamond Phillips is the star the Malevolent one in Malevolent is Edoardo Ballerini, a most diabolical serial killer who not only is good at his work, but pretty good at making cop Lou Diamond Phillips look like the guilty party.It's a rather far-fetched yarn that Malevolent is spinning. Some of the premises of the story and the motivations of Ballerini are quite illogical as Mr. Spock would put it, even from the evil mind of a serial killer who doesn't think like the rest of us.Kari Wuhrer who has done a couple of other films with Lou plays a topless dancer and someone that Ballerini is fixated on. She could provide the clues necessary to Lou to stop the freak.While all this is going on, Phillips is under suspicion due to a shooting incident where his former partner was found to be dirty. His new partner, Gwen McGee isn't quite sure she can trust him and she's cutting him quite a bit of slack to get the job done.Too many illogicalities keep Malevolent from being a top rate police drama thriller though the cast does its best. 
tt0289589; ... I have to say, this picture really holds your interest. You really feel for the detective being framed.The acting was great. I was at every turn and twist in the movie,glued to my seat anticipating the next move of the murder suspect and the Detective. You really want to kill this guy and get to the bottom of the crime. Also haven't seen such great car chase scenes since " Bullitt" and "The French Connection" Maybe I'm dating myself, but I will leave it up to everyone else.I would have given it a 10 rating ,but I missed a few minutes getting the "Popcorn"... 
tt0289589; Jack Lucas (LDP) is an LAPD cop on the edge. Putting him even closer to the edge of the edge is the fact that a psychotic criminal mastermind is trying to frame him for a series of murders. The obnoxious and annoying Oliver "Ollie" Chadwicke (Ballerini) has it in for Lucas and is going to slyly and shrewdly send him up the river. Fighting for his life against the bogus charges actually perpetrated by Chadwicke, Lucas must use his wits to defeat him at his own game. Teaming up with a stripper with a heart of gold, Jessica (Wuhrer), as well as his father, Warren (Argenziano), Lucas must not only defend himself against Chadwicke, but from the mistrust growing amongst his co-workers. Especially with Captain Pruitt (Bauer) breathing down his neck. Will Lucas get justice? Malevolent is a surprisingly solid and entertaining cop drama/thriller. It was smart putting LDP in the lead role, because he can easily carry a movie like this with his charm, charisma and acting ability. You could even say this is the continuing story of Jeff Powers from Extreme Justice. This isn't really an action movie, in fact all of the action was edited in from The Corrupter (1999) and Marked For Death (1990). Anyone who has seen those movies will surely recognize the footage. But at least Malevolent is open and honest about it, in its own way: both footage sources get large, easy-to-read screen credits at the end of the movie. Other DTV items don't do that. They try to hide their patchwork nature. So we give the movie credit for its openness.You have to take this movie for what it is, it's not going to change the world but it's really not bad either. In its quest to be gritty, or perhaps different, there are some horribly (intentionally horribly) edited sequences that are trying to be "cool". If the movie was just edited normally, that would have helped. Plus there are some highly clichA©d, even stereotypical characters, such as Lucas' partner Carla, played by Gwen McGee. But Ballerini did a great job as the baddie, he really makes you hate him. It's always nice to see Kari Wuhrer, we were happy she was on board. It was also cool to see Jack McGee, of The Quest (1996) fame as the bartender. Steven Bauer should have had more screen time as the captain. Also, Simon Rhee is credited as one of the stunt players.LDP even wrote the lyrics for the movie's most memorable song, "Pray For Dawn", a bluesy-type number. He should get more credit for being multi-talented. Fans of any of the cast members involved, DTV cop dramas, or fans of stock footage (we know you're out there), or anyone with some spare time on their hands might want to check out Malevolent.For more action insanity, drop by: www.comeuppancereviews.com 
tt0289589;  Where to begin?   This is one of the biggest pieces of crap that I have seen in a long time.  Come on my four year old sister could make a better movie with a camcorder.  This movie is extremely slow through the first hour, with little, to no sembalance of a plot or story.  Lou Diamond Phillips acting was sub-par as usual.  The editing was also very poorly done.  At one moment you are on one side, the the other, over and over again.  Then the ending leaves much to be desired.  The story, if you can call it a story has no closure at all.  The horrible ending is previewed by a car chase with a power ram and a bmw.  The power ram bounces around like a ball, it is pretty funny.  I strongly recommend not wasting your time on this movie.  It isn't even one of those bad movies that are entertaining because it is bad. This movie just plain SUCKS  
tt0289589;  Malevolent is a rather poor suspense/thriller starring Lou Diamond Phillips as a Cop.Jack(Lou Diamond Phillips) meets a man in a bar, they have a drink and talk.When the guy finds out Jack is a cop he gives him props calling him a real hero. He gives a toast to Jack and the glasses break.Jack gets a cut on his hand, when going into the bathroom Jack becomes light-headed. He falls too the floor and the man he had the drink with his standing above him.Jack then passes out when he wakes his gun is missing.The guy goes around killing people setting Jack up.We then find out this man killed Jack's mom.When we find out why he is doing this too Jack it really is rather dumb.The final 20min though do get better with a little suspense but by this time do we really care about what happens in the end?The answer is no.Even the sexy Kari Wuhrer can't save the film.Director John Terlesky Directing is rather bad.The editing was really bad the scene in the police station with Lou Diamond and Kari Wuhrer has to be some of the worst editing i have ever seen.The only reason i tuned into Malevolent is cause Lou Diamond Phillips is one of my fav actors.Lou Diamond seemed a bit bored here, while his performance wasn't bad i have seen him do way better.Maybe next time Lou.I give Malevolent 3/10
tt0289589;  SPOILERS, SPOILERS. This is a standard cop got framed police movie in which the cop tries to clear himself by getting himself in to more trouble. Off course there is a good-looking stripper (is this always so with cops or what??) who obviously temporarily moves in with the cop (in the Netherlands you get suspended if you do that because you lose your credibility). The only thing that's remarkable is the car chase where they and up in the shopping mall. This chase is stolen from the Steven Seagal movie "Marked for death". Only the close-ups are replaced. How cheap can you get!! If you steal then don't steal from Steven's movies because they're sacred. Maybe there should be a law which prevents stealing from other movies to begin with. The movie improves however because of the car chase so in this case maybe it should be an exception.  
tt3341832; Granted, I am not overly into the rituals, myths and mysteries of voodoo. But still, I am finding it rather interesting. And having read the synopsis for the movie, I decided to give this a go. With Danny Trejo on the cast list, it couldn't be all bad.I found this movie to be a mess, to be frank. The storyline was really jumpy and was basically everywhere and nowhere at the same time. As such, then the movie as a whole turned out to be less than enjoyable. Especially because the audience sit there without really knowing what is what and being unable to find a red thread throughout most of the movie."Voodoo Possession" doesn't make use of million dollar effects, but still, they pulled off the movie nicely enough. Whatever effects were there, were used nicely and served their purpose well enough.As for the acting, well people were doing good enough jobs. Just a shame that Danny Trejo didn't have a bigger role in the movie. Aside from him, then I can't really claim to be familiar with anyone there. And it is nice to see a movie with all new faces from time to time.I didn't particularly enjoy this movie, so it is a mere 3 out of 10 stars from me. 
tt3341832; I had low expectations for this movie and not even those were met! It was definitely one of the worst scary movies the I've ever seen, if u can even call it a scary movie!!The acting wasn't terrible but I definitely wouldn't say it was great. There is not attachment to the characters created, I can't even remember the names of any of them. So I couldn't care less when any of them were killed. And the so called monster was more like a giant cockroach so unless you are afraid of bugs it's not scary at all.The so called special effects were horrible and clearly low budget, especially the terrible stabbing scenes that were so unrealistic and left a lot to be desired. The music choices failed to create any suspense or even evoke the slightest bit of emotion.It was difficult to be scared of any of the possessed characters in this movie, each time they came on screen they made us laugh rather than create any terror.Overall the storyline was a bit hazy and hard to follow as it kept jumping in and out of different worlds, this was also hard to follow as the movie failed to hold my attention. This movie was missing a "falk in the road' 
tt3341832; Well if you are looking for a cool Horror film, then look else where, as Voodoo Possession adds nothing new to the genre, and is not any way a scary or thrilling movie. First of, i hate how these movies try to make attractive posters that has nothing to do with the film, the poster you see here on IMDb is quite misleading and looks cool, which is not the case with movie itself. Also using big names to market a film is a cheap thing to do, here they managed to pull Danny Trejo to appear in brief scenes, which add nothing to the movie as a whole.The Plot : it follows a young guy WHO travels to Hiati to investigate the disappearance of his Doc brother who was trying to use Voodoo to help heal mental illness, the older brother is helped by his girlfriend who is a journalist and gathers up a crew to accompany the older brother to help find out what happened to his younger Doc brother, once arriving in Hiati and into the mental hospital, creepy things start happening and the movie starts to dig in deep into Psychology and family dynamics which was more of boring drama than Horror.The worst thing about the film is the acting, most are complete amateurs, very poor acting that one can tell that these are actors. Even Trejo seemed out of it. Some actors actually show their excitements in being in a movie, total lack of professionalism.The other parts of the movie making was all amateur work, poor direction and camera work, awful soundtrack and score, poor audio editing. The movie screams low budget. And i don't have anything against low budget films, i had my share of watching some and they still managed to offer something good, but this one is truly awful.I can understand the effort and the desire to make this movie from the people behind, but they lack big time in producing something that looks cool and professional. If id make movie like this, i wouldn't want people to pay to watch it, maybe just post it for free on the internet. In short, total amateur work here, low budget film that lacks in all areas with cheap marketing strategies, not scary at all, avoid it. 
tt3341832; Actually maybe just don't watch at all. Even if possessed. I have seen worse movies than this, but that doesn't make this any better or worth while. Even an expanded role for Danny Trejo does not help the movie at all. He's is seen in bits that "explain" the why ... sort of. Not that it matters or you'd care.The acting isn't really good, though the characters do not really have that much flesh to them to make them rich. The effects are OK though, especially considering the small budget the movie probably has. If you have a heart for that, you might be inclined to like this a bit more. Otherwise as stated: watch something else instead 
tt3341832; Review: I was expecting this movie to be full of zombies with a totally terrible storyline, but it actually wasn't that bad. The acting was pretty bad and Trejo was only in a couple of scenes, after they had plastered him all over the poster, but the film is watchable, for a low budgetÂ independent movie. The monster near the end looked completely ridiculous, but I got the whole Haiti Voodoo magic concept which wasn't badly written. Don't get me wrong, it is pretty corny, but the reason why it is watchable is because there is some sense in what the brother is trying to do. Basically he is trying to find his brother who has passed over to the evil spirit world and he has to fight demons and his sketchy past. It's not the best storyline but I have seen worse. Anyway, if you want a movie t watch in the background then this isn't bad but it's definitely not to be taken seriously. Watchable!Â Round-Up: I hired this movie thinking that Danny Trejo was going to be in it, but he's only in a couple of scenes. Most of the movies that I hire with Trejo on the front cover is a total distribution ploy to get you to hire the movie because he is usually is the best thing in it. Its not because he is a brilliant actor, its basically because he usually kicks butt and his movies are so bad that they actually become funny. Apart from that, I haven't heard of any of the actors before so I can't really comment on there previous work or there careers. I personally don't think that I will see the actors again because they weren't that amazing.Â I recommend this movie to people who are into there voodoo type movies about a guy trying to find his brother who is tramped in the evil spirit world. 2/10 
tt3341832; Hmm, "Voodoo Possession" wanted to be quite the movie I'll tell yea! The plot was better than most, and you can tell a serious effort was put into this one, possibly, it's the budget that killed it. Can't believe I'm saying this, but, a bigger budget in this case could have translated into a good movie.So, what exactly will you be into? Well, overall OK acting, good plot, nice characters, but it couldn't really spread its wings at other chapters, like effects, jumps or even a nice built tension coming from the audio part. So overall I gave it a 5, cause it really seemed to have tried, but cause of the lack of money, failed to deliver more. I mean, even the set, considering you can't afford much, they found something quite OK and they manage to make the most of it.Of course, a movie like "Voodoo Possession" is not something I would normally recommend, unless you wanna throw an eye on the indie section, if you want more, then try "Extracted", has somewhat the same plot, not a horror tho, but one great movie.Voodoo Possession, made a hard start for itself beginning with the name. Shame too, the idea wasn't all that bad. 
tt0852940; A man comes to the office of the psychiatric Dr. Sammael (Joan Severance) claiming to be the demon Asmodeus (Kane Hodder), the torturer of the 13th level of the hell, and he would like to tell weird things. He tells that he had made a deal with Lucifer to become human again. He should knock-up his virgin sister Mary Elizabeth (Alison Brie) on the day that their mother died and she should kill six people and deliver the Anti-Christ, and then he would escape from the pit and reborn. When Mary Elizabeth gets pregnant, her stressed and abusive sister Catherine (Denise Crosby) does not believe that she is virgin, but their father and former obstetrician Albert Martino (James Callahan) examines his daughter and sees her intact hymen. Meanwhile the Church discovers the truth about Mary Elizabeth's pregnancy and sends the priest and former military Father Anthony (Eddie Velez) to spy Mary Elizabeth. She is dominated by the fetus and forced to kill a truck driver, Lars (Jorg Sirtl), who is the lover of her tenant and friend Jennifer (Azalea Davila), and Jennifer herself and eat their hearts and drink their bloods, but she believes that she has nightmares. However during the ultrasound, she realizes that she is carrying a monster and she asks her father to stop her pregnancy. But it is too late.The awful "Born" is a B-movie (actually a Z-movie) that believes that is a great movie. The result is a pretentious and disappointing production, with an incoherent and absurd story without humor and terrible acting and direction. The plot is a complete mess: there is a priest that is a hit-man and former soldier, a demon in existential crisis going to a psychiatric, a father that examines the virginity of his daughter, two female-demons (succubus?) that stand naked like a statue with both hands covering their sexes, a character that is a slut, and only exists to expose her beautiful body. There are many scenes with free and cheap nudity. But the worst is the acting: the unknown lead actress Alison Brie is histrionic, with ridiculous voices and grimaces. Sorry, Ms. Alison Brie, but I hated your annoying performance. I have not recognized Joan Severance, who has a good performance, since I still had the image of her youth. Denise Crosby performs a hateful character and like everybody, she got older but she is still a good actress. I believe that if the writer and the director had included some dark humor and assumed that this movie is a B-movie, the story might have worked better and better. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): "O Anti-Cristo" ("The Anti-Christ") 
tt0852940; I just watched that movie, and was pretty disappointed. I didn't expect much to begin with as the premise of the movie doesn't suggest greatness anyway. Sadly, it doesn't even manage to deliver just as stupid entertainment. The main problem is probably the acting. While I've seen far worse actors in far worse movies, the story would require some people to act out as violent maniacs, some others as people caught a in really stressing predicament, and they fail to deliver that. Although I watched the German release I watched with the original audio, so it's definitely not just bad voice-overs or anything like that. Added to that, the German DVD release seems to be cut, the killings are all pretty much left out, meaning that except for a few semi-gory scenes closer to the end the German release doesn't deliver as a movie for "gore-hounds", either. Can't comment on that for other releases of course. The plot has some stupid moments thrown in here and there and the beginning is just hilarious (ever heard of a demon visiting a psychiatrist?). Too bad the movie takes itself far too seriously, if it was filmed as a horror-comedy and changed a bit here and there accordingly it might have worked better. The ending is just a huge disappointment.If you've got really nothing better to do and just can't stand the boredom anymore you might (and it's really a weak "might") consider this movie. If there's anything else available to watch or do: Pick that alternative. 
tt0852940; I totally disagree with other votes against this movie!If you take it seriously, there are not many horror movie these days portraying about pregnancy(pregnant woman), which is a sensitive subject! They may receive bad critics or good one, but it is a sensitive section!If you do enjoy Inside(2008) and Baby Blood(1995) then this movie is yours.It tells a story about a 21-year-old virgin girl who went to bed and woke up pregnant. There's a few sex/nude scene which involved the main character but was limited to prevail the story. And we do need to pay much attention to pregnant girl who does a brilliant job (i guess she is pregnant for real?!) It's not a copy of Rose Mary's baby thanks to good performance! Although everyone keeps thinking about Rose Mary when it comes to this field! The ending was good too! 
tt0852940; Born combines a variety of ideas into one old-fashioned B-horror movie. There's a demon visiting a psychiatrist, a virgin pregnant by a demon, the same virgin fighting split personality- her innocent self and the demon taking over, a priest hit-man, an ultra-religious sister trying to keep the innocent girl on the straight path after their mother dies. And there's a surprising twist at the end.The performances are pretty good. Joan Severance is excellent. Denise Crosby is equally successful at portraying a nasty character. But Alison Brie impresses playing her role, two roles actually, with bravura. Kane Hodder was somewhat uneven, but it's good to see the legend play a significant role where he even gets to be funny at times.The CGI effects are pretty bad but fortunately not used a lot. Much better are the real prosthetic and other special effects. There's neat scene of a pentagram on the floor with talking decapitated heads at each point of the star.Overall an fun little movie that suffers at times from a slower pace. But at a time when horror movies are either lame PG-13 sequels or direct-to-video C-budget movie experiments, this is more akin to the 80s B-horror movies, not perfect but with everything a horror fan likes: violence, gore, nudity, humor. 
tt0852940; I'm not sure what I was expecting but I did think the 'plot' sounded good. Overall I was very disappointed with this movie. The acting was terrible, the scripting wasn't much better and the effects were even worse.I stayed till the end as I am not one to quit half way through. This movie felt like it had been on for four hours, and not enjoyable ones. I am not sure about the horror genre, I would place it in more comedy horror - even though I am not sure the parts which were funny were actually meant as comedy.Very disappointing and it is only getting such a high rating from me as the plot of the movie is a great idea, if done well. 
tt0852940; Friday the 13th's own KANE HODDER stars as a demon from the 13th level of hell (paying homage to his Friday the 13th films he starred in?) who assists a demon that is actually the anti-Christ set to be born of a virginal 21 year old girl who is living with her family. The usual screeching profanity, pentagrams, cults, blood sacrifices, overabundance of nudity, sex & gore that usually accompanies these kinds of films (at least of the B movie kind) is all here in abundance, but it lacks just one thing to make it stand out & be memorable, originality! I mean what happened to KANE HOODER? It seems like after losing the role of Jason Voorhees he's settling to just star in whatever script comes in the mail & a lot of them are some truly terrible films (Director Richard Freidman's DARK WOLF/DEAD NOON etc.) & now this, I mean things really couldn't be that hard on the guy could it? Kane's a pretty good actor with or without monster make-up on, though one who is not familiar with the actors work especially if they see this one ahead of any of the other films he's been in will have a hard time seeing it. Now I will give the film some merit, it's better directed than most supernatural B movies, & the acting is quiet good. The film also has a couple of hot blonde chicks twins & Mary's (the lead heroine) friend is also pretty hot. The film is also not ashamed to pile on the gore as we see plenty of head trimmings, blood drinking, heart rippings & in one of the films more painful moments, a chewed off...well let's just say it has other gory mayhem to help wet the appetites of gore hounds & leave it at that, but it never does reach it's true potential & will probably flee your mind once you remove the DVD from the player. A bloody but boring horror movie. Won't someone please rescue Hodder from this junk? Saved from my zero rating due to it's decent gore effects, acting & hot chicks.** stars 
tt0852940; Just to save you money and time I will go ahead and tell you that this movie is absolutely not worth the match and gas it would take to burn it. Don't waste your time. As a matter-of-fact you would be better off forgetting you ever thought about watching it. I have seriously seen better B movies in a language that I can't understand. Who ever gave permission for this to be made needs to be sewed. The only positive thing I can say for this movie is that with a new script and the right director and actors it could be a great story. Let me break it down, A virgin gets pregnant by a demon, the baby while inside her womb wants to feed on people. They try to make up for the fact that this is possibly the worst movie ever made with cursing and pointless nudity. All in all Totally not worth the dollar it took me to rent it. 
tt0852940; Born starts as a demon torturer from the 13th level of hell named Asmodeus (Kane Hodder) request to speak to Dr Sammael (Joan Severance) a psychiatrist, he admit that he is a demon from hell & that Satan stole his soul & that they have agreed to a deal in which he gets it back & for him to become human again. Asmodeus tells Dr. Sommael that he raped his sister Mary Elizabeth (Alison Brie) on Earth & got her pregnant, still a virgin Mary Elizabeth's family believe that it's some miraculous act of God & possibly the reincarnation of Christ but Asmodeus knows different. The demon baby is due to be born on the 1st November, an evil Satnatic festival called the Day of the Dead. Leading up to that time the demon baby needs six sacrifices & possesses Mary Elizabeth & makes her kill in order to get them. Is Asmodeus crazy? Can Dr. Sommael help him? Or is there some truth to his bizarre story?Produced & directed by Richard Friedman I am not entirely sure that Born was made as a comedy horror but if it wasn't then it sure does a good impression of being one & an entertainingly daft one at that. According to the IMDb there's a version of Born which runs 105 minutes, one which runs 107 minutes & the so-called 'original version' runs 118 minutes, I definitely saw the two hour cut & even though I wonder what the shorter version has cut out I have no real desire to find out. The script by Alex D'Lerma who also stars in the film as Father Nick the murdering Priest plays like various religious themed supernatural horror films, the likes of Rosemary's Baby (1968), The Omen (1976, 2006) & The Exorcist (1973) all readily spring to mind while watching Born & you can clearly see their influence on it. Even at almost two hours I quite liked Born, it just about kept my interest, the plot keeps moving & I didn't find it boring either. There are some truly bizarre & oddball moments in Born, a demon from hell seeking psychiatric help, said demon raping his sister, Mary Elizabeth's strict religious sister, her slutty friend who works on sex chat lines, Mary Elizabeth's nipples oozing green goo, a former assassin turned Priest, an albino graveyard caretaker, a few off the wall twists, cannibalism, heart removals, demonic possession, Satanic rituals, sex, castration & Joan Severance as Satan, what more do you want? The film is a bit of a mess but it's a funny & often amusing mess which kept me entertained for a couple of hours, Born isn't any sort of masterpiece but I found it fun & somewhat likable for all it's faults & in spite (or maybe because of) it's strangeness.Director Friedman does alright, the film looks a little cheap & there are some really sloppily edited & put together scenes (at the start in the graveyard there's a shot of the sky full of clouds as lightening strikes but in the next shot on the ground the sky is perfectly blue, the car crash looks poor too) but that adds to the light hearted tone, had Born taken itself seriously then these flaws would be much harder to forgive. There's some decent gore here, from decapitated head, headless torso's, ripped out hearts, a bit of cannibalism & blood drinking, a scene in which Mary Elizabeth's stomach is sliced open & someone has their throat bitten out. The film isn't shot with any great style or flair.According to the IMDb Born had a budget of about $5,000,000 which I find impossible to believe, there's no way this cost that much & I don't care what anyone says. If it did cost that much then I really can't see where all the money went since the entire film virtually takes place in the same house. The cast plays it up & seem to be having fun, I quite liked Joan Severance in this although I have never seen her so blonde, horror film regular Kane Hodder has a bigger role than he normally does while Alison Brie puts in a spirited & fairly likable performance.Born isn't the total disaster I was expecting, I usually despise these low budget shot on a camcorder type horror films but there was a something about this one. I don't think I could recommend it since it's an acquired taste but for what it is I quite liked it. 
tt0852940; This movie was by far the best ever... I think whoever shot it with the Sony hand-held camera was a genius and the special effects were spectacular especially the chicken breast heart...thank goodness this movie only cost me a dollar to rent.. Also the green toxic boob discharge was amazing......I could have shot this movie with my friends in high school. .................................................................... I would not recommend this movie to anyone ... you might want to kill yourself instead of watching it..... I also feel like this was a move for porn stars trying to make it into the legitimate movie business............give it to her Larz 
tt0852940; Seriously, all these Satan comes to Earth movies always involve the Catholics. Why doesn't Lucifer ever mess with the other denominations.The plot is that Asmodeus (Played by former Jason Vorhees Kane Hodder) has a plot to become human (but wasn't he always a demon) by getting this young girl who is his sister pregnant with his child. Except maybe she isn't his sister. The plot isn't clear on this, and they inter-splice these scenes where he is seeing a shrink about his problem.The lead girl gets pregnant while still a virgin, with an incredibly creepy scene of her father giving her a gynecological exam to prove her hymen is still intact.... Eeeewwwwww. Her sister (played by a washed up and looking much worse for wear Denise Crosby) concludes that this is a sign from heaven. Praise be! Well, the demon baby takes mom's body for a joy ride and picks off, in order, a truck driver, her friend's boyfriend and her friend, all being watched by an ex-military priest whose mission is to kill the baby when it is born. We discover that Asmodeus is actually a Catholic Cardinal who is running the whole thing.The ending is pretty much incomprehensible, and if you could make it that far straight through, you have a stronger stomach than I did. (I paused the film a couple of times, it was so awful.)

tt1172974;NA
tt0051840; A project very close to director William Wellman's heart, this semi-autobiographical account of his escapades in the title organization during WWI only partly succeeds. Hunter is a shiftless and troublesome youth who, after stealing a car and causing an accident, decides to enlist in a French air corp which allows American men to wear French uniforms and fight the war against Germany (the U.S. not having entered the war at this point.) On the sea voyage to France, Hunter meets up with older man Janssen and young, eager enlistees Hover and Wellman Jr (playing his own father.) They've scarcely downed their first glass of beer in a cafe when Hunter falls under the spell of misty-eyed French girl Choureau. He disappears with her for ten days, only resurfacing in time for his adventures in the Escadrille. The men are shown training for their flight careers in a comic, credibility-straining way with a bumbling Drillmaster barely able to communicate with them. Eventually, they take to the air and help the cause, though Hunter (due to his obsessive love for Choreau) runs into more trouble than he was in to begin with! Here the film becomes less about the Lafayette Escadrille and more about the troubled and contrived affairs of the young lovers. The films strengths lie in the cheerful, fraternity-like interactions of the men (even if narrator Wellman dwells on each one in the beginning, denoting their ultimate fate before the viewers have even met them), many of whom are played by actors who were just on the verge of greater things. It's interesting to see men like Halsey, Hutchins, Laughlin and especially Eastwood in these roles, though their lack of screen time ultimately becomes a bit of a frustration because their fame lends their smallish roles more weight than they were probably meant to have. Another big plus is gloriously handsome and beaming Hunter, though his looks are altered part way through the film. His charm is utilized throughout to help smooth over his character's selfish and foolish edges. It's also nice to get a glimpse into this little-known aspect of WWI and Wellman clearly wanted to bring various remembrances and details of his experience to the film. What doesn't work is the unevenness in tone of the film. It sways wildly from slapstick comedy to soapy romance to documentary to action. The title suggests a survey of the air corp along with action and aerial sequences (which do occur), yet the film turns into a "Let's Play House" love story complete with unintelligible murmurings from Choreau and a loopy, boozing, one-armed hotelier. This division of focus does more against the film than for it. Though he did manage to carve out a minor Hollywood career for himself, it should be noted that Wellman Jr, though amiable, gives a very stiff, flat performance as his father (though it couldn't have been easy to step into the role and be directed by Wellman Sr!) Hunter is beautiful and gives a committed performance. Janssen doesn't get to do a lot more than smart off and the rest of the men don't appear all that much (but they do show off their attractive physiques occasionally.) There is a (non-PC by today's standards) hilarious little part played by Nakamura as the men's human alarm clock and coffee pourer. In all, an okay film that could have been much better if the focus had remained where it belonged, which is on the fighting men of the Lafayette Escadrille. Studio tampering led to a happier ending for Hunter's character than was intended, much to Wellman's dismay. 
tt0051840;  **Spoilers Included**I saw a documentary on William Wellman, one of the best directors Hollywood ever had.  I am a big fan of several of his older movies, most notably "The Ox-Bow Incident."  He discussed this movie, said he liked it but the studio made him change the ending.  It was a dear subject to his heart since it was autobiographical.Tab Hunter plays Thad, who was abused at home and causes an accident with a car so goes to France to help the French fight the Germans.  You get some comedic touches at this point because none of the Americans understand a word their drill instructor is saying.  They include David Janssen and a very young Clint Eastwood, so young he might have had his high school diploma in his back pocket.Thad strikes the drill instructor and is put in jail.  His buddies get him out of it but he has nowhere to go so ends up with the girl he met when he arrived.  Their language barrier is touching as they both try to communicate.  But he can't leave the house, can't be seen outside since he escaped the military jail.  They eventually get married in her apartment, and at the end get married for real.I never saw Tab Hunter in a movie before.  I assumed, incorrectly, that he was a no-talent pretty boy but that was not the case.  He gives a very thoughtful and real performance.  It made me want to see more of his movies.I'm glad I saw this, even if it didn't turn out exactly as Wellman had wanted.   8/10. 
tt0051840; Starring a young Paul Newman and, in his first major role, Clint Eastwood, director William Wellman returned to the theme of his Oscar-winning Wings and his own experiences as an American pilot flying for the French in World War One with 1958's epic Lafayette Escadrille, a fitting swansong for one of the great directors of the golden age - or at least that's what SHOULD have happened. Instead Jack Warner balked at the budget, insisted on casting Tab Hunter instead of the lesser-known actors (Eastwood's role went to David Janssen, leaving him in a small bit part), added a happier ending and cut the film to ribbons in post-production before changing the title to Hell Bent for Glory, with the bitterly disillusioned director never making another film. The scars are all too visible in the rushed pacing and jarring plot holes left by scenes that never made it to the final cut, the opening of the film in particular looking like someone attempted to crudely shoehorn 20 minutes of plot development from an already badly compromised script into five minutes of surviving footage that looks like it's been edited with a lawnmower.Some moments do survive, but they're few and far between. The heroes' first night in their barracks moves from a flat comic scene to a quietly mournful one where Wellman's own narration identifies of the real-life pilots sleeping alongside them by name and describes their impending deaths, and its here that you see the kind of no-nonsense tribute to the friends he left behind that he so clearly wanted to make. Wellman himself is actually a supporting character in the film, played by his own son, while Tab Hunter's hero isn't a million miles away from the kind of troubled delinquent 'Wild Bill' was himself, a spoiled brat running away from a hit-and-run accident (it's tempting to see Wellman's original ending that saw him die as a kind of survivor's guilt that so many who survived the Great War when 'better' men died sometimes expressed).Unfortunately the result is just a flat, Earthbound backlot melodrama with some variably staged service comedy that abandons the fledgling fliers at the halfway point as Hunter deserts to marry Etchika Choureau's hustler-turned-nice-girl. Choureau's a pretty girl and there's a nice sequence with her blowing on the sleeping Hunter's face to wake him up, but they never make a strong or convincing enough couple to make you regard their romance as anything but a distraction from what a film called Lafayette Escadrille should really be about. The film rarely gets off the ground and does little that's interesting when it does, becoming surprisingly dreary in the mid-section with Hunter hiding out in her apartment and making a furtive living trawling bars and persuading servicemen to visit one of the local brothels. Naturally his conscience gets the better of him when the film finally realises there's a war on (something there's very little sense of for most of the running time) and he rejoins the squadron, earns his wings and the film finally gets round to having some aerial footage and a dogfight in the last reel. This footage is often quite good, but it's too little too late, feeling arbitrarily slapped on. Worse, there's no real connection to or affection for the character to get you involved, something that would have been just as big a problem had the original ending where Hunter died and his sweetheart committed suicide been retained. All in all it's a sad swansong for a great director and a poor memorial to the pioneer air aces he flew alongside. 
tt0051840; I saw this movie while stationed on the USS Franklin D. Roosevelt CVA42 sailing in the Mediterranean sea in 1959. It's true that it was more a romantic than an action movie. However, at the time I was thinking more about meeting women than flying airplanes, and I was completely caught up in the engrossing love story. It was a movie that I walked out of on air, and couldn't get out of my mind for months! My visits to Med ports such as Cannes and Nice, France, Majorca and Barcelona, Spain were totally changed as I looked for, and eventually found, a real-life Renee (although in Majorca not France).The true action movie of this story has now been made in the form of "Flyboys", which I just saw and liked also. The story had a bit of the romance in it, with a very appealing French girl as well, but told much more of the flying, and heroic side, of the story. Aside from some hooky computer effects, this was a great flying tale, appealing equally to the flier and action fan in me.Both are highly recommended. 
tt0051840;  There isn't much here more than a great director's swan song. Tab Hunter's acting is pretty good (!?) but not enough to lift the drab GI-in-love-with-a-French-woman theme. Most of the flying scenes don't match the ones from the director's 30s films. If you're interested in the director's career, don't skip this, you'll enjoy the themes and the depiction of air combat. Also Leonard Rosenman's score is a stand-out. But if you're not a Wellman fan you won't remember this a month after you've seen it.  Wellman is one of the great American directors, see everything else and watch for the evidence of his skills that are sadly not to be found here. 
tt0051840; This movie is another one on my List of Movies Not To Bother With. Saw it 40 years ago as an adolescent, stayed up late to do so, was very annoyed to find that it was about 95% romance,4% everything else, 1% history if that. It's what I call a bait and switch movie, one with an interesting title, the actual movie is a scam. This is a subject which deserves a good cinematic treatment, this movie is almost an insult to those who served. The actual members of the Lafayette Escadrille were not on the run from the law nor were they the products of abusive homes, they were in reality idealists who wanted to do something to help France. And I suspect many of them came from a more upper class background than Tab Hunter's character. Flying school is not for the smart alecks and the know it alls, an individual such as the one portrayed here wouldn't have lasted two days, it would have either been the stockade or the infantry. Discipline in the French Army was often rather fierce. In short, another Hollywierd version of an historical episode that deserves proper treatment. 
tt0051840; The Lafayette Escadrille was a group of young Americans who in 1914 could not wait for time and circumstance to bring America into World War I on the Allied side. They enlisted in the French army and were trained as aviators. One of those young man was a spirited rebellious young man named William Wellman.In fact Wellman is played here briefly by his actor/son William Wellman Jr. in what was William Wellman's swan song to films. It's all together fitting and proper that Wellman's last film be about the thing he loved even more than motion pictures, aviation.Bill Wellman made a lot of classic films and many like The High And The Mighty, Men With Wings, I Wanted Wings, Island In the Sky had to do with aviation. What's unusual about Lafayette Escadrille is that it did not concentrate on the war and the aerial combat. Instead it's coming of age story of a young man who enlists in the Lafayette Escadrille for all the wrong reasons.Tab Hunter plays a young juvenile delinquent named Thad Walker who to get away from home enlists in the Escadrille. He's there and still doesn't take to discipline. He does however take to Etchika Choureau and it's the call of the hormones rather than the call to the colors that Hunter responds to.Some of the comic moments are with the language difficulties as the French officers and non-coms try to drill the young Americans with neither understanding a word. But when Hunter hits Marcel Dalio and then breaks stockade to be with Choureau, he's down as a deserter.Two things immediately struck me about the film. The first is that in his final film the conservative William Wellman decide to test the almighty Code. Hunter can't get any legitimate work while AWOL if such a term exists in the French military. He has to go to work for French madam Veola Vonn as an escort, she's connected enough to provide some limited protection. Had Lafayette Escadrille been made a decade and a half later, you would have seen Hunter as a most explicit male escort for both sexes. Still it was a daring enough idea for 1958.The second is I'm wondering who back in the day in the Lafayette Escadrille was Wellman's inspiration for the story. It is in fact his original story that we're seeing. We do know that the happy ending that the film has is not the one Wellman wanted. But I guess you couldn't bend the Code too much. Among other treats in store in Lafayette Escadrille is a nice supporting cast of young players who would be making their marks soon enough as the members of the Escadrille. Tom Laughlin, Will Hutchins, David Janssen, and down the cast even further are James Garner and Clint Eastwood. Though it's not the film Wellman wanted, it's still a nice tribute to his comrades in the Lafayette Escadrille. Good thing that one of them lived and lived long enough to tell their tale. 
tt0051840; The films involving early flying, aircraft and the conflict of air battle are very interesting. However, due to the limited equipment and the lack of good directors and writers, the earliest offerings of movie flying are greatly lacking. The late great Howard Hughes did one called 'Hells Angels' which was not bad, but difficult to follow. This is one of those attempts. The casting is overloaded with prime star material, in fact this movie has some of the best aspiring talent in Hollywood. If you'll look closely, you'll see, David Janssen, playing Duke Sinclair, Clint Eastwood playing George Moseley, Tom (Billy Jack) Laughlin as Arthur Blumenthal, Paul Fix as the General and Will Hutchins as Dave Putnam. Tab Hunter is Thad Walker in this story which is more love story than W.W.I fighting epic, is fine for it's day, but somewhat of a sleeper for modern audiences. Nvertheless, a good offering of primitive flying and fanciful storyline for it's time. *** 
tt0051840; William Wellman's soaring aerial drama, "Wings," won the first Academy Award for Best Picture in 1927, and, three decades later, the director returned to World War I flying aces in his 1958 picture, "Lafayette Escadrille." Although Wellman's second depiction of early pilots and dogfights pales in comparison to his first effort, the film nevertheless has its moments. The aerial scenes, well photographed by William H. Clothier in black and white, are reminiscent of the earlier film. Evidently shot in the air, the fragile aircraft sweep across the French countryside, well, California actually, and we get point-of-view shots of pilots in their cockpits, similar to those in "Wings."Although Tab Hunter was never known as a great actor, he plays young American troublemaker turned expatriate pilot, Thad Walker, quite well. The handsome blonde is hunky eye candy and quickly falls under the spell of equally blonde and winsome Etchika Choreau. Unfortunately, the film details the romance, trials, and tribulations of the dewy-eyed pair, which border on the clichA©d, and neglects the camaraderie of Walker's fellow pilots and their daring exploits in the air. Among Walker's neglected comrades are a pre-"Fugitive" David Janssen, a pre-"Billy Jack" Tom Laughlin, and Brett Halsey. Oh, and there is another young actor among the pilots, a tall good looking guy, Clint Eastwood, whose subsequent career would overshadow those of both the film's star and its Oscar-winning director. Albert Sidney Fleischman's screenplay has problems with credibility and evasiveness. Despite his wholesome demeanor, Walker is supposed to be troublesome, having suffered at the hands of his father. His conflicted behavior results in some melodramatics involving a French officer, the stockade, and desertion, none of which is convincing. Seeking a job because his "wife," who may or may not be a lady of the evening, is supporting him,he goes to what viewers may perceive as a madame to work at what the audience may construe as a pimp. Not only are the proceedings purposely vague in a 1950's Production Code way, they are at odds with the character as we perceive him and certainly at odds with the image Tab Hunter enjoyed. In "Wings," Wellman focused on the aerial spectacle and relegated the personal stories to supporting status. With "Lafayette Escadrille," he goes in the other direction. If the drama had been as compelling as the dogfights and biplanes, the movie would have been successful. Unfortunately, the travails of two beautiful people do not sustain interest, despite Tab's often well-exposed torso. Despite the flaws, "Lafayette Escadrille" is not a disaster and worth a look, the aerial photography is good, the vintage planes are wonderful, Tab's muscles are well defined, and young Clint is obviously on his way to a brilliant career. 
tt0051840; ***CAUTION SPOILERS AHEAD***This film is a depiction of American Flyers flying for the French in World War I. Tab Hunter joins Clint Eastwood and David Jansen in their early roles. Eastwood has very few lines if he speaks at all in this film. The film is very silly to be a Wellman film. Tab Hunter goes to fly for the French after he's caught stealing cars in his neighborhood and damn near kills a man in doing so. So after a tense confrontation with his father, Hunter hops of a slow boat to France where he nor any other member of his group can speak a word of French. Somehow, Hunter get's mixed up with a French Girl and it's obvious that he has his mind on her throughout most of this film. Hunter then is imprisoned for striking his drill instructor. So to get him out, his buddies start a ruckus to distract the guards and they get him out to flee to the big city to hide with his girl. After pleading with an officer to get him back in the air after screwing up so many times, Hunter get's back in the war and shoots down a few German planes and then wins over his girl. That's about all to expect from this movie. Leonard Rosenman's score is very good and William Clothier cinematography isn't bad but that really all this film had going for it. Don't let the cover art fool you because it's meant to make this film look more interesting than it really is. **1/2 out of **** 
tt1390397; I cannot understand why this film has such a low rating when nobody has a really bad word to say about it.Somebody described it as a big budget film.I wonder how many films these days cost $2000000!I saw it at the cinema and was gripped from start to finish.I'm not usually a fan of violent films,but compared to some of the truly big budget British gangster films made recently this is certainly the best.The direction was fast,underlined by an exciting musical sore. The acting was excellent especially Freddie Connor,whom I found mesmerising.I'm sure we will see a lot of him in the future. 
tt1390397; I really enjoyed this. It's the sort of film that puts you right into the lives of the characters very quickly, and keeps you down there in amongst the filth and the brutality the whole way through.Some of the dialogue was a little clunky, but the production value was spot on and the story itself moved at a great pace. It also had some top notch British acting talent in the cast which doesn't hurt for this sort of thing. Dexter Fletcher and Jamie Foreman were along for the ride and were brilliant as always doing their (tried and tested) gangster thing.In terms of originality, the film isn't going to blow any minds, but as for a good old fashioned yarn about a man struggling with a life spiraling out of control it ticks all the boxes. Well worth a look... 
tt1390397; This movie had me hooked from start to finish, the whole flow of the movie was tight, the characters were believable. The violent scenes were well choreographed and believable. This film is not your stereotypical gangster movie as it is not about people who think they are gangsters, the movie brings to light the underbelly of the London night life.Although the film had a limited budget it is not your typical B movie as all the characters are strong and believable as stated. I would definitely recommend this movie to people if you enjoy action, grit and gangsters then this is worth a watch, as I was not disappointed with it at all. 
tt1390397; I loved this movie. I loved that it was NOT over the top Hollywood. I hate it when gangster movies are so over the top. They should be more about the inner working and dynamics and less about big explosions and shoot'em ups. I thought for sure that the car was going to flip up and be this huge explosion, but it wasn't which was great. There is no way people get away with blowing a car ski high and causing a scene. Also the beating the main character took at the end, hurt me. I loved hating the bad guys too. My friends and I want to see another Baseline where the character Joe takes over. He was excellent. This movie hit all the right spots for a person looking for realistic and believable gangster story. More gangster movies should be shot like this, less glam more grit. Well done to the writers and actors. 
tt1390397; I never managed to see this film at the cinema as it had a very limited release, but I picked up a copy on Blu Ray yesterday and was not disappointed. The quality of the picture and sound was exceptional.Firstly this is not your typical 'Gangster Movie', it's not about a wannabee gangster trying to ascend the ranks to win favour and to be the next top crime boss, it's a film about an average guy who works as a club bouncer, and who through no fault of his own is drawn into a dark world which he really does'nt want to be part of.It's the kind of film you could have seen Gary Oldman acting in a few years back, or if it had been based on a true story, Ken Loach directing. At no point does it have the typical "Cockney" Gangster characture. The film has a very realistic and gritty feel about it,from the opening title sequence to the very end. It does not glamorise gangsters and their life style in any way. The film plays heavily on loyalty, and what somebody is willing to sacrifice for friendship. The film moves along at a swift pace and has a really nice haunting score.There are a few scenes which are quite violent but are very believable, the realism is a credit to the film.The performances were very solid from all the cast, a few familiar faces cropped up which was nice to see, Dexter Fletcher, Jamie Forman Gemma Atkinson and Zoe Tapper. Both the Lead Actors gave very strong performances throughout the film as did all the supporting cast.The only negative thing that I can say about the movie is the explosion at the end could have been bigger, but as there is no commentary on the DVD I can only guess that they had limited funds and they only had one go at it.I would highly recommend this small independent film with its attribute to honour, friendship and loyalty. If you buy or rent this movie, do not expect a Mockney Gangster Film. 
tt1390397; Wasted my time with this film tonight, all of the acting was superb with the exception of the main character. Yes, obviously that ruins the whole movie because not only does he never really feel believable, the writer doesn't ever throw you a bone to make up for it -_- The Director and film crew along with a pretty good cast give you enough hope to keep watching, wishing and hoping the main character will get it together.... The A/v crew did a great job because it looks like with a low budget they managed to pull of a pretty great production visually. I hope this movie gets redone at some point with a bit of comedy and a better lead role though. 
tt1390397; this film is excellent, the performance from (Danny) Freddie Connor was brilliant as were the amazing (Terry) Jamie Foreman, the story was not what i expected. Danny works on the door of a brilliant grime club in the centre of east London helping to sort out trouble inside and outside the club..terry the manager almost gets shot one night and Danny saves him..(bad mistake for Danny) as this is where he is dragged into the underworld of crime which he really does not want. Danny then meets the beautiful (Jessica) Zoe Tapper and then proceeds to fall in love.. Danny decides he wants his own club with no trouble but is stuck between terry and Jessica.. the rest all falls into place with a fantastic story line great acting and an overall brilliant film.. 
tt1390397; Baseline (based upon another movie called The Grind) is an engaging, big budget gangster film with some romance thrown in that unfortunately just falls apart at the end. Let's just say it. The ending involves a car explosion that looks like Mickey Mouse pulled it off. Oh, come on, a briefcase full of plastic explosives and there is nothing but a few flames popping out of the window? And if our hero had the capability and know-how to pull something like that off, why didn't he do it long before things got as ugly as they did? Wouldn't a good shoot out have been more realistic and entertaining? It's also simply implausible that our hero has worked for this evil villain for three years but no trust or repertoire has developed. The big boss treats our hero like he is nothing but a worm and our hero takes it and takes it until the unbelievable ending, which of course involves our hero somehow magically freeing himself from the torture ropes to suddenly save the day. The first three fourths of this movie is excellent and this would have been a major blockbuster if the last one fourth didn't, well, how should I put it, suck. 
tt1390397; this film is excellent! The acting from (Danny) Freddie Connor was fantastic, how have I never seen this guy in other films??? (Terry) Jamie Foreman, bang on as always! Love this guy, always plays the nut's bosses in films. Really liked the the story too, was something different than what's out there already. Was not what I expected. Loved Dexter Fletcher in this, he's a proper actor too! Hats off to the film makers for getting Gemma Atkinson in there too, she should have been in it more though as she's proper hot! Didn't like the way Danny killed off Terry though, he should have had the balls to walk in to The Baseline and shoot him and his boys in the head like Tome Cruse does in Collateral.love that movie too! Still was a top UK film and me and the boys loved it! Is there gonna be a Baseline 2? 
tt1390397; A NEW DECADE.....AND A NEW ERA FOR BRITSH GANGSTER FILMS AND THE BASELINE HAS SET THE HIGH STANDARD!!! wow its been too long sense we've had a great original British gangster movie and when i saw it in the cinema i was blown away literally!!! its a great start to the decade and i think its deffently set a high standard for gangster films to come. and one major fact was i thought that the main actor Freddie Connor who played Danny the main character was fantastic as that part i'm surprised we haven't seen him sooner trust me hes gonna be a British gangster film legend. this is only the beginning. plus the supporting actors are just brilliant in their own right. Jamie Forman, Gorden Alexanda, Dexter Flecher and co are amazing. Zoe Tapper is outstanding as Danny's love interest for the film. the soundtrack as well is ear candy so all in all a real treat for British cinema and i hope that THE BASELINE is the start of Freddie Connor booming Career as and actor. so 10/10 a must see film 
tt0168899;  For reasons that are beyond me, French cinema seems to come with movies about such controversial subjects quite often (although they also produce more "mainstream" movies, believe me). If you are willing to watch a movie dealing with love, sex, AIDS and death and where the limits between good and evil are systematically blurred, this one does quite a clever job. If not, you have been warned.P.S: Don't believe all this is normal behaviour in France... 
tt0168899;  This film deals with themes that are some kind of taboo for some people, but at the end I thought it was just another film dealing with people and their fear of life. It is a film that tries to represent how life works for someone who doesnÂ´t care for it.This might sound interesting, in a way it is, the pace the music makes along with the blue tone of the environment, makes it a peculiar expression of life at the edge. Ben a man who hates his own life is capable to give and save the life of others. A cynical but disturbing fact.By the end I left the theater wondering whatÂ´ve I just saw, I canÂ´t say that I loved it, but certainly didnÂ´t hate it.  
tt0168899;  The picture is about using sexual deviation to cure tedium.  Here is a group of people who are living boring lives so they are experimenting with sexual variation to give them a quick fix.  This creates more impairment to these discontented people and as such the results are they become even more miserable.  The end result is you get to share a "slice of life" with unhappy people having meaningless deviant sexual encounters with other unhappy people while looking for some substance in there lives.  If this doesn't sound like a wonderful way to spend the evening, then I also agree.The central character works in a morgue and some of his coworkers exchange girl friends/wives, watch home made pornography and contribute to the debasement of the women who love them.  They spend the time in-between yelling at each other and feeling sorry for how miserable their lives are. The only time there is any warmth in the movie is when they are visiting their friend who is dying of AIDS.  This subplot is suppose to give us some reference about life and death but it is overshadowed by the selfish behavior of the leading roles.  Besides the main character who has three women who care for him and he treats them all with disdain there is a suicidal man and a lady who had died recently of a drug overdose but managed to come back to life.  The main character introduced the other two into his world of S&M, general depravity but mostly humiliation.  They seen to get along fine, as they are as screwed up as he is.  The man keeps a book of all his sexual encounters as this is the meaning for his life and the girl is just a bored youth living on ecstasy and techno music.  This movie is not about sexual obsession like Damage, Turkish Delight or even Last Tango in Paris it is about boredom, plain and not so simple.  The result left me not caring about the main character, not caring what these people do and only feeling sorry for the female roles that are played with some feeling and sensitivity but not enough to save this movie from being lackluster and unmoving.  
tt0168899; I generally like French films. I do recall that I liked Harrison's Flowers, which was also written by Didier Le PAacheur. This one, not so much.Maybe you think it is going somewhere despite the fact that Ben works in a morgue, and has the usual aberrant sexual habit that one would associate with that environment. TA©rA©sa comes in OD'd, nice looking, and you just figure Ben is going to do something. he comes out screaming with his pants down and you know what happened.OK, his wife has had it. She puts up with his sadomasochism and orgies, but this is just over the top. But, hey, TA©rA©sa hangs around. What's up with that, girl? Ben is just letting people float by him like corpses. His life is just a mess, and he's so freaking depressed that he bums me out! I just couldn't handle it. The guy has not heart. You know that thing above your cock and to the left. Nothing there. Depressing. Never gets any better. Bummer. 
tt0168899;  I recently saw this film at the Second Annual NY S/M Film Festival.The movie wrestles such topics as alternative sexuality, AIDS and death.  Unfortunately, it wrestles these topics as only the French can do... Pretentious and boring. Even the scene in a French Leather Club just boggled my mind in how unrealistic it was.  Everyone in this film seemed to be suffering from some major mental and emotional breakdown, and frankly, it was just a very depressing movie to watch. 
tt0168899; sex, death and immorality. That is, about the truth. So beautiful to me for these very reasons. Become an atheist (tip: read Karl Marx) and then watch this. Karl Marx said was a materialist. That means that, according to he and other materialists (not the Madonna type, exactly), what you perceive with your senses corresponds to something outside your mind, to matter. Not everyone believes/believed that. Some think that it's all in your head, that your sensations are just that, that there is no physical world that you are perceiving through your senses. They are called idealists. Some idealist believed your perceptions are beamed into your head by God, or that everything is thought... And some are not sure and play it safe. They are agnostics. Which is just Greek for "I'm clueless." If you say I'm a materialist then you take a physical world for granted, you trust your senses and you live according to the world you perceive. Marx started there and also said, gods and philosophy and tastes and governmental forms are just results of the pattern of fundamental human interaction: how we eat (by working in the fields? by barter? in a factory?), which determines social hierarchy, which determines our hopes and aspiration and self-image, which determines religion and what is presented as "absolute truth," be it the best form of government or the best art or... SO...if you like that...and you find yourself an atheist...you find yourself FREE. And no longer hide truths by censoring yourself with the "thou shalt not"s you have learned and never questioned. And then also, perhaps, life can become very bare bones, vivid, brutal. And then this film shows the bones so beautifully. 
tt0087945; The beginning is awful: trying to convince us that we are on an alien planet, Fred Olen Ray shoots everything through a red filter - it worked in "The Angry Red Planet", it's a pain on the eyes here. But soon enough the action moves in the Prison Ship of the title, and the film turns into a cross between sci-fi and WIP - and furthermore, the kind of WIP I like: less focus on torture and humiliation, more on catfights (there are 2, both very good) and the final escape. The special effects are enjoyably cheesy, though I, for one, would prefer to see as a climax a hand-to-hand fight between the heroine and the female warden instead of the laser space battles we do get (some of them apparently lifted from other sources). The girls are pretty sexy and put a lot of spirit and energy into their roles, especially Sandy Brooke who should have had a longer B-movie career. (**1/2) 
tt0087945; i don't care what critics say about Fred Olen ray,he makes fun movies. prison ship is very campy and fun sort of like the flash Gordon serials. i love the opening music for the credits.it sounds similar to the raiders of the lost ark theme.anyway its a science fiction women in prison flick.with some of my favorite actors,Aldo Rey,Bobbie bresee, ross hagen,dawn wildsmith,and even johnny legend.some of the space battle scenes were stock footage from battle beyond the stars.its not star wars but its still a fun movie to watch.i believe this was inspired by flash Gordon and buck rogers.i wish i could find this on DVD i rented this from a video store about 10 years ago on ancient VHS. but i think it would be far much better in widescreen.all i can say is Fred Olen ray keep making them fun movies,ignore the movie critics,they are sheep.i know this is crazy but i give prison ship 8 out of 10. 
tt0087945;  This is a cheesy,low budget late 80's piece of crap. The opening score is a direct rip-off from Raiders/Lost Ark but changes every few notes so as not to be sued. Awful acting, some good gore, always threats of lesbianism but nothing to show for it, some strange costumes and "little people" running around with awful speeded-up voices. A mess, but my friends and I love to get together and watch "bad" movies and we really hooted and hollered at most of this. It's No Star Crash or Space Mutiny (true low budget cheese sci-fi disaster classics) but it has some fun moments.  
tt0087945; As a fan of Fred Olen Ray films i have to say prison ship is quite entertaining.i know it has a shoestring budget.John Carridine in one of his next to last films as a space magistrate who sends a beautiful sexy fiery blonde babe(Sandy Brooke)to a prison ship full of babes.run by a busty tough warden played by Marya Gant,and her sadistic one eyed trustee played by Dawn Wildsmith(a olen ray regular)of course there's a twisted sadistic lunatic(Ross Hagen)who wants revenge.because he lost his hand in a fight with the heroine.also on hand is Johnny Legend as a space rabbi,the great Aldo Ray as the a master of torture,and cameo by the beautiful Bobbie Bresee.there's aliens robots,Jagger rats(don't ask)and a space battle lifted from Roger Cormans,battle beyond the stars.and a good opening score that sounds like raiders of the lost ark.granted i saw this movie on ancient VHS so the picture quality is not very good.some critics will think I'm crazy for liking this and giving it 7 out of 10,but remember the critics Siskell and Ebert admitting they enjoyed,invasion of the bee girls and infra man.I'm hoping to see prison ship on a good quality DVD.prison ship is a killer-b movie,i found it enjoyable. 
tt0087945;  There is a leech-eating scene.... need I say more?  At one point, during the requisite prison cafeteria food-fight scene, several of the actresses literally crack up and start giggling during their lines.One of the actresses, a doctor, was actually not half bad (in comparison), and I felt very sad for her, the rest of the actresses didn't seem to take the script seriously at all, and who can blame them?  They were probably coeds promised free beer if they showed up and read from cue cards.This movie is so very bad that it's actually hysterically funny. 
tt0087945; SEE. . . John Carradine, in a cameo even more pointless than the one from ICE PIRATES. SEE. . . footage from DARK STAR and BATTLE BEYOND THE STARS repetitively incorporated into the proceedings. And DON'T see any T&A, beyond the lovely Ms. Brooke's two (just two?) topless shots. Yep, it's a 'women-in-prison' flick, in space no less, that doesn't work in the communal shower, or the kinky pecking order, or any degrading 'initiation' rites. What a shame. What a shame indeed.At least Ross Hagen's in it, wearing Jared-Syn's old body armor. And I got a kick out of the 'episode' titles... a junky below-B-movie that gives its self dramatic structure, now how often do you see that? About as often as promised but undelivered sequels, which is to say often enough."See the continuing adventures of Taura in- CHAIN GANG PLANET!"Or not. 
tt0087945;  OK. So the line above is kinda silly, but so is this film.Fred Olen ray is a master at spending no money, and somehow always having a film to show for it. Granted, most of his films end up being very static due to lack of monies for alternate takes and complex editing.OK. So Ray isn't what you'd call Speilberg. His films concentrate on borrowed sets and costumes(this one's got them), has-been actors( Sid Haig, John Carradine, Aldo Ray, ect.), and some of the most stiff and lifeless dialogue this side of Ray Dennis Steckler.PRISON SHIP( I saw this as STAR SLAMMER) is a piece of junk, filled with borrowed effects from BATTLESTAR GALLACTICA and BUCK RODGERS. There is some skin, but not enough. Mostly, there is talk, and as many a reviewer likes to point out, Fred Olen Ray makes very chatty pictures. That's because he either doesn't have the creativity, or the perspective, to realize that you don't need a ton of money to make a good film. You just need talent.Why should I continue? PRISON SHIP is cheesy, and painful. Don't watch this unless you must see every film that John Carradine is in (or you really like train wrecks). 
tt0087945; Although I enjoy watching drive-in style movies, I have to confess that there is a genre in this genre I have never particularly enjoyed, and that is the women-in-prison genre. I like the *sound* of what the genre promises to offer, but I have always found the actual execution to be dull and boring. And all of these movies seem the same after a while. When I heard about PRISON SHIP (better known as STAR SLAMMER), I was intrigued. A women-in-prison movie taking place in the future, and in space? I decided to give it a chance.The fact that Fred Olen Ray directed this movie should have warned me. In fairness, not everything in the movie is bad. The sets and spaceship models, while definitely low budget, are not as bad to the eye as you may think. There is the occasional in-joke that made me smile (a planet is called "Arous", there's an alien that looks like one of the aliens from the movie THE DEADLY SPAWN). And there are a few unintentional laughs, like when the musical score sounds very much like the musical score for RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK.Aside from those bright moments, I found the movie tough to sit through. It's incredibly slow-moving - there is simply no plot advance for long stretches of time. The female heroine is poorly sketched, with a lot of the focus surprisingly not on her. And while you may expect the movie to be sleazy, it feels more like a PG-rated movie - there's almost no nudity, no real sex, and light violence.Thank goodness they didn't make the sequel that's announced at the end of the movie. 
tt0087945; The space fighting scenes are right out of Roger Cormens classic "Battle Beyond the Stars". (Like cut and paste out of it that is)Then for those of us who actually survive this epic to the end and make it to the credits, we seem to be misled, because at the beginning of the credits we are told to look for the next adventure of Tara in "Chain Gang Planet". What happened??? I realize this movie is bad, but hey, just for a good laugh I would pick up the next one on DVD. If you are a serious sci-fi fan, you might be better off to look to something else for your collection. If you are into low budget c-movies (I don't think of this as even a B movie) and are looking for a good laugh then look no further. 
tt0087945;  I saw this film when I was a student back in 1988 or 1989. A friend and I hired it on video.It has got to be one of the most dire films I have ever seen.  Totally derivative, unoriginal, cheap, tacky, badly acted, buttock-clenchingly bad.The special effects for the space battles are lifted directly from Battle Beyond The Stars. Strangely enough, I've seen another film that has done this, so maybe the makers of BBTS sold the rights to that footage to make some money.Bearing in mind that I am writing this review 11 years after seeing the film, I'd give it a huge thumbs down at 1/10. 
tt0046057; A woman and her aunt go to Scotland to locate her evasive fiancA©. This is a much-maligned film because of its denouement, but up to that point, it's interesting, well-acted, eerie, and with fine set design (by William Cameron Menzies, developed for 3-D projection). Veronica Hurst is captivating and genteel, sort of a chic British Marilyn Monroe, still in love with Richard Carlson, who is hiding a family secret in his forbidding castle, there are even bats in the belfry! It moves leisurely until the final extraordinary set-piece, when Hurst and her aunt (Katherine Emery, also the narrator), sneak out of the castle in the night to venture into the maze and find what they're looking for in its center. As a kid, I always remembered this sequence - there's nothing scarier (or claustrophobic) than not finding your way out of a 10-foot high maze of hedges. Naturally, the two women get separated, setting the stage for engrossing suspense with horrific music. The final result is mildly disappointing really, since Carlson's epilogue {a "Psycho" (1960) style postscript} makes some sense to all the goings-on, even provoking sympathy. Worth seeing. 
tt0046057; I remember this film of old. It's a great, chilling, atmospheric horror picture about a man who moves into a Scottish castle, only to discover that there are strange goings-on in the corridors at night. And there are even stranger events taking place out back, in Hollywood's most familiar hedge maze. Yes, this is the maze you've seen in every feature-length film that ever involved a topiary puzzle, up to and including "The Shining." But the punchline to this story is about the last thing you would guess. I certainly didn't see it coming. This is a fine example of how good and convincing a movie can be even when the premise is utterly loopy, bordering on laughable. I'd recommend it to anyone. 
tt0046057;  Is this a good movie?  It's hard to say -- but in 1953, for many people, it was a remarkably effective movie, suspenseful, scary and then, amazingly, actually touching when "the old gentleman" meets his unhappy death at the end of the movie.Yes, what lurks in the Maze turns out to be something of a surprise and, for a lot of people, a hilarious one.  But the basic idea (ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny) was a very real one at the time the book was written, and does have some basis in fact.  Not that it would ever result in what we see in the movie, of course.But working on what must have been a very low budget, one of the greatest production designers -- and the person for whom the term "production designer" was invented -- creates a very eerie mood that was strangely compelling.  At times, of course, the movie is very silly, but it has its moments.  
tt0046057;  The basic premise of this film with its spooky old castle and an aristocratic family with a skeleton in the closet was a popular theme of films in 30's and 40's (THE OLD DARK HOUSE, AMONG THE LIVING,and THE UNKNOWN are a few examples.) The basic plot was probably considered old fashioned or at best "quaint" by the 1950's when this film was made. I agree with those who suspect that because Maurice Sandoz novel on which this film was based contained a bizarre science fiction twist, this film was made. Instead of an insane twin or assumed dead relative hiding from the law for some unspeakable crime, we have a phylogenetic freak! I think to like this film one must have a taste for offbeat fantasy. If viewed in  the right frame of mind and one is willing to suspend their dis-belief, this can be a very enjoyable film. That being said, this film has many faults. The most obvious being that of the often intrusive narration by the "Aunt." Richard Carlson tries hard, but his performance is not up to snuff. Then there is the "frog." In most scenes it is shown only in the shadows and in brief glimpses its okay, but at the end when it goes (no pun intended) hopping mad and jumps out the window it looks silly. While this sequence I'm told by those who have seen this film on the big screen in 3D is rather startling, shown flat or on T.V. is laughable. The "frog" looks like a bad rubbery prop. However even with todays high tech special effects, I don't think a giant frog could be made to look scary now matter how hard anyone tried. While "the maze" of the title is interesting and give indications of Menzies design genius, most of the castle consists standing sets left over sets from previous films. A SIDE NOTE: The science fictional premise of this film is based on the theory of phylogeny. That is that the human embryo goes through stages just like in evolution, a fish, then an amphibian, then a reptile, then a mammal. Sir Roger, the man with body of frog and the mind of a man, stopped developing at the amphibian stage. However according to the theory, the embryo resembles a neotenic salamander and not a frog. May I also add that this theory taught as written in stone in all biology textbooks, has been mostly discredited in recent years.  
tt0046057;  I recently saw this film at a 3-D film festival in Hollywood. It was in polarized 3-D (Gray glasses not red & blue) It was so much fun to watch this film with an audience, the print was excellent and the 3-D perfect. The performances were over the top and that added to the fun, the surprise ending (that we aren't supposed to share with fellow movie go'ers, at least according to the movie trailer and poster) had people howling with laughter. By today's standards this is probably more comedy than horror but with the added dimension of 3-D (complete with cobwebs and bats coming out of the screen) this film was an entertaining romp into 50's horror. 
tt0046057; For most of its running time, "The Maze" is a nicely made chiller if a bit average. Its well directed by William Cameron Menzies (who also made the cult classic "Invaders From Mars" and worked on "The Thief of Baghdad"), who creates a brooding and chilling Gothic atmosphere. There's no shortage of horror stories set in old castles, and while this film doesn't add anything new to the setting, it manages to use the familiar location quite well. The screenplay is often very somber, and the performance by Richard Carlson in the lead is quite accomplished. Veronica Hurst is a bit less successful and rather over-the-top, but the relationship between the characters is surprisingly developed, so its easy to overlook the shortcomings on her behalf.The film is a somber and moody Gothic chiller up until the climax. I won't ruin it for you, but simply put its one of the most absolutely ludicrous things ever in a film and threatens to ruin the film. The film was quite involving and than it completely spins around and presents one of the most unintentionally hilarious conclusions ever. Its really a shame, because the writers obviously put some thought into it, and it had the potential to be a tragic conclusion. Oh well, "The Maze" is still a decent enough drive-in horror flick. (5/10) 
tt0046057; Gerald (Richard Carlson) and Kitty (Veronica Hurst) have just finished celebrating their engagement announcement in France with family and friends, when he receives a letter asking him to visit an ancestral castle located in Scotland. Gerald's uncle reportedly has fallen ill and has requested Gerald, the sole heir, be present. Gerald goes off to Scotland, leaving his future bride behind. A few weeks pass and he doesn't come back. Concerned, Kitty sends out telegrams but doesn't hear back from her fiancA©. Four more weeks pass and Kitty finally receives a weird response from Gerald, calling off the engagement and telling her to move on with her life. Not ready to give up on her relationship and looking for answers, Kitty hops on a plane and decides to pay Gerald a visit. Accompanying her on the trip is her level-headed aunt Edith (Katherine Emery, best known for her starring role in the classic chiller ISLE OF THE DEAD). When Kitty and Edith arrive at the MacTeam estate they immediately suspect something strange is afoot. For starters Gerald seems to have aged twenty-years in a matter of weeks. Secondly, this once nice and charming guy has turned into a complete jerk who repeatedly demands they leave the castle and never come back. When Edith comes down with a mild cold, Kitty uses it as an excuse to stay there to try to get to the bottom of things.Why is Gerald being so cold and cruel to the woman he was just about to marry? Why is Gerald so opposed to having company? Why do the house rules state that guests must be locked inside their bedrooms at night? Why are guests forbidden to enter certain areas of the estate, such as Gerald's bedroom and a large hedge maze out back? And what's making those strange dragging noises every night? These are just some of the questions THE MAZE poses. The movie actually does a fine job building up mystery and intrigue. You genuinely become interested in what's going on and patiently await the resolution to explain the weird events that are taking place. And then IT happens... I definitely don't want to ruin the finale of this film because you're better off not knowing, but it takes one of the most unbelievable and jaw-droppingly strange turns I've seen in any movie. It's wonderfully ludicrous in a way, but it also takes a pretty solid little b/w mystery and sends it straight into Z-Grade schlock territory. And yet, this ending seems so out of place, you're not likely to forget it once you see it.Despite the ending (or maybe even partially because of the ending), I really enjoyed this odd bird. It's extremely talky and slow moving for the duration of the run time, but it managed to keep my interest throughout. Director William Cameron Menzies (who made the much more famous INVADERS FROM MARS the same year) is best known as a two-time Oscar-winning art director and his set designs here are also really interesting. There's almost a silent movie feel at times, with model work for some of the exteriors, some painted backdrops and sparsely decorated interiors with very high ceilings. As with any good castle set there are also secret passageways and long staircases. This one also throws in a few rubber-bats-on-strings for good measure.A few of the actors are a little stiff and awkward, but I liked most of the cast. Hurst is one of those obscure and mostly unknown actresses who unfortunately never seemed to catch on despite being both beautiful and talented. Emery, who also gets to play narrator in framing shots at the beginning and end of the film, is decent enough as the overly mannered and cautious aunt. My favorite however was Michael Pate as the silver-haired sinister servant who does this hilariously upright zombie walk every time he ascends the stairs. Also on board in smaller roles are Hillary Brooke (who played the title role in the Sherlock Holmes mystery THE WOMAN IN GREEN) and Lilian Bond (Whale's THE OLD DARK HOUSE). Of course Carlson also starred in IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE, CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON and some other horror flicks, so you've got yourself a pretty decent cast for genre fans right there. I say check it out! 
tt0046057; The Maze (1953)** (out of 4) When her fiancA© Gerald (Richard Carlson) leaves before their wedding with no real answer, Kitty (Veronica Hurst) and her aunt (Katherine Emery) follow him to his family's estate in Scotland. Once there the women discover that Gerald has aged for some reason and soon they realize that there's even more family secrets. THE MAZE is a hard film to judge because it contains some very good stuff but the problem is that the story itself is just boring and really drawn out for no good reason. The film features some terrific performances as well as a haunting atmosphere and these here make it worth sitting through. Director William Cameron Menzies (INVADERS FROM MARS) does a wonderful job building up the creepy atmosphere of the old castle. From the opening shots of the fog thick outside to the staircase with all the spider webs. The director really makes one believe you're in this location and he also puts the maze (much like the one later seen in THE SHINING) to good use. He also handles the B&W cinematography very well as the film looks terrific and the use of shadows is well done. Carlson turns in a good performance in the lead and I though both Hurst and Emery were good. The supporting players are good as well so with all of this what's the problem? The screenplay is incredibly weak and it just doesn't go anywhere. Gerald asks the women to leave. They tell a lie to where they can stay an extra day. They discuss what could possibly be happened. These three steps repeat themselves over and over and it's just really boring. I won't give away the secret but when it's finally revealed you really can't help but laugh. The effect of this reveal is also rather laughable. The film was originally shot in 3-D but watching the standard version I really didn't see anything that would really jump out. THE MAZE is an interesting film with a lot going for it but sadly most of the good stuff was just wasted. 
tt0046057; "The Maze" is a lot of fun and a great example of a certain type of B-movie. It has remained firmly stuck in my mind for two reasons:First, the ending is just totally bizarre and out of left-field. Some of the other reviewers have mentioned it, but I don't really think that they have conveyed just out strange it is. I never saw it coming. It's also hilarious, though the movie plays the situation with a straight face.Second, once the movie ended (and it actually wraps up very quickly once the "solution" is presented), I could not help but start thinking about what had been said. For one thing, the Baronet describes the original master (who is basically a 203-year-old giant frog...seriously...not somebody with a frog-like face, but a real frog) as enjoying the chance to take off his cloak and swim in the pond. The whole frog with a cloak image still sticks in my mind. Then there's the question of how the frog manages to convey his wishes to the servants and his heirs, since he apparently runs the place. And why do the heirs all die at a relatively young age? The stress of caring for their great-great-great-grandfrog? Inquiring minds like mine want to know. In short, this film leave a lot of unanswered questions. Don't miss it. 
tt0046057; The next-in-line to a Scottish heirloom, which is shrouded in mystery, suddenly breaks off his engagement to an American girl, inevitably, but against the baronet's better judgment, she turns up at the forbidding estate to investigate. Distinguished production designer-turned-director William Cameron Menzies (much like his later British counterpart Robert Fuest)'s most notable efforts in the latter capacity were in the Fantasy genre: this is the fourth and least of them and would also prove to be the last theatrical feature he ever helmed. Actually, it is not that hard to see why, since what we have here is more folly than fable Â<U+0096> even if the film's overpowering atmosphere (filmed in 3-D) somehow renders the undeniably ludicrous plot compulsive. The cast (including Richard Carlson, Michael Pate and an unrecognizable Lillian Bond Â<U+0096> from 1932's THE OLD DARK HOUSE) is not insignificant, but they have fairly little of interest to do or say: the intruding castle visitors do nothing except prowl its sinister corridors aimlessly at night and feign illness the morning after to extend their stay there! There are a couple of intriguing incidents to be sure: the women finding troubled Carlson has gone grey-haired in a matter of months since they had last seen him and once chancing upon a mysterious nightly processionÂ but, clearly, the film-makers believe that the unique revelation at the end is enough of an ace up their sleeve to bother making anything of them when these occur!

tt0081032; No, this isn't a very good movie. Fun to watch though if for no other reason than to laugh at the supposed 'hip' attitude of the whole thing when in truth it's about as conventional as a Love Boat episode. The party scene at the end with the hookers, swingers and disco version of 'Singin' in the Rain' is hilarious.But the reason to see this movie is for Natalie Wood, who gives this film heart. She's absolutely wonderful in it. She was a terrific actress, even in something as frivolous as this ... funny, beautiful, a class act to the very end! None of today's actresses come close to her kind of star-power. I miss great actresses like Natalie Wood. 
tt0081032;  One of the most underrated movies of late seventies.Good direction by Gilbert Cates in a witty screenplay the players are excellent.The chemistry between Wood and Segal are a gift from heaven.The scenes between the main characters are touching.The supporting players are nice too specially Dom DeLuise and Marilyn Sokol.A movie to be discover. 
tt0081032; George Segal and Natalie Wood portray an upper-class married couple in Los Angeles who find they are the last of a dying breed: all the men and women within their circle of friends are separated from their spouses, divorced, or on the make. Occasionally smart and amusing screenplay by John Herman Shaner doesn't take a righteous stand on the sexy goings-on, though Shaner is quick to point out the pitfalls of the swinging middle-ager (impotency, venereal disease, unfulfilled coupling). Gilbert Cates directs it like an R-rated TV show, though some of the intended bite (laced with grown-up, witty humor) manages to come through, and the cast is good--however less of hammy Dom DeLuise would have been an improvement. Wood, in particular, shows a great deal of growth since her not-dissimilar dalliance with sexual inhibitions in 1969's "Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice", she's surprisingly loose and physical here, and works comfortably with Segal, though George himself is rather wrung-out. With the sexual revolution of the 1970s fading fast upon its release, the film didn't stand a chance at the box-office, but parts of it are very funny and trenchant and have held up well. ** from **** 
tt0081032; Jeff (George Segal) and Mari (Natalie Wood) Thompson are a happily married couple...but all the other married couples they know are divorced or separated and seem happy being single. It leads them to start questioning their own marriage and if they really are happy.I only caught this for Natalie Wood. This film was not a success (I remember it bombed badly back in 1980) and it was Wood's second to last theatrical film. It's not as bad as I've heard but no great movie either. It has a LOT of sex talk and jokes and bed hopping (this was pre-AIDS) but surprisingly no nudity till the very end. In fact, it plays a lot like an R rated sitcom. The script actually isn't bad--it perfectly captures the late 1970s styles, language and attitude towards sex and marriage. But, it cops out at the end and becomes VERY conventional. Pretty typical for a Hollywood sex comedy. The cast is very attractive--Segal overacts but in an endearing way, Wood is just great and looks fantastic (it's surprising to hear her swear!} and Valerie Harper is excellent as a sexually liberated woman. The biggest problem here is that it's never really funny. It's only mildly amusing at best. Still if you're interested in the 1970s and their view of sex you'll probably like this. I give it a 5. 
tt0081032; See "The Last Married Couple in America" with "Serial" (released around the same time...) and you get a good idea of what ideas were floating around during the late 70s and early 80s.Though both films are not very good and they are horribly dated (in a fun way) they reflect a post 60s hangover attitude that's interesting in light of what occurred in 1980 with the election of Ronald Reagan.Many thought that the 60s was going to usher in a whole new perspective and enlightenment to the masses. The use of drugs and free love was supposed to push all people's barriers down and out and a new world was to be created. Most people may not have completely shared in that feeling but there was a strong feeling of new and better things were going to happen.But of course it didn't. People were burned out in the 70s and reality settled in: drugs, free love...it didn't change much at all. And in some cases, it made things worse by making it all so confusing. People who thought that the 60s were going to make everything better were disillusioned to find that nothing fundamental had really changed at all.That's where "The Last Married Couple in America" and "Serial" take their cues. Both movies start off by trying to be "risky", "edgy" and "daring" by using a lot of four letter words and pseudo-risquA© sex scenes (all pretty conventional, actually). The jokes are just sitcom material spiced up with "naughty" words.In the end, both movies end with a very comfortable reaffirmation of the family/marriage unit and a rejection of the sexual revolution.OK...so there might be some ripe material made out of this. But neither of these two is it, especially "The Last Married Couple in America". It's another one of those lame 70s comedies like "Silver Bears" with Cybil Shepherd. These are the types of films that even when they were released, I couldn't figure out who would pay money to see them. 
tt0081032; This film isn't very good but it's a semi-interesting reflection of the way social mores were changing by the end of the Seventies.George Segal is OK as Jeff, a purportedly happily married man who isn't above sleeping with seductive women and lying to his wife when he gives her an STD. Natalie Wood, never more beautiful and only a year away from her tragic drowning, is the best thing about the film, playing Jeff's wife, Mari, who may be trying to become more assertive but also believes in old-fashioned marital fidelity.This film is full of off-color one-liners and caricatured supporting characters, from Valerie Harper as a divorcA©e with a surgically enhanced vagina and Richard Benjamin as an overly neurotic doomsayer to Bob Dishy as a sex-obsessed lawyer and Dom DeLuise's serially marrying buffoon. This movie came out before the proliferation of computers and it's striking to see couples not consulting their mobile devices but rather tossing around a football and roller skating for fun. It's not just marriage mores that have changed radically...The film features a couple of wonderfully atmospheric songs sung by Maureen McGovern.In all, a diverting but likely unmemorable period piece. 
tt0081032; This movie is so bad it's jaw-dropping. How did Natalie Wood and George Segal agree to be in this mess? Maybe she thought it would be critically acclaimed like Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice - her earlier film about bored upper-class marrieds. No one in the entire film acts remotely like a real human being. Valerie Harper in an unflattering blonde hairdo tries way too hard to be sexy, Bob Dishy, Marilyn Sokol, Dick Benjamin and Alan Arbus play embarrassing roles requiring them to complain non-stop about their sex lives, and Dom Delouise does a bizarre sleazy dance with his hooker-wife! However on the positive side, because it's SOOO bad, it's actually entertaining. Check out the BAD perms on almost everyone - male and female. And how often do you see a star like Natalie Wood say ass****, the f-word, watch a young woman strip naked, AND complain about her period all in the same movie?! 
tt0081032;  "The Last Married Couple In America" is a misfire, and a waste of a perfectly good cast. In fact, the great chemistry between George Segal and Natalie Wood is the only thing that forces me to give this movie a ** rating, instead of the more appropriate *1/2. But to be a movie exclusively about marriage and not to be able to present even one meaningful insight into the subject in more than 100 minutes is quite a feat, indeed! 
tt0263939; I was lucky enough to catch this film at a film festival in Miami. The film is about Pedro Rey who preceded Pablo Escobar as Colombi's main cocaine kingpin in the 1970's. The film is a Colombian production and filmed on location in Cali. While the film is low budget it is very rich in character development and story.The film pretty much tells the story of how Pedro Rey rose from his humble beginnings to be one of the top cocaine dealers in Colombia. Along the way he befriends an American from the Peace Corps who becomes his main distribution contact in the U.S. The film exposes how the drug money Pedro Rey earns can corrupt politicians, police forces and his own family. The movie was well acted and the characters very real. The film did remind me of Brian De Palma's "Scarface" but overall it was a good production. 
tt0263939; "El Rey" tells the story of a "cocaine king" in Colombia in a time before Pablo Escobar (from the 60s to the middle 70s). This film has a taste of truth. It doesn't try to judge and describes the times and life of Pedro "El Rey". It shows how the cocaine traffic was in agreement with Colombian society at the time with the growing American involvement in Colombia. The film describes "el Rey" starting as a bar owner paying the rent for his business establishment, trying to find outlets to grow in his activity and becoming eventually the cocaine king in Colombia. As I've already said "El Rey" (unlike many American films) doesn't pass judgement, and there are no car chases, great shootouts or many other things so dear to the American movies. There's no tear-stained moralism or preaching. "El Rey" is able to simply tell a story which shows the life of a big cocaine trafficker, his connection to the time, and his hopes, loves, and dreams. This is a film that portrays human beings with their contradictions. It entertains and is able to open ours eyes to a reality many of us know only superficially. 
tt0263939; I saw this movie with family in south America a few years ago and it was a fairly big hit, in Latin America it got good reviews and did well, but in the United States it pretty much never made it(which happens with a lot of foreign films). To me it was like Scarface with more substance. I'm into the genre of crime films, but find myself bored by the recycled plots. This movie is made in Colombia about a real Colombia drug kingpin and its excellent. Its available on Netflix, because obviously blockbuster wouldn't carry a movie like this, and its well worth it. It is not a high budget action movie like we're use to, its more of a crime drama set in the world of drugs that has a very authentic feel to it since its all filmed on located in Cali, Colombia. 
tt0263939; The distinction of "El Rey" is in the details of telling the story realistically. The actual plot is a standard one for gangster movies, although Rey is not a gangster but a businessman. In gangster movies, what happens typically is that a man rises to head a big enterprise, has a period of high success and high living, but then falls to a bad end because of personal weaknesses that tie into rivals, women, drugs, etc.Solarzano is the king, and we see a faithful account of the period and place in Colombia when cocaine became a product in demand in America and other countries. Solarzano is a businessman who sees an opportunity and seizes it. He is able to find police who will look the other way. He is able to get the raw material through an associate, Marlon Moreno. Moreno used to be the lover of the woman that Solarzano marries, Christina Umana, and that rivalry never dies out. It burns brighter when Solarzano takes a mistress, Vanessa Simon, and neglects Moreno while she takes to cocaine.Solarzano uses a peace corps worker (Olivier Pages) to distribute the refined product in North America. Further rivalry ensues when he attempts to cut out the middleman and find buyers himself in Mexico. Moreno also is separately competing and using Pages himself for some product. As in "Scarface" (1983), the use of drugs, the large amounts of money being made, sex appetites and success undermine the head man. Business problems arise due to bad judgments and bad management.There are no concocted chases or violence in this movie. What there is of violence comes naturally. It's something that Solarzano finds necessary because the business is illegal. His passions are what help him build the business, and they also contribute to his fall. At first he doesn't use drugs, but he goes off eventually on cocaine and that is the main thing that brings him down.It's very good to see such a movie coming out of Colombia, to see film making of this caliber going on there. This was evidently a difficult project. The film has a lot of energy and movement, while showing the human side of the cocaine business at its inception and before really violent people got into it and cartels formed. 
tt0263939; The movie tells about the drug smuggling Pioneer "Pedro Rey". He was the person who preceded Pablo Escobar as Colombia's main cocaine dealer in the early 1970's. The movie is produced and filmed in Cali (Colombia).The movie mainly tells how Pedro Rey became the most famous cocaine dealer in Colombia and how he made it possible to handle in overseas drugs dealing.The film exposes how the drug money can corrupt politicians, police forces and his own family. The movie was well acted and the characters very real.Personally I found it a great movie, because it had a great truth level.Bruno

tt0097555;  This is an absurd film, and in my book, that's a big compliment. It gives us a glimpse into the colourful world of Elsie and Joey Wellman. She's an ingA©nue from Ohio who emigrates to Paris to pursue Culture, which she found sadly lacking in the home of Joey, her exuberant cartoonist father. In "On connaA®t la chanson", it was songs Resnais used to show what was going on in his characters' minds, here, how could it be anything but cartoons? Though they haven't talked in two years, Joey's cartoon cat keeps intruding into Elsie's thoughts in a black-and-white bubble, usually scolding her. And a cutely vitriolic little cat it is! When Joey decides to visit Elsie on pretext of a cartoon exhibit, a major crisis threatens...Resnais, who has worked with the likes of Enki Bilal (in "La vie est un roman"), obviously loves cartoons and cartoonists, yet also sympathizes with pretty over-intellectual young women like Elsie (a predecessor of Camille in "On connaA®t la chanson"). Many of his later movies use inspiredly silly elements to treat serious problems. Watching this one, I wondered about his influence on people like Hal Hartley. Strongly recommended to film-lovers, but probably not to the average movie-goer. 
tt0097555; Before shooting "I want to go home", if Resnais had thought of keeping somebody in mind, it is quite possible that he must have had ruminated about both American and French public. "I want to go home" shows why French fascinate Americans so much. It is a fairly honest portrayal of why French have all the respect for Americans. It is so hard to believe that this comic film was made by Resnais. For the last five decades, he has remained a highly intelligent intellectual cinA©aste who has excelled in making difficult films about memories. Watching his films can be likened to a concentrated reading of a "stream of consciousness" oeuvre. Not only will this film charm die-hard francophiles like Paul Auster, Johnny Depp, William Fiedkin, Jim Jarmusch, Hal Hartley and John Malkovich but also fans of comic strips as it is not so often that one comes across a feature film in which there is a happy marriage of cartoons and film. Through this quirky work, Resnais has advocated popular culture as in today's world Mickey Mouse, Snoopy, Charlie Brown and Garfield are as relevant/necessary and useful for everybody as Flaubert, Stendhal and Sartre. "I want to go home" is a light film which provides a multiplicity of meanings for its viewers. On an elementary level it explores cultural differences between French and American people. On another level it is also a tale of an amicable reconciliation process which happens between a father meeting his daughter after many years. This emotional turmoil has been shown in a very dignified indeed subtle manner. Although it might seem odd, this film makes it absolutely clear that French have a penchant for admiring those American artists who have been ignominiously rejected/ignored back home in USA. One classical example is Samuel Fuller. He enjoys a bigger, dedicated fan following in France than in United States of America. "I want to go home" is a film which can be understood by all kinds of artists. It speaks of different arts like cinema, comics etc. This is why Resnais has collaborated with great artists like Enki Bilal, Jules Feiffer and John Kander. The highlight of this film is the fact that it shows how all arts are interrelated as well as mutually beneficial. In "I want to go home" the characters alternate between serious mood and comic mood. This is because people can't always remain funny or serious. Resnais makes us all imbibe a logical lesson that in our daily lives we have to react according to the situation in which we find ourselves. Lastly it is high time that it is said that although Americans might abhor French or vice versa, the truth is that both of them cannot live without each other. 
tt0097555; One of Alain Resnais' more mainstream films, including American actors and characters in a mostly English language script. It is deservedly forgotten. Quite frankly, it's garbage. Adolph Green (of the musical team Comden and Green, who worked on Singin' in the Rain and The Bandwagon) plays a curmudgeonly Cleveland comic strip writer who is invited to Paris for a gallery show on American comics. He hopes to finally see his daughter (Laura Benson), who hasn't spoken to him in the two years she's been going to college there. Benson finds her father lowbrow, though, and ditches him, hoping she can finally catch up to her professor (Gerard Depardieu). Unbeknownst to her, Depardieu is secretly a huge fan of American comic strips, and ends up inviting Green and his girlfriend (Linda Lavin) to stay with him at his mother's country estate. Benson, when she finds out, decides to follow them. The problems with this movie are many, but the worst one is that Green is an enormous, enormous jerk. He spends the whole film yelling at everybody, frequently complaining at as loud a volume possible about how horrible the French are. You know there's a problem when you want to bludgeon the main character of a movie to death within ten seconds of his first appearance. Second, Benson is a complete bitch. I think part of it is that the actress (whom I think is French, since she only seems to have appeared in other French films) is awful. She comes off as totally emotionless and unnecessarily mean (though I can understand why she wouldn't want to be anywhere near her father, she treats Lavin, who always comes off as a nice person, like crap for no reason). Third, Green's cartoon cats often pop up in animated thought bubbles to tease both Green and Benson. This is especially unfunny and hugely obnoxious, particularly since Green voices the cats with his awful, nasal voice. The film does get a little better as it goes on. The cartoons fade away and Green, who starts to appreciate France after he meets Depardieu, calms the Hell down. But it's still utterly unfunny and I'd like to forget it was ever made. 
tt0070438;  Wow, an underwater film shot completely on location - at the bottom of the production designers' fishtank!  This action-drama basically involves about 80 minutes of the main characters staring out of their mini-sub's windshield/projection screen with awestruck expressions at... grainily blown up shots of common acquarium fish.  The "model shots" (a generous naming) actually DO look to have been shot in a common home aquarium, complete with plastic ferns and oversize gravel.  The stretch is so great, the disparity so big, I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.  I think in the end I simply gave up and decided to vomit.  Not sure how Walter Pidgeon took a wrong turn into this turkey, but it is worth noting that about half the cast of "The Black Hole" is featured here - doubtless in a dry run for their performances in that later classic... 
tt0070438; The Neptune Factor deals with some scientists who live and work out of an undersea lab in the Atlantic Ocean. One fine day while their bosses, Walter Pidgeon, Yvette Mimieux, and Ernest Borgnine are up top, an earthquake occurs and the lab topples over into an underwater crevice.Though an atomic power submarine could stay down there indefinitely the problem is that crevice is way too small for one of those big boys. A smaller type submarine able to withstand the pressures of the very deep is needed and that's where Ben Gazzara and his ship the Neptune come in.As disaster films go The Neptune Factor is small potatoes special effects wise. It's a Canadian production and I've seen Hollywood come up with worse films spending a ton more money than was done here.The special effects such as they are, are merely movie films of some ordinary species of marine life blown up several times their size, because these are the creatures the crew finds down at depths that man hasn't been before. It's beautiful undersea photography just like a trip to Marineland.It's a no frills production, no subplots of any kind, no social interaction of any kind with the crew, just do the mission and go home. That's why it was given a G rating when first released.If you love Jacques Cousteau, you'll love this film. 
tt0070438; This waterlogged bore is about 100 minutes but feels about 120 minutes too long. A film so dull even the cast can't rouse itself from lethargy. Yvette Mimieux evidently decided her paycheck was only enough to guarantee that she'd show up, because her performance consists of only one half-lost/blank stare throughout. Borgnine, once again in the water (McHale, Poseidon, etc.) can barely rouse himself to his usual level of histrionics. Gazzara tries a southern accent and fails, while Walter Pigeon plods through his role, obviously taking his check to pad his retirement fund (he actually turned in a fine performance the following year in 'Harry in Your Pocket'). This is a Canadian film, thus it's restricted budget-wise, but why bother making a film like this if you haven't got the money for the special effects? We're talking $1.98 here. It looks like the producers bought a little toy submersible and borrowed someone's aquarium and let er rip. Okay, this is pre-Star Wars, effects-wise, but no one could take this seriously even back in 1973. Oh the look of fear and awe on Borgnine's face when he sees a.... giant goldfish! Perhaps the only thing of (minor) interest is whether James Cameron was inspired by this film to create 'The Abyss.' It does have some of the same elements. Of course, unlike 'The Abyss', this film is idiotic (example: Gazzara yelling at Mimieux for putting the sub in danger of exploding from sea pressure, yet the same pressure has no effect on HUMAN BODIES swimming around in EVEN GREATER DEPTHS soon after), and it's dully plotted, acted, directed, written, scored. Well, it IS consistent! 
tt0070438;  Oceanlab is an experimental station built atop an undersea mountain in theNorth Atlantic somewhere off the coast of Canada. An earthquake strikes,causing the lab to plunge into an unexplored abyss. Three men are trappedaboard and they have only seven days of oxygen remaining.After five days, the Oceanlab team is able to call in a retired naval officer, Commander Blake (Gazzara). Using his deep sea submersible "Neptune II," itis hoped he can locate and rescue the men before they suffocate. The hope is a slim one, all contact with the lab was lost when the earthquake occurred. The submersible must face the hazards of deep sea travel, aftershocks, and somevery unexpected discoveries on the ocean floor.The cast is unusually strong with Ernest Borgnine, Donnelly Rhodes, YvetteMimieux, and Walter Pigeon all putting in good performances. The specialeffects are limited to model work for undersea shots, but the models are decent enough given the year of release. The film starts out well with the openingscore being particularly noteworthy. Unfortunately, once the submersible gets in the water, the viewer is taken for a rather dull ride for the bulk of the film. Suspense is largely absent. In lieu of pacing, the filmmakers subject the viewer to a lot of stock fish footage. While this was decent enough, it was overused and probably better suited to a nature documentary. Ultimately, the screenplayneeded some serious work. There is insufficient substance to make this workeven as a one hour Twilight Zone or Outer Limits episode. "The NeptuneFactor" otherwise possessed all of the elements necessary to make a successful and compelling adventure film.  
tt0070438; For a movie about a race against the clock to rescue a group of scientists trapped in an undersea research facility that's been hit by an earthquake, The Neptune Factor is incredibly dull. The problem is that for most of the movie, nothing happens. Ernest Borgnine (who I'll give a little credit as he does his best with this snoozer of a script), Ben Gazzara, and company spend most of the movie on a slow motion tour of the ocean floor looking for their missing colleagues. Garzzara is the worst, showing the same kind of emotion usually reserved for everyday, mundane tasks like doing the laundry or grocery shopping. You'd hardly know from his demeanor that the lives of three people rest in his hands. And when something does finally happen the special effects are so ridiculous looking that the movie losses any credibility it might have had. The "giant" sea creatures the rescuers run into are little more than normal salt water aquarium fish filmed with a zoom lens and a bad looking miniature of the submarine. That's right Â<U+0096> The Neptune Factor looks like it was filmed in someone's home aquarium. A giant clown fish Â<U+0096> oooooh, how scary! There's nothing much more frightening than the sight of a ludicrously large Nemo.To say I was disappointed by The Neptune Factor would be a gross understatement. A good cast is put to waste with nothing to do. In the end, I've got to rate this one a 2/10. 
tt0070438; Undersea disaster! Submarine is sent to save explorers from over-sized iridescent catfish! This was an absolutely horrible film, basically filmed by combining actors with normal, harmless tropical fish. The budget must have been incredible -- hire lackluster actors (of course, Ernest Borgnine is an exception) and buy a fish tank! If you give it a title reminiscent of Kubrick maybe people will think it's great! Plus we can tie it in with aquarium sales and pet shops! Lots of nice colors but the film was one of the worst ever...and not "fun" bad like "Manos" or "Plan Nine" -- I mean truly bad, boring, stupid, inept...the list goes on and on. 
tt0070438; Not as exciting as the box cover artwork might suggest, with a painfully stilted characterisation by Ben Gazzara and capable supporting cast trapped in one-dimensional roles. The story concerns militant, officious salvage expert (Gazzara) contracted by an aquatic research team to recover a stricken underwater manned probe that has descended into a deep sea ravine. Gazzara makes it clear from the outset that his goal is only to locate the vessel for insurance purposes, except Mimieux's companion is one of those aboard and she ups the ante in spite of escalating challenges.Pidgeon and Borgnine have little opportunity to establish any characterisation, while Mimieux simply frets and affects anxiety to demonstrate her 'depth' of character. The friction between her and Gazzara is about the only palpable action in the whole picture. The special effects consist of intense magnification of gold fish and other aquarium species, while endless jolts and turbulence puts you in the environmental context. As far as dialogue goes, the technical spec consists mainly of references to rudder malfunction and oxygen saturation. Riveting stuff.Disappointingly, the film ends abruptly where it could have developed a more convincing, compelling climax. After waiting 95 minutes, the audience is treated to a Jules Verne moment in which 'giant' eels corral the probe's survivors as they run out of oxygen. But just as the action gains momentum, the film ends. Five more minutes of that encounter might have earned another star, but this underwater adventure is mostly talk and no action. 
tt0070438; I was completely unimpressed with THE NEPTUNE FACTOR when I, then all of twelve years old, saw the movie in its original 1973 theatrical release. When I discovered the film available on DVD, I decided to revisit it on the chance that it had simply been over my then-youthful head--and upon seeing it again realized that I was a pretty good judge of films even way back then. Simply put, THE NEPTUNE FACTOR bites a big one.The plot was hackneyed even in 1973: an earthquake shakes up an undersea lab and a "special submarine" is dispatched to find out what has happened down there. They go down, down, down to the bottom of the sea, they look out the submarine window, and they see... some really big fish. Yep, that's about all there is to it. They look at some really big fish.Now, the cast itself isn't bad at all. After all, it includes Walter Pigdeon, Ben Gazzara, Ernest Borgnine, Yvette Mimieux--and they are very capable players. And they give it their all, but they just can't get a lot of mileage out of it, particularly when the really big fish are just really big (and pretty grainy) close ups of little fish that you might find in somebody's home aquarium. And then there's the submarine itself, which is clearly a plastic model, and which seems to have filmed at the bottom of a kiddie wading pool with some plastic seaweed stuff thrown in.If this sounds boring, well, it is. Now and then a really bad film can become accidentally entertaining. It may be so bad that it's astonishing, as in PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE. It may be so bad that it's endearing, like ATTACK OF THE 50 WOMAN. But most bad films are just dull and boring, and when it comes to dull and boring THE NEPTUNE FACTOR is working hard to lead the pack. Give it a miss.GFT, Amazon Reviewer 
tt0070438; The mystery, the excitement, the dangerÂ  ah the boredom of getting wet. The Canadian production "The Neptune Factor" is a typical underwater disaster adventure that rarely gets going and when it does it's quite an unremarkable and unimaginative forayÂ  in a cheaply presented magnified fish tank. The problem is like a lot of other reviewers mentioned, is that nothing much happens. A lot of peering and ponderous talkingÂ  with little interest to it all. A group of American scientists are conducting an experiment involving underwater living until an earthquake occurs causing a research facility to fall into the abyss. They only have so many hours before they're out of oxygen, so a crew in a mini submarine are sent down to find them despite the risks of more aftershocks. Really the taut situation that unfolds should sell it in a threatening, pressure-induced manner, but instead we get a padded out story with a very limp rhythm. No urgency left it with any sustained suspense lingering only on stolid dramas of a threadbare narrative and static direction. There's a few dazzling glimpses when the crew is exploring the murky abyss, but the model sub and the overblown sea life didn't create any sort of thrills and when it tried it was quite laughable in its execution. The performances don't fair any better, despite the best efforts of Ernest Borgnine and Walter Pidgeon. As for Ben Gazzera and Yvette Mimieux, they come across very bland. Composer Lalo Schifran contributes the score. Established, but too plain to be fun. 
tt0070438; Not a bad effort, really, given that the film was made during the age of Cousteau. Underwater filming of deep ocean life had not been accomplished. Now we know what it looks like way down there, so the fish tank 'special effects' really ruin the story. The first sight of a clown fish is like a slap in the face! The film becomes a comedy after that! But really, this is only because science education (as miserable as it may be) has advanced SO MUCH on television. Now we can sit on our sofa and watch animal planet to get a better seminar on deep ocean life than marine biologists of the day received! So, if you're looking for a top-notch special effects masterpiece, the toy sub floating in the Monterey Bay aquarium's fish tanks probably won't cut it. Nevertheless, it's an entertaining few minutes, anyway. I say, watch it and try to forget about reality for a while. Pretend you're TEN! 
tt0814795; Micha Wald has created a strong masculine drama as writer and director of 'VOLEURS DE CHEVAUX' (IN THE ARMS OF MY ENEMY), a film with a grand sweeping view of nineteenth century life in the region of Russia and has accomplished this with a very small budget, a cast a both unknown and new actors, and a production crew sensitive to place and atmosphere. For some reason the marketing of this film has been directed to a particular audience instead of emphasizing the broad spectrum of those who love epic dramas. It deserves very wide attention, as it is an excellent meditation on the rigors of filial love among the destitute of the period. Part I: Him: Jakub (Adrien Jolivet) is the diminutive but strong older brother of Vladimir (GrA©goire Leprince-Ringuet), a gentle and handsome young lad who depends on Jakub's 'parenting'. The two destitute brothers fend for themselves, dressed in rags, begging for food and work, until they encounter a group of soldiers who are enlisting young men to be Cossacks. Jakub sees the opportunity for food and shelter and 'belonging' and encourages Vladimir to join him in enlisting. The rigors of 'boot camp' drive Jakub to dangerous extremes and result in his being punished and imprisoned for varying periods of time while he still masters fighting techniques and equestrian skills: the more defenseless Vladimir falls victim to abuses at the hands of his fellow recruits. When Jakub discovers that Vladimir has been raped, he resorts to serious fighting and the two brothers are placed in a solitary confinement box. When their training period is over, the boys witness the brutality of the Cossacks as they slaughter innocent families, and this is the breaking point that drives them to desertion. They escape the Cossacks on stolen horses, but while bathing in a river, their horses are stolen. Part II: Them: The horse thieves are two other impoverished brothers with a strong parallel - Roman (GrA©goire Colin) is the stronger, pugilistic older brother who takes care of his younger brother Elias (FranA§ois-RenA© Dupont), a gentle lad crippled in youth by a goring from a ram but who maintains an ability to communicate with animals. They live humbly in a forest shack and an underground hideaway, and when they make their rare excursions into the village tavern, Roman jealously guards the more fragile Elias, threatening even the girl Virina (MylA¨ne St-Sauveur) with whom Elias is infatuated. Using a combination of their skills, Roman and Elias steal the horses of Jakub and Vladimir, and the trail of vengeance begins. Part III: Us: Both sets of brothers are needy and their destinies collide due to the theft of horses. Tragedies mount, both sets of brothers intensify their filial bond of compassion, but the older brothers fight to the death of one and in the end one of the brothers provides succor to the survivor of the other set of brothers and the ending leaves the audience to guess the future altered by violence and need. Micha Wald draws powerful performances from his young cast of beautiful actors and with a minimum of dialogue ( in French with English subtitles) he creates wholly credible characters about whom we care very much. The cinematography by Jean-Paul de Zaetijd is superb and the haunting musical score by JA3hann JA3hannsson, Jeff Mercelis and Stephan Micus is rich in capturing the harmonies of the music of the period and the location. In all, this is a visually stunning film and a story that is subtle and touching and impressively sophisticated in the manner in which it is told. Highly recommended. Grady Harp 
tt0814795; Set "somewhere in the East, around 1856", this action/costume film is a revenge story between two 'couples' of brothers. Jakub and Vladimir, two young Cossacks who suffer terrible humiliations during their military training and Roman and Elias (the two horse thieves of the title). After a terrible tragedy, Jakub leaves his regiment and tracks down the two thieves with what looks like a samurai's sense of honor and dignity. Shot in beautiful landscapes, with a minimum of dialogs, an impressive music, and an epic ambition, this blind and brutal race towards a metamorphosis (to free himself, Jakub will also have to become an outlaw) is also a study of dependence struggles (the two elder ones taking a role of father and imposing their choices to their youngest brothers). To appreciate this film, one needs to be sensitive to children's stories with a simple framework, disregard a certain awkwardness, and accept a very literary narration (three chapters announced by three titles: Him, Them, Manhunt), and a depiction of rough characters, the oldest thief (Roman, played by GrA©goire Colin) almost turning into a kind of caricature.'Voleurs de chevaux' is a sort of equestrian western which was obviously made on a low budget. The reconstitution of a mythical European mid-19th century often misses what the big Masters made of it (one can't help thinking of Kubrick with Barry Lyndon, or Kurozawa with Dersou Ouzala). Micha Vald took a risk, but there is an undeniable 'soul' which animates his beautiful story: the confrontation, crimes and vendetta of the four brothers, bathed in the cold light of a poisonous and solitary nature. Between the end of their adolescence and the beginning of maturity, the four characters compose a striking fresco, which owes most of its success to the actors' performances. One can't help taking one's hat off to this group of very young actors who support the whole film: Adrien Jolivet and Gregoire Leprince-Ringuet on one side, and GrA©goire Colin and FranA§ois-RenA© Dupont on the other side. We won't forget the charm of theses ferocious dogs for quite a while. 
tt0814795; Belgian first-time director Micha Wald says he wanted to say something about brothers. World War II was his first choice but people told him production costs would be too high and that stuff's been done to death anyway. So Wald switched to an almost abstract world of wild boys and macho men, wooded groves and lakes, open shirts, sabers, fur caps, horses, to the region Wald's forebears come from and the time of the Cossacks. This film set "somewhere in the East" in 1857 can't be taken realistically on any level and isn't meant to be. How else would a bunch of Slavs all speak perfect French? It's hard to know how to take it, and for this reason responses have hit opposite extremes. Some French reviewers were enthusiastic, others dismissive. One AllocinA© viewer says "A pure marvel, not to be missed," another, 'Avoid at all costs." Within what everybody acknowledges was a very limited budget, 'Voleurs de chevaux' has daring and sweep. Wald pursues his story with the same intensity as his characters pursue their fates. But it's got a problem, genre-wise, because it's a boy's adventure, full of fear and innocence and exciting teenage daring-do, but it's too violent for kids to watch. And while the early parts are intense and fast-paced, it loses momentum and goes flat later.The story only makes sense as a fairy tale or a myth. Two pairs of brothers come into symbolic, parallel conflict. One pair steals the other's horses and the older of the thieves kills the weaker, younger brother of the pair they victimize by reaching down from his horse and snapping his neck. The bereaved survivor hunts the horse-thief brothers down and kills the older one, taking the younger under his wing as they ride off into the sunset. Along the way there are passages of bracing physicality and rawness but also of extreme violence--not just the harrowing encounters between the opposing brothers but the brutality of a Cossack training camp, and after training, wartime atrocity when the Cossacks wipe out a village, leading the brother recruits to desert.Adrien Jolivet, who plays Jakub, the stronger of the two brothers who join the Cassacks (and later get their horses stolen), has said that the actor who played the Cossack commander he fights with fists and saber (this is Michel Martin, I'm guessing) was an ex-fighter and they used real weapons, and it was all he could to do avoid getting killed. Jakub's younger brother Vladi (GrA©goire Leprince-Ringuet) gets raped and beat up all the time. It's not a great role for Leprince-Ringuet, who's so appealing as the gay boy in HonorA©'s 'Chansons d'amour'--he looks bigger than the wiry Jolivet, and all he gets to do is cringe and weep. To compensate for being a little too slight, though, Jolivet (excellent in his father Pierre's 'Zim and Co.') has an admirable feverish intensity that's convincing for "Le traque," the hunting down, after Roman (GrA©goire Colin) and his damaged, horse-whisperer younger brother Elias (FranA§ois-RenA© Dupont) have lured Vladi's and Jakub's horses away while the other brothers are gamboling in a lake after abandoning the Cossack life. (How that happened wasn't quite clear to me, or how they got to keep the horses.) Roman's relationship to Elias' is similar to Jakub-Vladi's, except that Elias is a drunk and young seducer and Roman is really harsh and violent with him, it's his mean trick when they were little that damaged Elias' leg somehow.Up to the theft of the horses things go pretty well. Then the film loses momentum and gets wobbly, even though the battle between Roman and Jakub that leads to Roman's slow demise is brutal and violent in the extreme. The last effort at raw, unheroic realism is exhausting and repellent, and feels more than anything just like sloppy editing. The two young men give each other deathly wounds, then struggle away on foot and horse only to exchange further blows and collapse in the horse thieves' underground hideaway. It leaves you feeling beaten down and hopeless. The closing shot of Jakub riding across the horizon with Elias riding a horse behind him almost saves things. It's a resolution in keeping with the film's mostly non-verbal style and fairy-tale overtones. There's a strange art-house purity about this effort, but I have a sick feeling that if Wald gets a lot more money he'll just make something overblown and pointless like Laurent Boutonnat's 'Jacquou le croquant.'Three of the young actors are already well known, especially Colin, an actor almost since birth, used repeatedly by Clair Denis and notable for his relaxed physicality and his ability to slide easily into very diverse roles. Leprince-Ringuet and Jolivet are both very promising, charismatic young actors, just not altogether suitably cast as brothers. FranA§ois-RenA© Dupont was a 17-year-old unknown, chosen for his presence, good looks, and in particular for the fact that he'd ridden horses from the age of six. Wald shows a certain panache, but his scenario is spotty and his editing questionable. With its physical intensity and occasional sweeping landscapes this is a film it would have been better to see in a theater than on a computer via DVD, but it never got to American theaters and may not have spent very long in French ones. It was included in the "Semaine de la critique" at Cannes in 2007 and its special nature will win it a following. We'll see where the director goes from here. 
tt0814795; I first saw this film at the 2008 Philadelphia Film Festival in April and I was completely blown away by it. With its hyper-link structure, fascinating characters and distinctive visual and aural style, In The Arms Of My Enemy is the reason I go to movies in the first place!The film begins with two AWOL Cossacks, Jakub (Adrien Jolivet) and his younger brother Vladimir (Gregoire Leprince-Ringuet) swimming in a small river. Unbeknownst to them while they frolic, two young horse thieves, Roman (Gregoire Colin) and his younger brother Elias (Francois-Rene Dupont) are creeping up and in a flash, they steal the Cossacks' horses. This leads us into the first section of this film, all connected by this incident at the river.Here we meet Jakub and Vladimir and discover how they came to be on that riverbank getting their horses stolen. The time is the early 19th Century, somewhere in Eastern Europe and Jakub and Vlad are two dirt-poor souls with no apparent family and nothing else to keep them together than their own brotherly love.Jakub is slight and easily excitable, very much the kind who over-compensates for being physically tiny and while his brother Vlad is taller, he is the more sensitive of the two boys and we get the feeling that Jakub has been stepping in to protect Vlad his whole life. But right now, times are extremely tough and these two boys have been literally reduced to stealing crusts of bread for sustenance along with the occasional pickle from the tables of customers at a roadside inn.Just then, some Cossacks come into the inn and ask if there are any men brave enough and strong enough to join them? Jakub thinks that he and Vlad should join the Cossacks, although Vlad is apprehensive, Jakub convinces him that, with winter coming, if they were with the Cossacks, they would at least be clothed and fed.Convincing Vlad to join was one thing, convincing the Cossack officers to let them join is another. One Cossack officer is particularly cruel towards Jakub because of Jakub's diminutive stature and thinks Jakub is mentally handicapped, but he relents and lets the two boys join.Cossack training is tough (think of the basic training scenes in Full Metal Jacket, but not so hygienic) and Jakub, because he is so quick to anger, finds himself frequently in trouble and spends a good deal of time locked up in a sweat-box for punishment. When Jakub is out of the picture, Vladimir is often beset upon by the other boys and when he's not being raped, he is being mentally tormented and abused.After much misadventure, Jakub and Vlad graduate and soon come to realize that being a Cossack is nasty business. Neither one is happy about all the wanton murdering and pillaging that Cossacks are required to do and this leads them to go AWOL and eventually to the river where their horses get stolen.We then move into the second part of the film where we learn about Roman and Elias. They are also poor and have no family but make a small living as thieves and they maintain a very nifty hideout buried in the forest floor. We learn that Elias has some kind of gift that allows him to communicate with animals, especially horses whereas his older brother Roman is the more practical of the two as well as the more cynical.We learn about a time when they were boys when through Roman's carelessness and cowardice, Elias received a severe injury to his right leg and now walks with a pronounced gimp. But it has made Roman hyper-protective of Elias and he gets jealous of Elias even meeting other people.This all takes us back to the original horse theft scene and during this confrontation, Vlad is killed by Roman and this sets us up for the final part of the film where Jakub, consumed by revenge stalks Roman and finds that he may be able to get to Roman through his brother Elias. But Elias, who is unaware of Vlad's death and of who Jakub really is, sees Jakub as basically a decent person, which he is, albeit on the excitable side.This does not comfort Roman who understands it will be either kill or get killed with Jakub. The whole film now hurtles towards a devastating finale and then on to a reconciliation that is beautiful, amazing and completely surprising, at least it was to me.What really makes this film work as a superior piece of film craft, aside from the gorgeous cinematography, the believable settings and costumes along with the fantastic music, is the undeniable charm of the four leading actors. Without them, this film would be nothing.All four are gorgeous in their own unique ways but looking at the DVD cover art, I fear this film will be marketed towards a gay demographic, which would be a shame. That would limit In The Arms Of My Enemy solely to its homo-erotic appeal and, although that is definitely there, this film has more to offer than just masculine eye candy. This film has a very original human drama and looks deeply into the kind of close relationships between brothers that you don't see in many other films.In The Arms Of My Enemy is very well made, considering its low budget. Director Micha Wald only had some forests, fields and rivers to film in, yet he manages to make a visually interesting piece. It is amazing just how much emotion and narrative can be conveyed by simple looks from the actors and easy, elegant camera moves.A note to all low-budget filmmakers, study this film for tips on how to get the most visual bang for your independent buck.This is truly one film you will have to see to appreciate and I sincerely hope more people do. 
tt0814795; Truly this is such a great film. Right from the start you will be gripped by this film and you will sit watching it with total attention until its completion. The drama is so well constructed, but there is so much more to the film than that.The four main characters are two sets of brothers surviving on the edge. Life at the beginning of the 19th century is very tough and so these brothers are very closely bonded. You might say there is a homo-erotic element to this film, however although I am a gay many myself I don't think these closely bonded males are in any way being depicted as gay. I think rather, they cling to each other because that is all the security they have.I watched this film at home and a friend had suggested it to me. I didn't know anything about it before I started watching it. I think that it is probably set in Ukraine, but I am not sure. A quick bit of googling has not been very fruitful, from that I read simply that it is set in Eastern Europe.The dialogue is sparse and in French. I watched it with English subtitles. However character development is excellent and the acting is first class as well.I have not seen any films by Micha Wald before and I will most definitely be watching his other films in due course. 
tt0814795; So far I've watched this film twice, without the assistance of subs though I don't understand French - to have been entirely enthralled throughout. Seldom are films of this caliber made, with what can be imagined as totally unrelenting period authenticity combined with unflinching performances by the well-cast leads. If there were only 7 truly different fictions in existence, just told slightly varying ways - this must be story #8. It has an utterly refreshing originality about it which reveals human nature in a raw sort of honest way we should see much more often. The degree of homo-eroticism is variable depending on your point of view - though very subtle, it is certainly there in appropriate proportions. Bound to become a cult classic! 
tt0814795; Brutal to the point of pointless. The over-repeated ring of bones crunching, snapping and breaking is what you shall take away with you. A wasted opportunity, considering the time, place and people in history are much neglected by western cinema.The violence, which hogs everything, even itself becomes dramatically repetitive. The whole, inevitable, boring thing underscored by a vaguely religious male choral electronic musical voice which becomes camper and camper as the violence becomes more absurd.The landscape is all but ignored. The people largely reduced and the protagonists used to synthesize the maker's own indulgent idea of tragedy and masculine beauty. Sadly,the taught notion that thoughtless brutality is somehow elevating when contrasted with the prettiness of youth (or is it meant to be the other way around?) just felt immature rather than informed or emotionally meaningful.Such a waste. Just to add in it's favour, that the leads did bring good performances. 
tt0113312;  Both Candela PeA±a and Silke are fantastic as "Trini" and "La NiA±a", two girls who decide to run away together to get rich. Whilst they don't quite achieve their financial aim, they do discover a lot about themselves, deal with several personal issues weighing them down, and cement their friendship through learning to rely on each other. Silke is utterly believable as the girl who resents the fact that her mother abandoned her and her father as a child, and Candela PeA±a plays the role of an orphan who so desperately needs a mother she is willing to borrow NiA±a's. The two laugh, cry and make love to a Russian across the Spanish plain, and we are fortunate enough to become a part of their world for the film's duration. I thoroughly enjoyed it, a great debut effort by IcA­ar Bollain - Â!enhorabuena, guapa! 
tt0113312;  Fresh comedy directed by former actress -now more centered in the work behind the camera- Iciar Bollain. The movie mixes -with the magic of simplicity and crude dialogues- the drama of two girls looking for sense in their lives. Candela PeA±a showed here she's the natural substitute of Carmen Maura in Spain for this kind of tragicomic roles. Silke, making her debut here too, magnetized the audiences with her mysterious personality. Alex Angulo, usual actor of Alex De la Iglesia's movies, is great too here. Good time guaranteed!    
tt1679204; Hjelp, vi er i filmbransjen is a good idea, and has lots of well known Norwegian stand up comedians and actors. They all do their job, as does Peter Stormare.But that doesn't help anything to the script. A comedy should be a fun movie to watch. This movie is, I'm afraid, plain boring all the way. The lines are not funny, and the romance in this is just awful.Maybe even 2 out of 10 is too good. Writing about it a day after gives me trouble in remember anything other than the lame dragon and Peter Stormare in a couple of sick scenes.Norwegian films have had a very good reputation for the last years. Films like this one, can ruin this reputation. This film is made as an idiotic American comedy, but this doesn't suit a Norwegian film.Stop raising funds to bad comedies. 
tt1679204; I didn't like this movie, at all. The characters in this movie are known from their show "torsdag kveld fra Nydalen" on norwegian TV2 and this show is actually quite funny. Compared to this show, the movie is a huge disappointment and I would like to get a refund if this was possible. There are several reasons for this: # 1. The story is very bad written. Actually, there isn't any plot. The movie could be one hour shorter, without losing any of it's content. 2. The acting performance is poor 3. You know how the movie will end, almost from the first second. 4. Several left during the movie. I wanted to do the same, several times. 5. To much explicit language. Cursing and swearing is neither funny nor improves the movie in any way 6. Worst of all: It just isn't funny. Where is the humor? Am I supposed to laugh now? Nobody else is laughing? Is this supposed to be a comedy? Drama? Or a documentary? 
tt1679204; There is only three reasons to see this movie. 1. Jenny Skavlan is hot 2. Julia Schact is cute 3. Marte Germaine Christensen is cute in a girl next door way.There is no real plot in this movie, the scrips is so incredibly bad I am not just embarrassed to watch, I am embarrassed to be Norwegian.I wanted to quit watching several times, but each time, by some kind of perverse curiosity of how they wore to mess up the next scene, I unfortunately kept watching... Don't do this mistake yourself, it is horrible, and not even in a funny cult movie way. It just plain sucks.All in all, it was probably a good intention by the producers, but the end result is so horribly bad I would have more fun counting the wrinkles on my balls. 
tt0085893;  In Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, James Joyce pokes a little fun at Stephen Daedelus' aesthetics. Daedelus says there are two extremes in art--the kinetic and the static.  Static art is beauty of the mind, or Apollonian beauty.  Kinetic is more akin to sexual desire, or Dionysian beauty. Though Joyce found this theory to be rife for satire, albeit gentle satire, I think the distinction is compelling.This film is in part about this distinction, or rather the absence of it in one man.  For Charles Bremer, all beauty is erotic.  For some reason, emotional or physical, he can't participate in the act of love, so he sublimates it into art.  For him, seeing a beautiful painting or a beautiful woman undressing are two instances of the same thing, both equally erotic and equally profound.All this babble makes the film sound pretentious, but in practice it is actually almost completely unpretentious.  It has something profound to say, but it says it very simply. If there is a little bit of Charles in you, you will understand this film implicitly.  If there isn't, then nothing will help you, because all of the great things the film has to say are unspoken.  All is said with mood and characterization. The music, largely from Lucia di Lammermoor, is put to probably the best use that any music in any film ever has been.  The 16mm flash backs with Werner Herzog (yes, THE Werner Herzog) playing Charles' father are brilliant and beautifully balletic, as if they had been choreographed gesture by gesture by the director.The day I saw Man of Flowers in the theater, I walked out into the sunlight and looked at the world a little differently.  That was in 1984, when I was 17 years old.  And I'm still moved by the experience. 
tt0085893; In my language, there's a different word for erotic and non-erotic love. English has just one word for the two. And Charles, the main character in this story, doesn't even make a distinction. The attraction he feels to flowers or classical music is erotic, as is his attachment to his mother, at the same time, he's unable to consummate a sexual relationship. He's a profoundly lonely person, who writes letters to himself and buys 'human relationships' in the form of a doctor or a stripper to whom he hardly talks. Lisa, in turn, is just as lonely: her boyfriend hardly talks to her, only takes her money to spend on drugs. This film is about the isolation of modern people, the impossibility to create relationships. Charles sublimates this longing into a fondness for all art and beauty, others escape into drugs or pointless 'creation'. And the question arises: why am I watching this film? What am I substituting with it? 
tt0085893; Charles Bremer, an elderly man, is a little eccentric. His love for flowers is only equaled by his love for watching a pretty woman undress. He lives on his own, plays the organ in church and tends to stick to himself. Things don't go really fast for him, until the drug addicted boyfriend of the girl he pays to strip for him turns violent.Nudity, classical music, long slow scenes with a lot of colors, emotional darkness. That'd be the general description of the film in a few words. It'd be a great injustice to this little film though. The story is played out amazingly well, with a very acceptable explanation of the Man of Flowers, and why he is who he is and all.The choice of musical overdub in this film, sometimes blotting out everything that is happening completely, reminded me a bit of A Clockwork Orange, although that film is almost entirely unlike this one. It works out very well though, pushing the accentuation in just the right direction when that is needed. Clearly a well done case of film-making.8 out of 10 flowers in the air 
tt0085893;  A wonderful slow, gentle film, full of strange characters. I loved the eccentricities of all the characters, the mad painter, the crazy psychiatrist, the main character, Charles, who is obsessed by flowers. Even the postman who delivers the letters Charles sends to himself every day is delightful. The characters are surrounded by wonderful images and the background music is absolutely divine. The rather freudian storyline follows the relationships between Charles, a rich eccentric artist, a young woman he pays to strip for him and her violent boyfriend. I liked the strength of Charles's character despite his gentleness, which leads to  a good twist at the end. I loved it. 
tt0085893; This is a classy movie!!! I saw it by chance nearly 20 years ago & it remains one of my great memories of the cinema! Back then, I thought this loner was intriguing but nothing more. In this world's terms, he was a loser, a grief-stricken man sending letters to his deceased mother, friend of the postman, lover of fine art! In his eccentric kingdom that the palatial few are privileged to find! But his complex nature is balanced by the puritanical historical background he is enlivened by, privileged by, but too, imprisoned by! So he sits at his lonely piano in a deserted church of grandeur! Playing his heart out!!!A perfect Catholic solution by the reckoning of some Â  without hope of any resolution!!! It reminds me of a pair of REAL priests! One who liked to use his Sunday sermons for derision & cynical responses! Another who used pillars of the church to distribute confessions of trusting practitioners! When I was a little boy, hearing for the first time of the "Good Samaritan", I couldn't believed that a priest would walk by on the opposite side of the road, to the injured & beaten collapsed man who was cared for by the rich young man & the innkeeper the hero paid for the keep of the downtrodden one! But there's chambers of music & gardens of intrigue wafting with or without audience here! The settings & the musical background are most impressive, from the fineries of the outside garden, to the gardens that are revealed to us layer by layer in the relationships of the protagonist to the beautiful female model who undresses for the man of mystery, on appointment, to the crass judgemental nature of her accomplice & lover in his satire of derision. Or even in the art classes where this trio mingles in a volatile atmosphere within seconds! The chemical reaction is furious!This is NOT a good movie! It is a CLASSIC!!! Personally, I rate this with "Cinema Paridiso", as one of the finest films ever made!!! Do NOT miss it! 
tt0085893; I've seen many films by Paul Cox but only one or two continue to impress me after all these years - Man of Flowers (1983) is one of them. Taking on familiar Cox themes such as loneliness and sexual repression, Man of Flowers adds an eloquent European feel to its Australian setting. Although the story is not a conventional linear narrative, Cox combines distinctive visual tones (super-8 flashbacks/ conventional framing such as the striptease at the beginning)) to capture different aspects of the protagonist's reclusive life (played by Norman Kaye). What is unique about this film is its refusal to subscribe to any cinematic norm. Thus we get a philosophical postman who adds a touch of off-centered eccentricity to an already edgy patchwork of lesbianism, blackmail and oedipal longing. The only sad aspect of the film is its low-budget which has seriously impaired its standing as a classic. The sound is not the best on VHS although the operatic score (Donizetti's "Lucia di Lammermoor) more than compensates for this flaw. I presume the original budget of $250,000 was not spent enhancing the sound quality. 
tt0085893;  Warning: detailed review-----  The film, Man of Flowers explores the murky and mysterious Freudian world of psychologically disturbed behaviour - the unconscious mental urges produced by denial of painful past experiences. Director, Paul Cox portrays how those deeply buried torments are so tortuously twisted when reemerging within the conscious mind. In this case, the cause of the sinister deviance being the originally repressed, oedipal sexual infatuation of a young boy (Charles Bremner) for his mother. Now matured into adulthood, the consequences of the boy's unresolved mental morass are both delightful and deadly. The stifled erotic obsession not only mentally metamorphoses into a richly cultured and critical appreciation of the arts, but also  poses a dire threat to the perceived psychological father figure, who, threateningly, represents a modern-day rival  for the mother's sexuality.----- Confused already?  Coherently translating such complex human mental meanderings to the cinematic screen is no simple task. Paul Cox not only thrives on the challenge, but, in Man of Flowers, admirably succeeds in immersing us in the pathos of his tormented heroes.-----The principal character, Charles Bremner, is a wealthy, eccentric, gentle man who loves, or rather, is obsessed with the harmony of form and colour - the aesthetics of visual art.  He admires skilled creativity, often stopping and physically caressing the sculpted, sensuous form of artworks on his many long walks throughout the city parks.  He particularly adores the delicate, natural beauty of flowers and is a frequent customer at the local florists where he orders exotic arrangements for his finely decorated home, complementing the many examples of his discerning taste. He is a scholarly man. A would be artist himself. A connoisseur of style and cultural excellence.----- However, it is apparent that Charles has a  hidden problem - a behavioural disorder. He visits his psychologist for help and  we slowly realise that Charles is sexually impotent, unable to become naturally aroused unless stimulated by the aesthetics of form and beauty. When we see Charles sensuously stroking various  objects d'art, we realise that he is mentally masturbating - pleasuring himself-----The brilliantly effective series of flashback photographic sequences, shot in nonprofessional, hand-held, 16 mm format, offers the audience an historical perspective on Charles' dilemma and an explanation for his strange behaviour. Through the soundless, sepia toned, home-movie styled shots, we glimpse Charles, as a young boy, sexually infatuated with his mother (arguably, the result of an earlier unresolved Freudian, `Oedipal Complex' - the boy, as an infant, being sexually attracted to his mother, and viewing the father as a threat to this psycho sexual  relationship). The ethereal  quality of the photography gives the scenes a symbolic dreamlike connotation.  This further emphasises the Freudian repressed psychological connection, as we witness Charles making overt sexual advances to his mother (and antoher woman). The advances are sadistically reprimanded by his father, who humiliatingly hauls the boy away from the scene by his ear, indicating the likelihood of some forthcoming harsh punishment  - perhaps a sound thrashing - thereby repressing the whole disastrous episode deeply within the boy's unconscious mind.----- Lisa is a likable, highly attractive, sensual, long-suffering woman, seemingly trapped in an abusive relationship with a  misogynistic, starving artist, whose frustration over his questionable talents and lack of recognition is exacerbated by a  heavy cocaine habit. Lisa increasingly resents her sorry predicament, but continues to  financially support her boyfriend's artistic aspirations and drug dependent lifestyle. In order to supplement her income she moonlights as an artist's model. Charles, as a would-be artist, is drawn to her  sensuous beauty, and hires Lisa to pose at his home each week.------ In Charles' splendid salon, the visually rich mise en scene shots, accompanied by the exotic operatic tones of Lucia di Lammermoor, feature a frame-centred Lisa slowly and erotically removing her clothing piece by piece, displaying the sheer  physical beauty of her body.  Meanwhile an enraptured but tense Charles sits unobtrusively (almost off screen) voyeuristically watching her performance. The actors are surrounded by a jungle of exquisite flower arrangements, exotic furniture and Charles' splendid collection of paintings and various artistic creations. The  scene exemplifies beauty as his erotic fetish and informs us that Charles desperately needs the stimulation of beauty to function sexually.----- Although perplexed, Lisa becomes rather fond of this strange, cultured man. She feels a compassion for his loneliness. Perhaps, she even senses his sexual dilemma as she finally stands naked in front of a now tense Charles to tentatively enquire: `Do you want anything else?' Charles, tongue-tied, and befuddled, mumbles an anguished `no',  and staggers out of the house to a church across the street where he wildly plays the organ to an orgasmic crescendo. The irony of the sexually charged mise en scene is demonstrated by the sombre, sanctified surroundings of  the church and the stoic minister approaching Charles, congratulating him on being such a good man who is much appreciated by the local congregation, contrasted with the climatic eruption of organ music as Charles finally metaphorically releases  his frenzied passions.----- Using surrealistic characters, Cox continues the theme of psychological personality extremes throughout the movie: the philosopher postman who exchanges long intellectual dialogues with Charles as he delivers the letters that Charles has written to his dead mother and then mailed to himself.  The dominatrix like instructor in Charles drawing class reveals her lack of artistic sensitivity, barking military style orders to her students. The morbid, clinically depressed psychologist attempting to help Charles resolve his own problems. These larger than life characters further enrich the mentally murky mood that permeates the film. ----- Man of Flowers is intended be viewed as a psychologically erotic drama exploring one man's kink, his unconscious repressed sexual urgings and how they are represented in his conscious world. As such, the movie is laced with sexual imagery: the beautiful Lisa sensuously stripping off her clothes to the surging operatic tones of Lucia di Lammermoor,  a Woody Allen like, pathetic Charles standing, full-frontal nude and limply impotent, unarroused by the sexually playful  female swimmers. The gratuitous lesbian scene, involving Lisa and her friend was  designed by Lisa to  stimulate Charles, but it fell very flat, and went nowhere.  The result  is a missed opportunity to excite the viewer with a valid supporting shot of  sensual imagery as further evidence of Charles fetish for erotic beauty. perhaps Charles' aestheticisation of sex is so complete that no amount of sexual provocation can ever stimulate him.-----The complex mental maze often stretches the audience's comprehension. Much like the mentally disturbed themselves, we are unsure just what the real motives are.  Just  what  is Charles doing and why he is doing it?  We are aware that his compulsion is sexual gratification through beauty. Much is left to our own interpretation and when the film ends we are perhaps as confused as Charles is. What was the implication of Charles returning those club like objects to their rack in his garden - were they the murder weapons? Did then, Charles kill Lisa's abusive boyfriend in order to protect her - his `little flower' - and claim her precious beauty all for himself? Or, in fact, did Charles actually kill Lisa herself, in order to permanently preserve her exquisite physical form. And the final bizarre touch, did Charles then `bronze' either Lisa's or her boyfriend's body and mount the statue in the park in order that he may perpetually admire the beauty he so longingly coveted? We are really not sure what actually finally happened.------ Despite these shortfalls, Paul Cox succeeds in his intention of creating empathy for our mentally tormented hero. Charles Bremner may be an odd, impotent, murderous, voyeuristic, sexual deviant, but, despite all the negative characteristics, he is an essentially decent and well intended human being. Furthermore, he represents a certain elegant, albeit wacky, sophistication and  refinement - rare qualities in today's crude and vulgar society.  
tt0085893;  The storyline is secondary to the telling of the hero. The journeys into his (our) madness (?) are beautiful beautiful, as are we in our most tender selves. I suggest seeing the film of course, I also suggest regular visits to our tender self. The natural beauty of the model is astonishing. 
tt0085893;  A terrifically watchable film, so different from Hollywood style movies that stick to a set pattern. Funny, riveting and erotic in parts, this is a true classic that deserves wider recognition. Alyson Best's strip must be the best opening scene in any film! 
tt0085893; A middle-aged man is unable to have relationships with women, apparently a byproduct of his strict upbringing we learn via flashbacks. It is by turns provocative, funny, and pretentious, but always interesting and definitely quirky. Kaye is well cast as the man-child in search of beauty while Best is lovely as one of the objects of his affection. Among the amusing characters are the philosophical postman and Best's hack artist boyfriend. Cox directs with a sense of freshness, helped considerably by the ever-present music from Donizetti's "Lucia di Lammermoor." The flashback scenes of Kaye's childhood are tinged with Oedipal feelings, simultaneously sad and erotic. 
tt0072030; When the single middle-aged Luis (JosA© Luis LA3pez VA!zquez) travels from Barcelona to bury the remains of his mother in the vault of his family in Segovia, he is lodged by his aunt Pilar (Lola Cardona) in her old house where he spent his summer of 1936 with her. He meets his cousin Angelica, who was his first love, living on the first floor with her husband and daughter, and he recalls his childhood in times of the Spanish Civil War entwined with the present.This sensitive movie is a touching love story having the background of the beginning of the Spanish Civil War with the coup d'A<U+0089>tat of General Francisco Franco in July 1936. The original resource of Carlos Saura, using the same actor (JosA© Luis LA3pez VA!zquez) representing the boy and the man, is awesome. The forbidden love for his cousin, the dogmatic education of the Catholic Church, the relationship with his family are revived by Luis in this simple and unknown gem. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "A Prima AngA©lica" ("The Cousin Angelica") 
tt0072030; "La prima AngA©lica" (1974) is one of the most sensitive and important movies of Carlos Saura. Set in 1974, one of the most transcendental moments in Spain with the debacle of franquism, the film is a wonderful portrayal of the effects of the Spanish civil war in a family and the love that Luis -great JosA© Luis LA3pez VA!zquez- feels about his cousine AngA©lica -beautiful Lina Canalejas-. The childhood, the adolescence of both -Luis and AngA©lica- and their forbidden love is seen in the past and in the present with a nice nostalghia. Carlos Saura creates a great love story with an historical background -spanish civil war- and shows to the audience a passional game between past and present reality. "La prima AngA©lica" is for me one of the most important movies of the Spanish Cinema. This is one of the masterpieces of Carlos Saura. 
tt0072030; For this year, I have decided to concentrate on movies favourably appraised by the two guides I grew up with Â<U+0096> Leslie Halliwell's and Leonard Maltin's Â<U+0096> or were otherwise mentioned in a couple of polls ranking the top films of all time. With this in mind, of about a score of Saura titles in my possession and which I had opted to schedule for viewing on the occasion of his birthday, the number has been reduced to just 5 Â<U+0096> and these are not necessarily among his more renowned or even intriguing efforts!The film under review falls, to my mind, in the latter category Â<U+0096> despite its having won the Jury Prize at Cannes. Having now watched it for myself, there is no doubt that COUSIN ANGELICA is indeed worthy of merit, however, I must also admit that it was rather heavy-going an experience for a number of reasons. First off, it seems to me that certain native film-makers are obsessed with the Spanish Civil War Â<U+0096> since it regularly features in their work (as here), and yet the conflict eventually comes to have no real bearing on the central plot! In the same vein, there is a distinct whiff of anti-clericalism (including nightmarish visions of a worm-infested and stigmata-bearing nun) running through it but, again, no specific point is being made by this stance!Incidentally, I wonder why such an ordinary title (which also misleadingly equates it with a contemporaneous sub-genre in Italian cinema!) was chosen for a film that is essentially so rich in subtext Â<U+0096> relating to the impossible love affair at the heart of the narrative between the single protagonist and his unhappily married cousin Â<U+0096> especially since several actors play multiple roles throughout while the hero remains the same, i.e. middle-aged, the entire time (even when supposed to be a child and, at one point, gets to see himself as he is imagining a meeting with his own long-dead parents)! Curiously enough, the end titles reveal that the film was dedicated to Charles and Oona Chaplin, the parents of Saura's then-companion (and frequent collaborator) Geraldine who, however, does not appear in this one...and I do wonder what the British comic made of the whole thing! 
tt0799772; You can't get much more minimalist than this. Two characters- Don Quixote and Sancho Panza (remarkably fat, as all they seem have to to eat are a few walnuts)- wander across Spain, filmed in very long takes using natural light, the camera hardly bothering about what is in front of it, with hardly any music (when a guitar plays a short melody after about ninety minutes it is an astonishing shock) and hardly any action. They talk, minimally- the Don giving Sancho orders, go for a swim, sleep. The Don shouts challenges to imaginary enemies who do not answer him. Eventually, in a mysterious dream-like scene, four horsemen silently carry away the Don. Sancho, left with the don's sword, chops down herbs with it and answers questions about his relations with the Don and why he serves him. The two meet up again and wander on. Eventually the don dies. End of film after nearly two hours. That makes it sound more eventful than it actually is. There is a curious pointlessness and banality about everything that happens- for example, the camera watches an almost-dark patch for minutes on end, with the stems of two plants moving in the wind and- with a shock- when he moves we realise that the Don's face was behind them all the time. Once you adjust you realise that there are astonishing and beautiful shots, but you have to adjust to a zen quality in it. i'm certainly glad to have seen the film, but I certainly wouldn't want to see it again. 
tt0799772; This movie started off slow and then went even slower and then in reverse and then it really went south. The Don and Sancho are in a field where the Don wants his armor cleaned. After a few minutes of silence, Don asks Sancho "where is my armor?", a few more minutes pass and he again asks "Sancho, where is my armor?" A minute or two later, Sancho, who needs to go on the Biggest Loser despite surviving on nuts and herbs, grovels around and finds some armor laying around and turns it over a few times and then lays it down. A couple of more minutes go by and the Don asks for a third time for his armor and Sancho throws it over to him. I guess it was just spotless as he didn't even put it on and we advance to the next scene in which they are going to find a camp that Sancho is going to choose. They travel for hours and end up about a hundred yards on the other side of the field with the same hill in the background where they were in the first riveting scene. After another long debate, it gets dark and they speak about once very few minutes. I sat and watched a black screen for ten minutes without a spoken word. I finally just broke out laughing which didn't offend anyone as the "crowd" in the theater had thinned from five to two. To top all of it off, this entire movie is filmed in some dead language that not even the people who live in the area this supposedly took place, don't even speak anymore. This film would be great on Mystery Science Theater 3000 or to punish your kids with when they are bad. It might even come in handy for use in prisons. I have been trying to get a copy to show at parties but it is only available on British DVD. If you have the chance, go see it and take all your friends. 
tt0799772; Although "only" around 1 hour and 47 minutes in duration, the pace of this film is so slow that, if you survive watching the whole thing, it feels as though you have sat through Gone With The Wind twice over. I enjoy independent films, basic plots etc, but the makers of this (and its "artistic" plaudits) should realise that two men roaming Spanish fields with minimal conversation (I think the word/name "Sancho" makes up about 20% of the entire vocabulary used) does not constitute a film, nor a useful translation of Cervantes. We learn nothing about the characters, their history, motives, loves, lives... nothing. Another practical curiosity is how Sancho remains so well formed, as neither he nor the Knight seem to eat anything for days on end ! 
tt0799772; How one can translate the best attempt ever made to create a world with language ( I am always surprised at the interest of every sequence, of every word, in Don Quixote)in an empty and pompous movie.To let the characters, who kind of founded modern castillan, speak catalan is the most stupid idea I have ever seen (or heard). Not to have understood that they exist almost only thanks to their dialogs is another one.Just as an example, after the long, long, minutes of silent and obscure introduction, you hear Don Quixote calling Sancho, saying good morning, or something to that effect. Sancho doesn't answer. This is totally out of place: generally speaking, both men are set as equals in dignity and intelligence, and very often the master praises the servant's brains, as the reader does secretly. To destroy this balance is simply destroy the essence of the plot. Don't mention that the original novel is a masterpiece of comic, as this film is one of boredom.Maybe the filmmakers should try an adaptation of Beckett, or film Bhuto theater, if that is their genius. 
tt0128371;  Korean Gangster film that appears to be quite excellent, if confusing. I'll probably have to watch it again to see if still appears excellent when I understand what's going on better :DThe movie loosely follows the life of "Gangster No. 3", who doesn't like to be called a "Gangster" and really hates to be called "No. 3". But there's lots of tangents and side stories so it's hard to really say that there's any one focus to the movie... it's got a very fractured structure (hence the confusion).The movie is strikingly different from most HK Triad movies, and really shows 99% of them up with the intelligence and self-awareness of the script and direction. I guess I don't usually notice just how cliched and unrealistic HK scripts generally are until I see something like this that... well, isn't. Not that cliched and unrealistic is necessarily a bad thing, but you can see why many people are shunning HK movies in favour of Korean flicks these days.There's quite a lot of subtle and dark humour throughout the movie, which doesn't glamorise any of the characters or their lifestyle... they all take themselves terribly seriously, but the movie likes to gently point out how absurd such posturing is.I have to admit I struggled to keep track of which characters were allied to which others, and what the hell they all wanted. It didn't help that about half way through the movie the subtitles suddenly go from very good to absolutely nonsensical. I guess they ran the sub script past a native English speaker after translation by a Korean speaker, but after 50 minutes he had to go and catch a bus or something. I couldn't decide if the quality recovered somewhat towards the end, or it was just that dialogue got more sparse :D There's also quite a bit of written material on screen that goes untranslated throughout.  
tt0128371;  From this film, Korean gangster comedy became the most emergent genre which brought the international fandom to Korean films. The tradition of gangster comedy succeeded to 'Attack the Gas Station', 'My Wife is a Gangster', 'My boss My hero', 'Hi, Dharma', and 'Guns and Talks'.Besides, two great male actors got their stardom by this film. One is Choi Min-sik (Swiri, Failan, Happy End, and Chihwaseon) who concentrated on stage career in those days, and the other is SONG Kang Ho (Swiri, The Foul King, and JSA).This film is very funny and enjoyable satire to Korean society. Most characters are obssessed with something - power, hierarchy, fame, sexual pleasure and property. Sometimes these things are exposed with their vanity. Very Enjoyable film. 
tt0128371; No.3 is supposedly a parody of Korean gangster films. Well, I watched it and I haven't the foggiest where the parody bit comes in. There simply aren't any jokes! Not in the script and not in the action. Which leaves you with only a rubbish gangster flick.The story follows a gangster, whose name I've forgotten, who is promoted to become number two in his gang after he rescues his wounded boss and helps put down an internal coup. Unfortunately his wife is a poet who promptly has an affair with a teacher and everyone keeps calling him number three. In the gang he has a rival, Ashtray, so called because he uses an ashtray to beat people up. There is also a mysterious gangster who is training three idiots to become his gang. Then there is a crime deal, over a hotel, with some Japanese. Meanwhile a new, tough public prosecutor who is more like a gangster than the gangsters is threatening number two/three.All of it makes sense, in a rather loose way, though the constantly changing plot and characters will confuse even those who can remember Korean names and faces. I watched this with three other people and the only way they could track the lead character was his Patrick Swayze- esque hair. The plot is pure sub-Godfather pulp and hugely boring. Sadly as the jokes and parody elements appear to have disappeared (bar one silly sound effect, a man falling in a river, an unintentionally funny fight and two poor references to The Godfather) that is all you get. I didn't laugh once (except a vaguely sobbing noise I made about half way through because of the horror of it all).The action isn't any good either, with the first fight being so poorly lit and frantic that it's nearly impossible to work out what is going on. Someone also saw fit to insert a long, pointless sex scene that just won't end. Indeed the film never ends and when it does it does so in a completely baffling manner that left me at a loss. What happened? One to miss. 
tt0128371;  This film did not turn out quite how I had initially expected, a black comedy - this was a little disappointing, though it was still amusing in parts, so that made up for it. There is more violence than humour, though it becomes a little more slapstick as the film progresses.An amusing and very unexpected conclusion. Though the absurdity of the entire situation throughout is perhaps not appreciated fully, perhaps a little is lost in the translation?  
tt0128371; STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning No.3 is a Korean production, and presents itself as some kind of gangster spoof, when it in fact turns out to be nothing more than your usual edgy, grey Oriental crime film. It looked a bit of a curious offering to start with, and maybe I had looked a bit too closely into the trade descriptions on the title a bit. And to be fair, it's not bad as a typical sort of Western crime flick. But I'm no expert in this sort of field and maybe there's better types of film out there you could be watching. ** 
tt0388679;  I enjoyed "Abgefahren" very much because of itÂ´s good humor and excellent actors. The film is neither about cars nor about testosterone, but there are beautiful cars in it and the girls certainly stir your testosterone! The film is really about men and women and love. The races are perfect metaphors of their conflict-laden relationships. The female lead is a star in Germany and should soon be known internationally. And the soundtrack is one to hear in your car. Intelligent entertainment. Very nice. 
tt0388679;  Okay, we have seen fast and furious films where people chase each other and shoot each other and hate each other. But are our lives really made out of stuff like this? Am I an undercover cop, are You an organized criminal? The movie Abgefahren is such a nice example of a gasoline-driven film, which is, in fact, character-driven. The way the girl and the (cute!) boy heat each other up with their witty dialogs is exhilarating. They seem to be like a cat and a dog, both too proud to admit that they love each other, both wanting to be strong and cool and on the other hand longing to embrace each other. Can You imagine Hepburn sitting in a Dodge and Tracy sitting in a Cobra, arguing about who is the better driver? No? Well, watch Abgefahren!  
tt0388679; Abgefahren may not be high art, but it's a fun little movie. The leads (male and female) are all very appealing, especially Felicitas Woll, who deserves international exposure. The cars are also excellent. Director Jakob SchA¤uffelen does love those hero shots, but in this film it works fine, because it is such a playful story. Sonja Rom's cinematography is, as usual, excellent. On the downside, for the English-speaking audience, the current DVD only has the film in German with no subtitles or other languages. That's too bad, because I think this film could appeal to a wider audience. Abgefahren may not be classic cinema, but sometimes all you want is to be entertained and Abgefahren does the trick. 
tt0388679;  Okay, we have seen fast and furious films where people chase each other and shoot each other and hate each other. But are our lives really made out of stuff like this? Am I an undercover cop, are You an organized criminal? The movie Abgefahren is such a nice example of a gasoline-driven film, which is, in fact, character-driven. The way the girl and the (cute!) boy heat each other up with their witty dialogs is exhilarating. They seem to be like a cat and a dog, both too proud to admit that they love each other, both wanting to be strong and cool and on the other hand longing to embrace each other.

tt0388679; Mia wants to be a rally driver and together with her three girlfriends she enters the cave race. Her opponent Cosmo is interested in her but Mia is already involved with Sherin, her Girlfriend. Since she only drives a Volkswagen ,she bets with Cosmo who adds to the bet ,that he wants to spend a night with her since he drives a better car. Then saying she owes him a kiss he kisses her. Mia agrees. When she wins against Cosmo her victory becomes her defeat when on tape it is discovered that Sherin has sabotaged Cosmos car so Mia can win. There was a lot of resemblance with Chasing Amy, the story that a girl loves a girl first then a boy later. The leading actors were looking good,very nice hear styles and i liked her wardrobe. Sharin was short and nasty and not a very nice person. The movie was made in a manner of American movies from eighties which I liked. A theme, a girl likes a boy and a boy yearns for the girl is something you don't see anymore. I watched the movie with subtitles. Really liked her car when Cosmo painted it in Pink with red hearts all over it. Movie was a slow narrative, there were some jokes but mostly the sexual tension between Mia and Cosmo held my attention. 
tt0388679;  I liked this movie very much because it has not only beautiful girls and cars but it is also very funny. The actors are very good. The images look rich although the film probably was not very expensive. The car races are not very realistic. Nobody uses oldtimers for private races. But I believe that is creative freedom. These cars have personality, just like the people in the movie. I guess female viewers appreciate the romance of this movie. 
tt0388679;  What is this supposed to be? "The Fast and the Furious" in German? The "Story": A bunch of trashy looking girls who behave like men participate in illegal car races. A unrealistic love story is woven into the movie. Are German filmmakers not able to produce anything better than this? I mean IÂ´ve seen worse German comedies, but this one is once again full of extremely banal jokes and clichA©s about men and women. The characters are invented in a rather caricatural manner. The acting is not very good. Especially Rebecca Mosselman alias Liane is pathetic. Once again a German comedy which is not worth watching. If you want to watch a GOOD German movie instead, go and watch "Gegen die Wand". 
tt0279074;  My adolescent son rented this "cop" film "EVENHAND" a couple of days ago, and I reluctantly agreed to watch with him.  He got bored with it after thirty minutes, but I was actually intrigued and decided to give it a try. I was, in effect, blown away!  I didn't realize that there were "cop" films like this.  This was by no means a typical car chase, shootemup -- this was an adult film about troubled people in real situations, dealing with real issues.  It kind of reminded me of the early "NYPD Blues" series before it got weird and convoluted.  I was very impressed with the two actors, and, since I never seen their work before, I thought perhaps they were two police officers who decided to make a movie about their lifes.  That's how realistic it seemed!  When I see actors like this who are unknown, and then I see all the mediocre actors on tv, I have to ask... 
tt0279074;  This is an indie film that is so close to being good, it's frustrating. The performances by Bill Dawes and Bill Sage are engaging and endearing, the cinematography by Tim Orr exquisite, and the songs by Mike Doughty brilliant.  Unfortunately, certain elements of the directing, editing, and score may help explain why it didn't get the theatrical release it could and SHOULD have received.  The first half hour begins slow and foreboding (with a bizarro "Crouching Tiger" instrumental in the background), which would be fine, except for the fact that what slowly and ultimately emerges from this movie is not a mood piece, karate flick, or "meditation" on cop life. What emerges is a character study played to near perfection by the two lead actors.  I hope that they get the recognition they deserve from this film. It is worth just to see what good acting is all about. 
tt0279074;  This is a slow paced but enjoyable little indie film. It's sort of like watching an episode of "Cops", but you get to see what the officers really talk about between calls.Having been a police officer for the past eight years, I must also compliment the film makers and screenwriter for a portrayal of uniformed officers that is as realistic as anything I've seen on film. It is clear to me that the screenwriter, and I'm sure the actors, spent some time researching police officers. The small talk between partners ("You don't like women because of their personality, do you?") was both funny and bang on - I'm sure I had the same conversation myself.There were some flaws that stuck out for me - officer Morning carries both an expandable baton and a straight stick, he brings his mag-light out of the car and puts it on his belt in broad daylight, and he wears his uniform when he goes out drinking at a bar.Nevertheless, the feel was right. The same calls, the same idiots they have to deal with, the same monotony day and night punctuated by a few moments of adrenaline and danger.I also found the acting to be good, especially Bill Sage as Officer Morning. He reminded me of a friend of mine I used to partner with. The soundtrack was also very engaging and appropriate, giving a very bluesy feel like something from Ry Cooder.Not a perfect film, but definitely the best cop film in the past several years. If you like the police stories on Third Watch, you'll like this. 
tt0279074; Joseph Pierson's surprising "EvenHand" comes as a total surprise to this viewer. It seems that even in the Indie circuit, it was not deemed commercial enough to grant this film to be seen by a wider audience. Thanks to the Sundance Channel, we were able to catch with it recently, and frankly, it's much better than some mediocre fare that keeps turning on, even on cable. The screen play is by Mike Jones, who according to IMDb, is his first story for the movies. Mr. Pierson is making his second film after having only co-directed "Cherry", previously.The film has an almost documentary feeling in its exposition. We are somehow confused by the beginning as officer Rob Francis is seen talking to a woman who might have been injured, but we have no clue as to what has happened to her. This, of course, is resolved toward the end of the film, as we are taken to that scene in great detail.The idea of pairing an idealistic cop with one that has been around, and for all accounts, might have dealt with things in his career without the approval of his superiors, is at the center of this story that takes place in the streets of the fictional San Loviso. Officer Ted Morning is a street wise cop who believes in doing things his way. As Morning and Francis begin their partnership we see two different men from different backgrounds with two different attitudes in life.Slowly, both men become one team, as the idealistic Morning starts seeing how things really work and how right his partner is about his approach to the street laws. In fact, Officer Morning is an experienced man in his own community and knows what makes people do the things they do.Bill Sage makes an amazing contribution to the film. His Ted Morning is nothing less than perfection. Mr. Sage also appeared in "Mysterious Skin" in a totally different role and he proves he can do anything. Why is this actor not seen more often and in films that matter, is a mystery. Bill Dawes is another actor that gives an incredible performance as Officer Rob Francis, the man who comes to the San Loviso police force with high ideals and is turned off by what he sees going on instead.If there's a film to watch for great portrayal of real people "EvenHand" is it, thanks to the stylish direction of Joseph Pierson. 
tt0279074; Evenhand is a very impressive accomplishment: a quiet, thoughtful cop film. Its premise is familiar: two very different personalities working to adapt to each other and to the many demands of their jobs as patrolmen. So it's very much a character study, and the two principal actors -- Bill Sage and Bill Dawes -- do an excellent job of realizing their characters. As the film's energy is derived from their characters' different natures, it would have been very easy for each of their performances to become caricatures. They did not. In each, you see a fully-dimensioned person, including echoes of his partner's traits. That's good acting of good writing.I also enjoyed the matter-of-fact style of the film, which reminded me of Victor Nunez's wonderful and under-appreciated Ruby In Paradise. 
tt0279074; Okay, I'm a cop. I'm in Texas, and I work in a suburb of San Antonio, fictionalized as "San Lovisa." I'm also a movie junkie. Naturally, I couldn't resist when I saw, on the Sundance Channel, a movie about Texas cops.The first thing I thought was that some SAPD officer had written a script and managed to get it made, good for him. After watching for a few minutes, waiting for that first cheesy shoot out, or some other over-the-top action sequence, I thought, can it be that someone actually made a cop movie about beat cops without car chases, explosions, shoot outs and all that other stereotypical Hollywood BS? There are so many subtleties of the job that the actors and writer nailed on the head, I was initially convinced that Sage and/or Dawes were or are SAPD officers. Especially Dawes, I could have sworn I'd seen him around. Sage's performance gets a little over the top here and there, but he still nails it for the most part. The dialogue and attitudes and relationship of the two officers and their peers could have been transcribed from any meal break or roll call ( I especially got a kick out of Morning's "fat cop" philosophy). Or how Jessica doesn't recognize Ofc. Francis out of his uniform (find me a cop that's never had that happen!). This is a cop movie about people. About the men (in this case) wearing the blue suit. Think about that. It's not about a gang unit, or some killer posing as a cop, or a crooked cop that needs to be exposed. It's not a detective caper, no international drug smuggling conspiracies here, no sting operations, no surveillance, no high speed pursuits and not really any foot chases. The one officer involved shooting (excepting the end shooting) is not a "shootout," and is realistically portrayed as far as I'm concerned.Bottom line, if you'd like to see a movie that accurately portrays the day in-day out life of a patrolman, without all the far-fetched shoot outs and car chases, see this movie. If you want to see some top notch performances, give it a shot. It's a movie about the job, the relationship between two partners, the dynamic of working patrol and seeing the same old things amongst a series of wholly new challenges, and the difference in attitudes that each officer brings to the table. If the TV show "Cops" showed the 'reality' of the job, it'd look more like this. 
tt0279074;  This is a slice-of-(police)-life drama, that doesn't take the "Hollywood cop movie" route of making the cops crooked. Nope, these cops are human. Bill Sage is great as Officer Morning, the slightly jaded cop taking Officer Francis (Bill Dewes) under his wing. Morning may act like an ass at times, and Francis too saintly, yet you never fail to believe that these two are each doing the right thing in their respective heads. Playing more like a series of vignettes (a la' 'Cops'), this film doesn't have a true plotline until late in the film. But that's just a minor quibble. As far as independent films go, this still remains one of the better ones that I've seen in a while. My Grade: CWhere i Saw it: Sundance Channel 
tt0279074;  This is an amazing film that starts out slow and builds to a very satisfying crescendo because of great chemistry between Bill Dawes and Bill Sage as two cops struggling to get through monotonous patrol duty in a fictional Texas town.  Most of the film's elements work.  Some aspects --- such as the score, the pace of the first act, and some of the supporting cast ---  stand in the way of it being an Indie masterpiece.  It is frustratingly close to being the perfect arthouse film about cops.  As it stands, it is still the ONLY arthouse film about cops that comes to mind.  Bill Sage, who has made a career out of mediocre performances in mediocre films finally impresses in the blustery role of Ted Morning.   And Bill Dawes, with whom whose work I was never familiar, delivers a nuanced, heartbreaking performance as a sensitive police officer trying to find his way.  Their scenes together are the heart and soul of the film -- and the film ended with me wanting to see more of them together and looking forward to buying the DVD (from Hart Sharp) when it comes out.  
tt0279074; I was lucky enough to see Evenhand at the Edinburgh Film Festival and speak to the director Joseph Pierson . Unlike most recent cop films Pierson chose to portray all his officers as regular people so don't expect to see any super cops like Nicholas Farrell or Mel Gibson .Bill Sage reveals (Officer Ted Morning) insights to his character in his first few lines when he tells his new partner Officer Rob Francis (played in an understated style by Bill Dawes) that he hates fat cops .Repeated calls by a battered wife illustrate the frustration that officers feel at dealing with domestic violence . It's not all bleak though - as in real life there's a healthy cynical humour when the officers set up in picnic chairs outside a suspects house . 
tt0279074; What a terrific movie. We have Comcast cable, and the channel guide includes 1 to 4 star ratings (I think I read somewhere that they're Leonard Maltin's ratings). This film got 3 stars, which is fairly unusual, so we checked it out. I'm not a cop, but I have ridden along on a couple of shifts, and this felt very real to me. I enjoyed the rhythm of it, the pace, the juxtapositions, and the acting of the two Bills. The ending surprised me. The tone was light at times, heavy at others, but never false. It's too bad they didn't get into Sundance - at least I'm assuming they didn't, because this is the kind of movie that needs that kind of b.s. validation before distributors will release it theatrically. So, kudos to the Sundance channel at least for picking it up and putting it out there. I hope Joseph Pierson gets another movie together, he's clearly talented. 
tt0498800; It's difficult to comment on this movie being from Spain since it depicts a part of our recent history that is very controversial. Some people may think that a bad or a good review may just depend on the political ideology of the writer. Let me just say that I believe it is hard for anyone to absolutely "turn off" their beliefs and try to judge movie from a completely impartial point of view. Nevertheless we can separate the political elements, and decide if we like them or not, from many other elements that make up the movie. Take an Oliver Stone film like JFK form example. One may have many doubts of what's being said and at the same time admire the way it's being said, even be thrilled by it (there are more radical examples like the propagandistic films that were made for Hitler or Lenin).GAL is a movie about journalists that try to uncover the clandestine actions of a democratic government in their fight against terrorism. I know it sounds exciting. Well, GAL was a huge disappointment as it fails to tell the story in a way that is thrilling or even interesting. I would go as far as to say that it fails to tell the story in a understandable way. That being it's main problem, the actors don't help either. My biggest problem lies with Jordi MollA!, who plays his character like "Torrente" making a supposedly very dark and corrupted character like Amedo (the real name of the character) seem cartoon's. Uniting all these factors, the movie is told in a way that makes nothing seem serious, nothing seem real. In a suspense/thriller that is based on real events, that is a huge problem. 
tt0498800; I wouldn't like to mention past of Spain in the last three decades, but this movie may be classified in an historical movie.Not only historical but it is also a crime movie in which two brave journalists hold roles of police agency and overcome to expose corruptions and inhumanistic crimes of a gang associated with official government.As a spectator I really enjoyed and excited, I was also so glad to see something about reality of Spanish history in the last three decades.It is also make us hopeful to see the victory of democracy supporters against despotism, fascism even racism.I would like to suggest watching it for everyone who like to see reality and crime in movies. 
tt0498800; Natalia Verbeke gives a good performance, showing a driven professional who goes after the truth despite sometimes experiencing personal fear. She has two nice showcase moments in the film where she proves she really got into her character's skin (in the cafeteria before Ariza's deposition and at the paper after a threatening call is received). Jordi Molla, on the other hand, underacts in light of the character he is playing. A military man in such a position would certainly show a great deal more arrogance and violent character, and we all know Molla is capable of showing it after his performance in BLOW. Ana Alvarez is memorable as the submissive girlfriend, but none of the rest of the cast really stand out. There isn't any real character development to make the audience sympathise with any of the main characters beyond mentions in passing that one of the journalists is divorced and the other about to get married.The real problem with this film, however, is that the actors aren't really given much to work with. The basis of the story is explained in a manner approaching docudrama but without sufficient detail to really justify such stilted plot development. The scenes of GAL members doing horrible acts to the tune of American rock music is a teeny bit surreal as clearly it is meant to show GAL was working non-stop committing crimes of all sorts, but the movie doesn't get into the nitty gritty of what they actually did except to show one car bomb and one botched kidnapping. The musical choice makes me wonder if the person who did the soundtrack is at all aware of the music scene in Spain in the 80's and what the characters would likely have been listening to. In any case, the use of flashback at certain parts of the film is supported by the "interview" technique but doesn't add anything in the way of suspense. Rather it gives the film a sloppy and disjointed feel.All in all, the film views like a propaganda film the likes of those shown to troops before wars to get them convinced of how they should feel without explaining too much lest they think for themselves. Frankly, the story this movie covers is a very important one in the history of a country that went from the fascist rule of a dictatorship to democracy without condemning the hierarchy of the previous government for their abuses. Clearly that caused problems in the transition to democracy and arguably those problems are still present today. There are so many historical, political and social issues involved that they cannot easily be treated in 111 minutes. However, that is no excuse for producing a film lacking in focus and development... unless the objective is solely to get the audience worked up.Perhaps a remake will do a better job. Perhaps a subsequent treatment will be worth watching. Aside from Natalia Verbeke's 5 minutes, this one sure is not. 
tt0498800; Natalia's cafeteria scene was good but not extremely good, but her total performance was very good. I thought Molla was exceptional. Want him to receive the Spanish Oscar: Goya. The actresses have stunning beauty. Although I hate Hollywoodian close-ups, I loved to study the faces (men's and women's) here. They are not too short and not too long..."just right" as in Goldilocks. I admire the courage shown here by the newspapermen. I admired the courage shown in LOBO by the "topo" (mole) and others. I hope Melchor Mirailles is gathering material for a third film. (Read between the lines). I enjoyed the scenery taken from a far and especially noticed a waterfront scene with night lights to the left and a huge deposit/container to the right. I hope my note of 8 raises the note of the picture. 
tt0035241; I think it's very easy to see this movie, and with a limited knowledge of fascism & of Franco, to pass it off as utter crap. However, I don't find it particularly useful to do so. The movie itself has many traits that are over the top. Franco uses the character of JosA© as his hero who, because of his nationalism, is reborn or virtually unharmed when sentenced to death by liberals.Yes, it can be corny - but Franco, I think, wasn't the most brilliant of men, and was trying to get a point across as best as he could. It isn't difficult to see how JosA©, the fascist & militarist is portrayed, how Marisol and Isabel and her husband (Luis) are portrayed as Spain's heroes, and how the son Pedro is portrayed as a traitor to his country, at first only interested in money but later "saved" by aiding his family.As a piece that is biased (and what isn't, nowadays) it's a very interesting glimpse into a reaction that was shared by others in a time when Spain was suffering the chaos and the losses of colonies and its position as a world power. Other authors such as Miguel de Unamuno and Angel Ganivet explored the idea of unifying Spain. For Franco, militarist sentiment, extreme nationalism and a hatred of capitalism (which emphasizes individuality and is dangerous for group unity), were all methods of restoring control, order, and a sense of unity.If you want to study one of several reactions to a period of instability, Raza provides a clear outlook. However, if you loathe any references to fascism, don't expect to like a movie based on a novel written by Franco. 
tt0035241; For years I wanted to take a look at this movie, curious by all the mythology that has been built around it. I have laughed a lot with certain reviewer who compares this monumental and infantile piece of trash to Triumph of the Will, as if giving himself some credit as a movie-cultured buff. I have seen Riefenstahl's film two or three times, and I admire her unquestionable talent as a filmmaker. In fact, Olympiad is one of my favourite films for its visual beauty and choreographic editing. Now, about this jewel here... The story is so laughable that not even the illustrious screenwriter Mr Franco -I wonder why he used a phony name in the credits: was he afraid of his own censors perhaps?- would ever believe it. It is curious to see Alfredo Mayo -one of the best Spanish supporting actors of all time- wasting his talents in this filth. But since he made another two Franco propaganda films around that time, I guess he was an acolyte. Fortunately, a few decades later he would work with Carlos Saura, leaving at least a few good, respectable films behind him to be remembered for. 
tt0035241; Not a bad film in the technical features, well shooted and with some good acting, mostly from JosA© Nieto in the role of Pedro Churruca Jr (the bad brother later redeemed by doing treason to his previous comrades and returning to the "right" track).SA!enz de Heredia was a good director, one of the top names of Spanish cinema, and He has much better pictures than this one.Anyway, the script (based on a novel written by Franco) is very partial, and depicts the enemy as bloody thirsty avengers who want to destroy everything that is "good" and "pure" (to be fair the rebel side, commanded by Franco, killed at least as much people as the other - and possibly more - during the war, and when the war was over, the dictatorship created by Franco continued to killing people from the prisons for another ten years! So when you see Raza try to put things in their right terms. This is a movie made from the winner's point of view, so you better don't take the political side too seriously if you want to understand the real situation of Spain in the last years of the 19th century and the first forty years of the 20th. 
tt0035241;  Reading some of the comments about this truly awful and pathetic piece of fascist apology, I was considerably shocked.'Raza', written by the dictator Franco himself, is nearly a Freudian reconstruction of the Franco family history mixed with a really difficult to stand glorification of the fascist, falangist version, symbolism. Nevertheless, one has to admit that the screenplay has splendid, unintentionated, humor moments (the comments about the almogaveres are really one of those moments to be present in any compilation  of absurdities).Even recognizing that Saenz de Heredia was a good director, in the technical way of speaking, he was not Leni Riefenstahl. More than sixty years later this film just can be look as an interesting piece of archelogy. 
tt0035241;  Very interesting work to know the point of view of spanish national ideology. Franco supposedly wrote the script of this mediocre film. Indispensable to understand certain things of the Spanish Civil War.
tt0035241; The film was written by Franco a military dictator who's "crusade" left 2 million deaths. It is his equivalent of Mein Kampf and filmed as fascist propagandaWhen you watch this movie, or read other users comments, please bear in mind the true history of the Spanish civil war.The 30's started with the end of the 7 year military dictatorship by Primo de Rivera who failed to solve the numerous social and economic problems. The king, Alfonso VII, left on voluntary exile as he recognized the lack of support from the majority of the Spanish society.What followed was the reinstatement of the Spanish democracy, bear in mind the first Spanish constitution was written in 1812. The initial elections where won by the left, however after less than 2 years the various problems led to elections being called again and a coalition of right wing parties won the majority but it was just as unsuccessful as the left wing government.The republic, as the Spanish democracy was called, tried to tackle the different social and economic problems, among which we have the dominance of the countryside by landlords and the army overburdened by an excess of officers. The Catholic church was also blamed for preaching conservative thought at a time when deep reforms where necessary. The republic, being secular, endeavored to curtail the power of the church in government areas, particularly public education and cut on subsidies.They were turbulent times. There was a military upraising that failed and was later followed by a general strike and workers revolt that failed too. In the meantime a strong Anarquist movement hand grown in industrial Barcelona. The communist where a political minority, the left being mainly represented by the Socialist party. On the other side of the political spectrum the Spanish Falange, akin to the Nazi party, was a minority.The military organized another coup, this time with the involvement of the highest generals and the uprising was immediately backed by the Falange, the landowners, the church and conservatives. However the upraising failed in the main cities and industrial areas, it succeeded only in conservative rural areas. This was mainly due to the government giving weapons to labour unions and left wing parties who were organized and quick to respond to the military coup. In Barcelona the Anarquists used their new power to carry out their political agenda, an Anarquist revolution. The communist party surprised everyone by how well organized and pragmatic they were, forming one of the few truly effective fighting forces.In the meantime, Franco, with the support of the Italian and German fascist leaders who sent troops, equipment and in particular planes, managed to get the trained and experience north African troops from Morocco, moors included, into the peninsula, even though the Navy remained loyal to the Republic.Great Britain however, in their appeasement policy towards Hitler, did not support the republic as it would mean fighting Hitler, and convinced France to follow suit and established an embargo. The USA washed its hands too, but did not stop Texaco from supplying Franco with all the necessary oil, including that which had been paid by the republic. Only Communist Russia agreed to support the republic, in particular by selling arms and sending training instructors. This support from Russia and the exemplary discipline of the communist led many to join them and they grew significantly during the civil war to became an important party, though the left wing conservatives where still the majority.In the meantime up to 150.000 people from all over the world came to fight fascism in Spain in what was later considered a prelude to the Second world war. The Lincon brigade was mainly US citizens, but there was also the Garibaldi (Italians) and a German brigade which surprised many who where used to being dive bombed by the Luftwafe, remember Picasso's masterpiece "el Guernica". The initial chaos had seen citizens taking arms and different labour unions being responsible for the defense as the remaining army was not trusted much. However, with time the Republic managed to organize a new army and take back control from the unions. The Anarquists in Barcelona resisted, as it would be the end of their revolution and for a few weeks fighting went on in Barcelona.The republic did not control enough rural areas to feed the population, and the economic embargo led to extreme food rationing and the lack of arms supplies and experienced troops meant its army was not effective enough to fight back and only managed to slowdown the revolt and successfully defend Madrid, which never fell.Franco, who had come to power after the accidental death of the coup leaders and the success of its African troops, had an effective combat force and arms supply. Inch by inch they gained control of the country in a 3 year civil war that left 2 million dead.The war was very bloody, at a time where people thought ideologies could solve the worlds problems. Though Great Britain gained mining rights as a result of their lack of support to the Republic, they and France would pay dearly when a couple of years later Hitler changed his attention to them, and it was only thanks to the 20 million dead Russians that he was defeated.In my opinion, though Franco turned out to be a benevolent dictator, he did not outdo all the damaged done by the war, and only after his death, with a democracy, has Spain realized its true economic and social potential.For more information please go to wikipedia. 
tt0035241;  a great work by the spanish Saenz de Heredia.a truly history about spanish civil war ( a fight against communism). Franco wrote the screenplay . The picture is in the style of "They died with their boots on"fernando alonso barahonaautor de "BiografA­a del cine espaA±ol" , "AntropologA­a del cine " 
tt0035241;  This film has been mercilessly and unfairly ignored because of their ideological content and its historical and cinematographic values have been scandalously overlooked or dismissed. I think that its quality is excellent (take, for example, the scene of the murder of the priests on the beach, with that overwhelming view of the corpses softly caressed by the sea waves) and that (like in most of the films about the Civil War shot in Spain during the post-war years) what you see in it is enormously mild in comparison with all that really happened during that nefarious political period we know as the Second Spanish Republic. SA!enz De Heredia (one of the greatest and most shamefully under-under-under-underrated film directors in cinema history) proved once more that he was perfectly capable of telling a story as it must be told, and besides he surrounded himself with some of the best actors of the time, such as the wonderful Alfredo Mayo (the scene of his failed "shooting" is simply memorable), the beautiful and splendid Blanca De Silos, the equally good JosA© Nieto, RaAol Cancio and the rest, but, most of all, IÂ´d like to dedicate a special mention to that fabulous, gorgeous, intelligent, multi-faceted and talented woman that was the late Ana Mariscal (actress, writer, director and probably the sexiest spot-by-the-mouth artiste that there has ever been apart from Anne Francis), whose real-life brother, Luis Arroyo, plays the role of Jaime Churruca, the young murdered priest. Both the original book (written by Generalissimo Franco with the pseudonymous Jaime De Andrade) and the movie are small but truthful and REAL pieces of history and their quality is first-rate. DonÂ´t let yourself influence by political or ideological prejudices: just see it and learn the truth, and keep on learning it afterwards. I beg you! 
tt0035241; First of all, I want to clear up something: I love Britain. I love the British people. In many aspects, I feel British. (You could put the music from "West Side Story" to this affirmation: "I feel British, oh so British..."). IÂ´m a citizen of the world. But I cannot help feeling indignant when someone tries to pull my leg, as some British character like pseudo-historian Paul Preston or so is attempting to do.I donÂ´t want to be boring, but I must insist about my age. I was born in 1919, so I DO know the era that "Raza" deals with. Everything that the film says is true, although it is presented in a very mild and benevolent way. The pursuit against the Catholic church is true. The hate of militiamen towards priests, monks, nuns and Catholic people in general is true. The shootings in the red zone (and the word "red" is not offensive - the left-wingers called themselves that way) are true. (For a better information, I recommend the books written about the subject by the former member of the GRAPO PA­o Moa.) Believe me, I DO KNOW SOMETHING.I want to set the record straight: I donÂ´t like to speak badly about ANYONE, but the Truth is my best friend and I must be faithful to it. The thing is that we are talking about a film. IÂ´m completely against Communism and that doesnÂ´t prevent me from liking "Potemkin". IÂ´m not a Nazi, but I like "Triumph Of The Will". And "Potemkin", judging by what I have read about the subject, is very inaccurate from a historical point of view, "Raza" isnÂ´t. It is a no-nonsense picture. But most of all itÂ´s a very good movie: the actors are wonderful (particularly Ana Mariscal - what a woman!), the direction is impeccable and the semi-documentary tone of the whole work is successful. IÂ´ll say it again: the assassination of the monks on the beach is among the best cinematic scenes I have ever seen, and I cry every time I watch it. Because, unfortunately, that was only (sorry to say) too true. The fact that IÂ´m a certain age doesnÂ´t make me dodder or drivel, thank God.Other films, like "La Caza", "Furtivos" or "El EspA­ritu De La Colmena", have tried to tell a different story, but the degree of success is uneasy: "La Caza" (one of whose leading actors, by the way, is the great Alfredo Mayo, the protagonist of "Raza") is a good film (maybe the best film of Carlos Saura, which is not saying much), but itÂ´s not a film about the war, but rather about the aftermath of the war, and it doesnÂ´t reflect at all a reality, those facts didnÂ´t exist in the 60s (or, at least, they were not a general attitude). And as for "Furtivos" or "El EspA­ritu De La Colmena", they also depict a society later than the war (not the war itself, and still less the pre-war) and, for all their fame and prizes, they are (from a strictly cinematographic and non-political point of view) small pieces of blatant rubbish.Before I say goodbye, I must stress something: hate is not a good advisor. And profanities and obscene language are no good, especially when headed for someone who is dead and therefore cannot defend himself. Please, letÂ´s calm down a little bit. May people read good books and learn the truth. I hope that, as in Charles LaughtonÂ´s great film "Night Of The Hunter", love ends up defeating hate. God bless you. 
tt0035241;  Have you ever seen a Commmunist movie? Have you ever seen a Nazi movie? If you say "yes" for one of this questions, then you know what you will watch if you rent or buy "RAZA". The movie was directed by the impersonal director of the FrancoÂ´s fascist and dictatorial regime Sainz de Heredia, who was cousin of one of the most important ideological men of the only legal party in those times: Jose Antonio Primo de Rivera. The movie is glorify tale about military men against democratic men in Spanish Civil War times. If you donÂ´t know the result of that war: Franco won the war with HitlerÂ´s help, and wrote this movie in 1940 when he was Dictator in chief in Spain. The movie is so bad, that you laugh a lot in some scenes: The Father of the protagonists speaking about death in battlefield: "ItÂ´s a honor!! ItÂ´s wonderful die for your country!!". The Father, later, dies fighting against United States of America... and dies with a big smile in his face. All a movie of fascist glorification: The democratics are portrayed like bad people, that kill the priests, and steals the bread...I say you once more time... DONÂ´T SEE THIS BAD MOVIE!!! YOU COULD BECAME A NAZI AFTER THAT... OR DIE OF LAUGHING ATTACK!! 
tt0075852;  This is probably the best example of a 70's Italian crime movie, though not the "best" movie of the genre (does that make sense?).  It has, besides Saxon, an entirely Italian cast but most of them are pretty recognizable regulars in very amusing roles.  Maurizio Merli is best as the role he was born to play, that of yet another ticked off Police commissioner.  His very charismatic, yet level-headed performance is the one thing that keeps this movie moving along so well, and it is notable that of Lenzi's crime movies, this is probably the one that entrusts Merli with the most screentime (besides FROM CORLEONE TO BROOKLYN - though that is not so much a crime movie).It's a pretty sloppily-shot, and haphazardly edited film (probably because most of Lenzi's films from this time were made with little money and over the span of 2-3 weeks), but has some very memorable shots (Merli charging across the foot-bridge, Merli pulling a bandage off of his newly healed arm, etc.) and a killer soundtrack by Franco Micalizzi (probably his best one).  What's not to like about poorly-dubbed Italians smacking each other, breaking chairs over each-other's heads, shooting people in hospital beds, and stealing women's cars?  The only weaknesses in this film are the fact that the heist sequence is far too long and drawn out, and the ending shootout is too quick and confusing (centering only on Milian vs. Merli when there is a whole gang war going on).  Otherwise, a solid and action-packed film.  It should also be noted that this probably has the most swearing of any 70's Italian movie, at least in the English version, making it the polar opposite of THE BIG RACKET.  
tt0075852; The Cynic, The Rat and The Fist clearly takes influence regarding it's central theme from the Sergio Leone masterpiece 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly', and here we follow the fortunes of three strong male characters as their lives intertwine in the name of crime. Director Umberto Lenzi plied his trade in a number of Italy's most popular genres, and his resume includes the likes of zombies, cannibals and Giallo, but the only field he's a master in is the Dirty Harry inspired sub-genre, 'Polizia'. This is only my third Lenzi crime flick, but I wouldn't be surprised to find that it's one of the best he ever made, as the masterpiece 'Almost Human' only just edges it out. Umberto Lenzi packs his film with all the things you'd expect from the crime genre, with things such as shootouts, car chases and sadism featuring strongly. The actual plot is a little convoluted, and follows Italian mob boss 'The Chinaman', as he hooks up with New York crime lord Frank Di Maggio. The cop looking to take the pair of them down is Leonardo Tanzi, a man not afraid to break the law in order to bring in his man.Exactly which of the title monikers apply to which of the three characters is never really explained, although personally, I wager that Tomas Milian's Chinaman is 'The Cynic', John Saxon's mob boss is 'The Rat' and Maurizio Merli violent copper is the aptly named 'The Fist'. One of the film's strongest elements is undoubtedly the cast list, as the central trio of characters are brought to life by three of cult cinema's best actors. Tomas Milian certainly knows his way around a sadistic part, while the underrated (and sadly here underused) John Saxon's resume speaks for itself. Maurizio Merli is perhaps the least accredited member of the cast, but lead roles in this and Lenzi's Violent Naples certainly shows that the man can play the gritty copper. The plot flows very well, and Lenzi's direction continually impresses. It can be a little hard to follow at times, but there's always enough shooting and murders to keep genre fans happy. The ending is a major strongpoint too, as Lenzi spends the entire film building up to a showdown, and when it hits, it doesn't disappoint. Overall, this is a first class example of the Italian crime thriller and comes highly recommended. 
tt0075852; With great works in a variety of genres, such as Gialli, Poliziotteschi and Cannibal Flicks, Umberto Lenzi is doubtlessly one of the most productive and versatile directors in Italian Exploitation/Cult-Cinema. And, along with Fernando Di Leo, he is arguably the ultimate master of the Italian crime-genre. Though maybe just not quite as great (and neither quite as brutal and uncompromising) as its predecessor "Roma A Mano Armata" ("Rome Armed To The Teeth", 1976) or the masterpiece "Milano Odia: La Polizia Non PuA2 Sparare" ("Almost Human", 1974), "Il Cinico, L'Infame, Il Violento" aka. "The Cynic, The Rat And The Fist" of 1977 is yet another gritty and great Poliziottesco by Lenzi. Its title doubtlessly being derived from Sergio Leone's 1966 masterpiece "Il Buono, Il Brutto, Il Cattivo" (better known as "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly", and arguably the greatest Western ever made), "The Cynic, the Rat and the Fist" stars three iconic actors in Italian genre-cinema, Maurizio Merli, Tomas Milian and John Saxon. This is a sequel to Lenzi's own "Roma A Mano Armata", in which Maurizio Merli reprises his role of the super-tough and uncompromising Inspector Leonardo Tanzi. Tanzi is a supremely bad-ass, unorthodox Rome cop who hates criminals as he hates crime and whose methods make Dirty Harry seem tame in comparison. Tomas Milian is back with greatness, in a different villain-role than that he played in the predecessor. Leonardo Tanzi, who has retired from the police in this one and yet keeps chasing down (and beating up) criminals is targeted by Luigi 'Er Cinese' Maietto ("Tomas Milian") a brutal and unscrupulous criminal whom he helped bring to justice and who has just been released from prison. After an attempt on his life, Tanzi fakes his own death, which gives him the opportunity to secretly carry on with his investigations. 'Er Cinese', in the meantime, has founded an alliance with the Italian-American mob boss Frank Di Maggio (John Saxon), a man who likes to feed enemies to his dogs... It isn't explained which titular attribute refers to whom of the characters. Even so, Merli is doubtlessly 'the Fist' ('Il Violento'), and it's safe to assume that Milian is 'the Cynic', which would make Saxon 'The Rat' ('L'infame'/the infamous). All three leading men are great as always. Merli is great in his typical leading role of the unorthodox and super-tough copper and John Saxon shines as the slick Mafia Don, however, one might still say that the number one performance in this film comes from Tomas Milian, who is once again downright brilliant in the role of another cynical and sadistic thug. The supporting cast includes many regulars of Italian genre-cinema, such as Guido Alberti or Bruno Corazzari. The film is action-packed, full of violent shootouts, chases and sequences of genre-typical brutality. As Lenzi's other Poliziotteschi, the film is accompanied by a great score, this one being composed by Franco Micalizzi, who also did the scores for "Roma A Mano Armata" and "Napoli Violenta". Even this does not quite reach the level of "Milano Odia" and "Roma A Mano Armata", in my opinion, it is still a gritty, violent, immensely entertaining and simply great Crime offering by Umberto Lenzi, carried by loads of action, three sublime leading men and Lenzi's magnificent direction. Not to be missed by lovers of cinematic bad-assery! 
tt0075852; After watching a bunch of less than stellar Poliziotteschi in recent months, I am happy to report that this one lived up to just about every positive review I've read. With a cast that includes Maurizio Merli (doing less "posing" than in some of his other films), Tomas Milian, John Saxon, and a bunch of other familiar faces, Umberto Lenzi's The Cynic, the Rat & the Fist gets off to a fast start and keeps going at a good pace through most of the film's runtime. Nice action, violence, direction, and a catchy score (by Franco Micalizzi) also add to the enjoyment. Of all the great moments in the film, the sparring scenes between Milian and Saxon are easily my favorites.My only real complaint comes at the films climax. It's over too quickly. There's a nice setup for the film's finale, but it's over before you know it. An ending that didn't feel so rushed would have made this one a real standout in the genre. 
tt0075852; This is one of the better poliziotteschi I've seen - written by Lenzi with two other Euro-Cult stalwarts, Ernesto Gastaldi and Dardano Sacchetti - and also, perhaps, the quintessential Maurizio Merli film (not that this, in itself, is a guarantee of quality!).From the title, one presumes that this was intended to be THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY (1966) of crime films - although, here, the shifty alliance is made between two baddies (Tomas Milian - dubbed "The Chinaman", for some reason a favorite nickname in films from this subgenre! - and John Saxon). Again, having just watched COP IN BLUE JEANS (1976) the previous day, I couldn't help noticing just how many of these films open with a robbery sequence, likewise, the leading man's girlfriend generally emanates from the wrong side of the tracks and is victimized for aiding our hero during the course of the film! As is to be expected, the film's pace never lets up by providing a steady quota of highly proficient action scenes - culminating in a heist committed at one of Saxon's offices by Milian's thugs(!) and which also involves Merli and "The Professor", an elderly pint-sized expert in gadgetry, in the elaborate diffusion of the building's security system. Still, characterization is not entirely neglected: Merli is obsessed with catching Milian (even if the two only come face to face at the climax) and, feigning his own death, works undercover to this end but remains in contact with his chief, Milian is a small-time hood with ambitions of taking over the territory of American mobster Saxon, the latter, then, is the typical gangster - wealthy, ruthless (with a penchant of leaving traitors at the mercy of his enormous hounds!) and apparently omnipotent. The scenes in which the villainous duo clash - each with his own agenda which sees no place in the scheme of things for the other! - constitute some of the film's highlights, Franco Micalizzi's score is also notable.Even if the film's in no way a spoof as COP IN BLUE JEANS had been, its script features a comparable surfeit of hard-boiled dialogue which is so over-the-top as to be quite funny - extending even to the notes of condolences passed on amongst the criminals as a means of heralding someone's death sentence! 
tt0075852; This title is available on the Mafia Kingpin Collection from the great Pop Flix label. It is a superb wide screen print with expertly dubbed English voices. John Saxon has his own voice which adds to the enjoyment of the piece. The music is also first rate. The action is non-stop and the supporting cast excellent. Superb location filming add to the enjoyment.The Pop Flix DVD also includes: Mister Scarface (Fullscreen), (Jack Palance) The Cop In Blue Jeans (Fullscreen) (Jack Palance), Rome Armed To The Teeth (Widescreen) (Arthur Kennedy, Maurizio Merli) Violent Naples (Widescreen) (Maurizio Merli, John Saxon, Barry Sullivan) 
tt0075852;  THE CYNIC, THE RAT AND THE FIST is an excellent Italian police film directed by genre meister Umberto Lenzi. Despite his cannibal movies notority this is what Lenzi is really best at. Stylish, well scripted, with catchy scores and starring tough guys like Tomas Milian, Maurizio Merli, John Saxon, Henry Silva and other genre vets his police films always offer great entertainment. The plot (as in his other films) isn't very important, but has basically something to do with tough cop Merli hunting down and beating up criminals, while dodging counterattacks from gangsters Milian and Saxon.  
tt0075852; Fast moving, varied and colourful, this is a violent, although not particularly bloody tale of gang against gang and police against gangs with renegade cop doing all the work. Maurizio Merli is that ex-cop here, looking much like Franco Nero and doing almost as well. John Saxon is fine as one gang leader and Thomas Milian (barely recognisable as the other). There is some debate as to who takes which part of the title but for my money Saxon is the 'cynic', Milian the 'rat' with Merli undoubtedly the 'fist', but see the movie and make up your own mind. Some nice set pieces and some humour also in the mix and if there is less emphasis on the girls in this one there is at least one most memorable and violent scene. 
tt0075852; My estimation of Umberto Lenzi has risen over the years. Maybe I shouldn't have started with his late-era movies like House of Lost Souls etc, but during the seventies he was one of the great. This is a perfect example of what I'm talking about.If there's a bad Italian crime movie, I haven't seen it. This one has Maurizio Merli as a cop driven to fake his death as Tomas Milian gets out of jail and swear revenge. You seen these films, right? I don't have to explain any more (gunfights, fistfights, car chases, showdowns).These films, above all Italian genre movies, make me feel like a little kid again, from the music, to the style, to John Saxon's moustache, you just can't beat them. This is benefits from having Merli, Saxon, and especially Milian trying to out act each other.The Cynic, The Rat and The Fist makes me want to go out, by a kipper tie and flared pastel suit, grow a moustache, grab a bottle of J&B, light up a Malboro, slip the safety of a sub-machine gun and jump onto a moped with a hooker with a heart of gold (who isn't averse to a friendly smack in the chops if she gets lippy).Get it now - you can get box sets of these from the US for pennies. 
tt0075852; Gonzoid Euro-crime with the appealing triumvirate of Merli, Milian and Saxon, with so much scene chewing testosterone on display it's a blessed wonder that any celluloid remained for the final print. Saxon plays the boorish crim, Frank Di Maggio with charismatic muscularity, and there really can be only one avenging, fists first, thug-baiting copper up to the task of carving a crimson swathe of justice through the iniquitous backstreets of Rome, and that man is the icon of hep-cat poliziotto cool, an uber geezer with a mustache fashioned out of living granite, ladies and germsÂ give it up for, Maurizio Merli, the protean arch nemesis to douchebags, young and old, large, or small, bearded, or shaved. You cross that line on Merli's watch and you go home in a blood spattered, zip lock tuxedo! The swarthy, and perpetually balding, Saxon bites off more than he can chew, and ends up choking on a fist-sized, broken-jawed mound of Maurizio Merli! 'The cynic, the rat & the fist' isn't the greatest Merli/Lenzi pairing, but it's damn close, cupcake! And that means one thingÂ GOOD TIMES! 
tt1420543; As a non-Pole I knew nothing about General Nil (the code name of Emil Fieldorf, a general in the Polish "Home Army" resistance). This film shows a stark, bleak vision of the life and choices which was faced by the men and women who fought bravely for their country against both the Nazis and the Soviets, having been betrayed by their so-called Allies. Men who fought for a free Poland (it had only been re-established in 1918 after over 120 years being wiped off the map)then had to face the prospect of life under a Soviet banner or death (exile was also an option).The film shows the bleak existence many ordinary Poles faced, as well as the danger anyone faced for saying they had been involved in AK (Home Army) activities, and the merciless power of the Soviet system, which the Allied powers had abandoned them to.The performances are powerful and commanding. The images of ordinary civilians (Nil's wife and daughter) being abused by the communist system, the betrayal of old ideals and old comrades, the atmosphere of terror which the new Soviet powers sought to instill are vividly portrayed.For those who think WW2 starts and ends with Sir John Mills or John Wayne will be shocked and disgusted at what went on afterwards.This film is superb. NO glorified battles or last stands, just the portrayal of courage and dignity in the face of squalid betrayal and brutality. 
tt1420543; A movie about a "HERO,' proclaimed the advertsÂ but, when we hear this word, lots of us have different interpretations. Who is, as a matter of fact, a hero nowadays, in our civilized world? Is it someone capable of outstanding deeds or is it simply someone faithful to his own values, his dreams till the very last breath? Someone ready to look into the eyes of one's enemy with dignity and pride, metaphorically someone stones willingly shout about if people do not want to speak about? This movie made recently by Ryszard Bugajski clearly presents the life of such a hero, the man who said radical NO to the two monstrous powers of tyranny that shook Poland in the twentieth century, Emil Fieldorf (1895-1953) known as General Nil.Soon after the biopic POPIELUSZKO which told us a story of a Priest who coped with communist regime in the late 1970s and the early 1980s till his very martyrdom, this movie tells us a story of a General who coped with outrageous accusations and fury of Stalin's servants till his very execution. Although the two films occur to discuss similar themes, they appear to differ considerably. While the former one depicted the spiritual freedom of Popieluszko universally known, the latter one depicts psychological heroism of Fieldorf, though a brave patriot during Nazi monstrosity, deliberately ignored for years of communist oppression. But when I decided to see this film, I asked myself a significant question: "who was, in fact, Fieldorf known under the name of Walenty Gdanicki?" Someone who merely dared say NO to the promising offers, delicious cognacs, good coffee and Soviet smiles of People's Republic's comrades? Or someone more than thatÂ someone who really broke them and made them fear in long lasting ignorance and silence? That is what the film memorably supplies you with - a true insight into the specific phenomenon of this man and into the universal phenomenon of a man faithful to his ideals. Starting with some flashbacks of WWII years and Fieldorf's return from Ural Mountains, the movie faithfully depicts Fieldorf's story of life - later life, his struggles, his fears, his ideals. But, it is not only the story why I find this movie a valuable work.GENERAL NIL is a perfect film for viewers who appreciate something thought provoking. You are simply filled with thrill and reflections throughout. Why? Thanks to clever script, unpredictable action, intense emotions and lots of memorable moments, or, better said, very accurate presentation of the times. To the major moments, I would recall communist tortures, horror of politics of the time, manipulation in courts and the final moments filled with dignity, power and clarity of emotions. The intense atmosphere encountered in the movie goes with marvelous performances. Olgierd Lukaszewicz does a fine job in the lead helping the viewer get into the mind of the main character, portraying courage, dignity, upright emotions on the one hand, and, weakness and typical human fear on the other hand. The supporting cast appear to be the right depiction of the Poles, not the distorted satire on the nation like in many movies of recent years but a just portrayal of the people. The supporting cast give fine performances, including Magdalena Emilianowicz as Krystyna, Fieldorf's wife, Bronislaw Wroclawski as procurator Wajsblech and Wenanty Nosul as Boleslaw Bierut.The depiction of communist regime is another factor why I find this film worth watching. What I like about the movie is the fact it goes deeper into human heart. It does not merely present the wretchedness of communists as some past features but rather depicts the state of humans in service of wickedness, of cruelty, manipulation, corruption and awful indifference to tragedy and injustice. So to say, the world that is reigned like the Nazism by a sole rule of extermination: whoever is not with us is against us! The scene of shooting the young boy with cold blood clearly resembles that. The communists are the people for whom the spiritual becomes absurd, yet the ones who get touched by the ridiculous smiles of upper comrades naively believing in the power of Soviet ideals. So to say, everyone needs their ideals that fit their intellect. The symbolic number of stairs are rather what they aim to see than there truly are: manipulation of facts, believing in the nonsense of "half-truth." Consequently, they are the ones who create the world of cruelty and misery, who bring up the children according to propaganda but, at the same time, get so tired of them. Finally, they are those who tremble at the face of true courage and upright heart since there is only room for selfish greed and secret connections.Summing it up, I don't attempt to theorize or exaggerate for Emil Fieldorf would not like it as it is nicely conveyed in the memorable conversation with a Jew in prison. I seriously tell you as a Pole and as a movie buff: GENERAL NIL is worth watching. If you are fed up with pompous script, fake ideals, predictable action and clichA©s, it is a film for you, powerful 2 hours that will make you breathless in your seat, a memorable film about a general who was deprived of justice, rights, even funeral by politically correct comrades, yet a heroic patriot whose name may be heard again after years of secretly buried truth. 9/10 
tt1420543; It is true that in recent times some outstanding Polish films about war have been made.However,it would not be advisable to suggest that their filming has started a new trend of films about war.This is the case with films made by two giant figures of Polish cinema Mr.Andrzej Wajda and Mr.Ryszard Bugajski.It is just a mere coincidence that they have made "Katyn" and "General Nil" at a time when war films are not so much a trend neither in Polish cinema nor in European cinema.General Nil is an important film for people of all nations.This is because there is hardly any country in the world which has not been touched by ghastly horrors of war.Young people all over the world could well become the biggest beneficiaries of pertinent ideas related to humanism and individual freedom as shown in "General Nil" as they are the ones who have little or no idea about sacrifices made by people like General Nil in the past to get freedom.Mr.Bugajski has made a wonderful film which would easily serve as a good lesson about Polish history.Those who have seen Mr.Bugajski's masterpiece Przesluchanie (The Interrogation) starring great Polish cinema actress Ms.Krystyna Janda will be pleased with "General Nil" as both these films remarkably depict turbulent times witnessed by innocent Polish people at hands of despicable communist party men who has no qualms about inflicting heart rending atrocities.Film critic Lalit Rao spoke at length with Mr.Ryszard Bugaski during 14th International Film Festival of Kerala where "General Nil" was screened to packed houses. 
tt1420543; Emil August Fieldorf is one of the most inspirational combat heroes of World War II. He fought against both the Nazis and the Soviets and planned the 1944 execution of SS Police Leader Franz Kutschera. Fieldorf's life and his death defy comfortable narratives, though, and his story is largely forgotten."General Nil" is a 2009 film based on Fieldorf. "General Nil" is graced with unimpeachable production values, an unforgettable, heartbreaking and bracing central performance by Olgierd Lukaszewicz, and a story that needs to be told. Right now, though, it is almost unknown, and available in limited DVD versions.I sat down to watch this movie knowing what hardcore film fans don't want to know: the entire plot, and ending, of the movie. And I knew it would be an unhappy ending. What's amazing about "General Nil" is that director Ryszard Bugajski managed to make a movie-movie, a genuinely Â<U+0096> I have to say this -- entertaining and aesthetically pleasing film about the worst crimes humanity has committed, and the victims of the worst monsters.I finished this film feeling not at all depressed or crushed as I expected, but with the feeling of satisfaction that a masterful film can create in its viewers. In this, "General Nil" is comparable to "A Man for All Seasons." Paul Scofield plays St. Thomas More, a main character every viewer knows is going to die, crushed to death by historical conflicts beyond his control. Even so, it's a great film, and one you love having watched after you've finished."General Nil" offers the eye candy film fans demand: aesthetically composed, interesting images: a train chugging off to the snowy wastes of Siberia, vintage 1940s and 1950s clothing, hairstyles and automobiles, on-location architecture and interiors. It also offers intrigue and insights into real historical events of world historical importance: young and gorgeous Polish Home Army, or Armia Krajowa soldiers carry out the assassination of a Nazi villain, Poles debate their fate as they await aid from their allies, the United States and Great Britain.In spite of its epic sweep, the film offers the intimate moments we go to movies to see. Fieldorf, back from Siberia, finds a 78 rpm record that somehow survived the war. He puts it on an old victrola, and reminds his wife of an easier, luckier night from their past, when they were able to dance and flirt and not worry about tomorrow. Then, these two wrinkled, wounded people Â<U+0096> wounded inside and out Â<U+0096> force their bodies through romantic dance movies. In this attempt at romance, and even love, in spite of all they have been through, Fieldorf and his wife are as brave as any two characters could be.Fieldorf is seen in a vile Soviet dungeon alongside other Home Army veterans Â<U+0096> and a notorious Nazi. It was the Soviet's perverse plan to equate Polish Home Army veterans with Nazis: of course: up is down, wrong is right, and the Party decides all. Even in that setting, pregnant with historical significance, the director does not forget to create a small, human moment. Fieldorf's response to the Nazi, once on his hit list, now his fellow prisoner, results in one of the film's most touching and challenging scenes."General Nil's" Soviets are appropriately reptilian, including Helen Wolinska Brus, the Stalinist judge who condemned Fieldorf to death, and Jozef Rozanski, a torturer who manages to appear ready for a cocktail party set to Cole Porter tunes after a workday of blowing out the brains of heroic Home Army veterans. Rozanski was a real person, and a real torturer, having tortured some of the finest human beings who ever lived, including Witold Pilecki.Fieldorf is not depicted as perfect. He doesn't know how to do the right thing for his wife and children, and it's not clear, in any case, what the right thing might be. When approached by a hot blooded young Home Army veteran who wants to continue the war they'd fought against the Nazis, only now against the Soviets, Fieldorf raises his hand to slap the younger man's face, but, when he makes contact, all he can do is caress the younger man, and then walk away, silent, shoulders slumped, his posture an acknowledgement of Poland's doomed fate after being betrayed by her American allies, the United States and Great Britan, at Yalta.I thought I'd be biting the bullet throughout this film, thought it would be like a visit to the dentist Â<U+0096> painful but good for you, something you're glad when it's over.In fact the film was gripping and rewarding to watch, and Â  did I say that there is an unhappy ending? Maybe Â  and maybe not. Fieldorf was a man, a real man, and, in this, he was utterly victorious. Spending two hours with him was my good fortune.PS: My book, "Bieganski" mentions Helen Wolinska Brus, the Soviet judge who condemned Fieldorf to death. Poland asked England to extradite her in order that she might face justice for her crime. She never did. She said she refused to return to Poland, "the country of Auschwitz." "Bieganski" provides the context necessary to understand her comment. And one more PS: I owe great thanks to my superb hostess in Poland, Malgorzata, without whom I would have remained unaware of the existence of this not-to-be-missed film. 
tt0299014;  Picking up these low-budget indie flicks is a little like playing Russian Roulette, except that it seems this way there are more chances to shoot yourself in the head. So few times do I actually find something good. 'Lucky' almost made it. It is a twisted look at the inner workings of a writer's mind, manifested in a dog that has come back from the dead. I did laugh a couple of times, but more often than not I found myself grimacing - almost sickened by this guy Mudd. It is a clever film, well done, but it sort of misses its mark, I think, because it is a lot darker than one would think a movie about a talking dog would be. Plus the philosophical ramblings of Mudd, whenever he got off on his tangents, were very hard to follow - although I realize that was the point. Interesting enough to warrant a look, but not quite a hit.  
tt0299014; I think it's safe to say Lucky is a dark comedy. A pitch black comedy. Shot on a shoestring budget, it boasts reasonable production values, and some pretty damned good acting. Particularly from its lead. The abundant voice over narration is often clever, unique, and disturbing. After an engaging first act, the movie lost me a little when it became about its namesake. A dog named LUCKY. The limitations of the budget show here, and a potentially stronger film is squelched. The filmmakers are never able to effectively pull off, in my opinion, a believable talking dog (even if its obviously intended to be a hallucination of the protagonist). Frankly, it comes off continually silly, and without a hint of menace. The last act also is a major cheat, the equivalent of the narrative poison "It was all a dream". For what it was, I enjoyed Lucky. A superior super low budget straight to video movie. If you're not offended by much, it might just be worth a rental. 
tt0299014;   This black comedy and horror hybrid stars Michael Emanuel as cartoon scriptwriter Millard Mudd. Mudd suffers from writer's block, alcoholism and a severely overactive imagination. One day on a late night beer run Mudd mows down a poor dog appropriately named Lucky. In his stupor he takes pity on the dog and takes it home to nurse him back to health. After a few days of heavy sleeping Lucky succumbs to his injuries. As Mudd gives Lucky a `good Christian burial' it appears that Lucky comes back from the dead and begins to dictate scripts telepathically to the very impressionable Mudd. The poor lonely Mudd's fantasy life and reality collide when the girl of his dreams enters his life and brings him floating back towards reality. But his happiness comes to an abrupt end when Lucky puts an end to his happiness and leads Mudd down the path of murder and debauchery.  This indie feature written by Stephen Sustarsic and helmed by first-time director Steve Cuden is a cleverly written low budget affair which is entertaining but not laugh out-loud funny. Put together well but lacked the budget to pull together a couple of good gory set pieces that would have helped the film tremendously. The writing and directing are good but a quicker pace may have helped the film too.  A good but unfulfilling dark comedy that has a twisted laugh every now and again and touches on horror elements but never seems to commit to either one wholeheartedly.Suspiria10 gives it a C-.  
tt0299014;  I saw this film at the New York City Horror Film Festival, and have to say it was one of the scariest but funniest movies I've ever seen.  I was laughing out loud when at the very same time I was scared half to death by Millard Mudd, the lead character.  This movie is brainey, sick, and yet very entertaining.  I couldn't believe how I was laughing even at the most horrifying things.  Very well done!  It truly deserved to win Best Film at the festival.  I really reccommend it if you like creepy black comedies.  
tt0299014; The story is a bit cold-blooded, but the dialog between Millard the mediocre writer and Lucky the demonic dog is some of the wittiest ever you'll hear in American film. And the sparkling cast does the dialog justice. A minor morbid gem along the lines of "Eating Raul" and "The Honeymoon Killers." The writer, Stephen Sustarsic, have a long and extensive background in television sitcoms, but here he seems to have let his unbridled id indulge in the sort of Rabelasian humor that the networks would NEVER allow. As it is, this movie's take on every writer's nightmare when facing creative paralysis cuts a lot deeper than anything Stephen King has managed. 
tt0299014;  To be humorous on a low budget feature is often a very difficult task.  To blend humor and horror is an even more arduous task.  But director Steve Cuden does so with such imagination and creativity.  With a feature that can best be described as daring, Cuden has created a jet black comedy that will chill you.  With great performances and a distinct visual style, this hybrid film will thoroughly entertain and sit up and beg for repeat viewings. Definitely, check this film out! 
tt0299014;  I bought the DVD of Lucky after reading about it on a horror film site I stumbled across. I just watched it and was very, very impressed. Other comments accusing the film of misogyny are, in my view, misguided. Every abuse and sadistic scene is set up in such a way that, well, I'll abide by the SPOILER warning and not spell it out here, but if you watch the film (and I strongly recommend you do) then you'll see what I mean. All in all I felt this was excellent story telling, really communicating the inherently terrifying concept of what it would FEEL like to lose your mind. That (in answer to some of the previous comments) is what makes it a horror film, and a damn effective one at that. Congratulations to the guys who made it and I'll be sure to check out anything else that the writer and director make in the future.  
tt0299014;  i'm not sure what the other comment was about, but they had it dead wrong. this movie is not meant for people who are close minded. the movie in no way condones any of the behaviors of the characters depicted. this is the most original movie i've ever seen. it could be said that this movie would be offensive to just about anyone. you just can't take it as if its actually a true story. i know it says its a true story, but thats just a joke, since at the end of the credits you get one of those "any resemblance to....was purely unintentional..blah blah blah" things at the end. The movie is not only hilarious, but its shockingly charming and awkward. nothing about this movie says "hollywood". its so god damn independent, its great. i'd make sure you are uptight and close minded before watching. if you strongly believe that jesus will bring you to greatness, you are a tard and shouldn't see this film. the movie seems a bit student-film-ish when you watch it, but it after watching for a bit, it seems intentional. it's great. if you like comedies that are over the edge, this one defines the genre. your life will be forever changed after watching this flick  
tt0299014; Lucky (2004) I have no idea what to say about this movie, I saw two night ago, I still can't find words to tell how it felt.Well the movie was very low budget movie and very strange with all the flashing and thinking scenes from killing and the scenes repeating them self. There were some decent funny moments in this movie, which made me laugh , He dated his half sister, who had a bigger penis then him lol . I had me laughing few seconds, something I didn't like this movie, sleeping with dead that was bit to far!)I thought story about dog controlling his owner, would of been a decent plot but this movie was just so Bizarre.The dog was cute in every scenes, voice for the dog didn't really suit the dog at all, he didn't seem really.Had some bloody moment, as some comedy moments but had some moments, were I think the movie went to far, I had to fast forward one scenes, I thought it was bad taste. 4 out of 10 
tt0299014; A writer who has lost his way hits a small dog one night while drunk driving. After taking the dog home and nursing him back to life (a dog called Lucky, by the way) the writer begins to hear voices and his writing improves. But what is the hidden cost? In many ways, the writing of this movie is by far its best strength, but also its weakness. The first ten or twenty minutes have some of the best writing I've ever seen in a horror film -- the monologue is crisp, well-thought out and transcends the simplicity and one-dimensionalness usually found in horror characters. The sad thing is, though, that while the writer is really good at this... they seem to lack the ability to move beyond this. The film never stops being self-reflective to move on to a real plot-driven film.Now, I'm not saying the plot is bad. A speaking dog telling a man how to write and then trying to run his life is a good story, especially when it leads to murder. But the plot doesn't evolve -- it's still in the same place throughout much of the film (and it doesn't help the action never leaves the man's living room).The dog's voice was annoying to me, and we could have used less of this (again, it tends to become repetitious after a while with no progress). But when your story revolves around the dog, I guess you're only given so many options.Another strength was the grotesque and violent (yet, in some ways comedic) sex scenes. The average viewer would probably be appalled by the violence and the man's cold callousness. And yes, there's necrophilia. But I think this is something many horror fans will appreciate -- I saw the film with two women, which was odd, but still found the scenes as appropriate as I did disturbing.Overall, the film is okay and in fact quite decent if you look beyond the dragging in the second half. As I've said, the writing is excellent and the acting in all cases is also great (everyone was perfectly in character and had that morbid humor I think was necessary). You could do worse than this, and if you're looking for evil dog movies, this beats the pants off stupidity like Wes Craven's "The Breed". 
tt0033014; Snappy mystery with perhaps a far-fetched premise but George Sanders at his suave and wry best. George Sanders is ahead of the police all of the way and he again manipulates them into succeeded despite their best efforts. The Saint, remarks Professor Horatio Bitts, "has never been convicted of a crime, has he?" OK, perhaps it is a bit much that we all have a double that so resembles us that even our most close confidants would not recognize us. OK, so from time to time it is difficult to tell on a black on white screen whether George is playing the Saint or his look-alike jewel thief "Boss Duke Bates." OK, so what does the "ST" ring really have to do with anything and which character had it in his possession? But consider that in this entry into the series, we have George Sanders cross-dressing and leaping fearlessly on the back of moving vehicles from which he is poised to save a damsel in distress! Not the greatest film, but certainly not the worst of the Saint lot if you include the group done with Sanders brother. The Saint's Double Trouble is better than most of the one hour produced for TV mysteries that we are subjected to today. Jonathan Hale is perfect as Inspector Fernack and Donald MacBride does yeoman service as the Philadelphia police chief of detectives. Bela Lugosi must have needed the work. One of two of Helene Whitney's credited films. Her most memorable line is the closing line of the film: "Long live the Saint." 
tt0033014; Simon Templar (George Sanders), known as "The Saint", whom everyone believed to be in Egypt, suddenly turns up back in Philadelphia, at the home of his friend, Professor Bitts (Thomas W. Ross). Although the reasons aren't given in the film, apparently there is some disagreement over Simon's moral character. When bodies start turning up with incriminating evidence pointing to The Saint, the police try to track him down. However, it turns out that there is more to the story than meets the eye.I probably shouldn't be reviewing this film until I watch it again (if I do), but I'll just revise my review then if appropriate. As it stands, I have to give this film a generous 4 out of 10.While The Saint's Double Trouble has promise--nice black and white photography, some good performances (especially by Sanders and Jonathan Hale as inspector Fernack), one of my favorite actors/character actors, Bela Lugosi, has an odd part in it, and the story seems like it should be interesting--the script was a disaster. Part of the problem may have been that this is apparently an entry in a long-running series, and there's no way it's going to make sense out of the context of the series. I haven't seen any of the other films yet, so I have to review this one in isolation.The script ends up being largely loose threads. Important parts of the backstory are neither shown nor explained. There is a mummy (the presence of which got me very interested in the beginning) that ends up being meaningless to the plot (the little use it had could have been much more easily accomplished by another means). At one point, half of a knife makes an appearance as a token of a mystery, but it is never mentioned again. Characters completely drop out of the film.Worst of all, the plot hinges on the appearance of Boss Duke Bates, a look-alike for Simon Templar, also played by George Sanders. As can be expected, there are a number of points that rest on confused identities (that's the bulk of the film, actually). The problem is that by the end, I was also so confused that I had no idea which appearance of George Sanders was supposed to be which character, and confusion on this didn't seem to be the point of the conclusion.Again, maybe this is a fine chapter in a longer story when viewed with the other Saint films, in order. But to start here, I can't recommend The Saint's Double Trouble. It doesn't work as a stand-alone film. 
tt0033014; One reviewer said this film is strictly for fans of the series and I tend to agree, though non-fans could still watch it and enjoy it if they aren't overly critical of the film's silly plot. Now as for me, I love old B-detective series films and don't mind the silliness too much--after all, if you think too much, films about Charlie Chan, Boston Blackie and the like are pretty tough to believe. Suspending disbelief and just enjoying them for the fun of it is definitely how you need to approach most of these films. In a way, they were like the modern detective TV show (such as "Murder She Wrote" or "Columbo")--predictable, sure, but still engaging.This film starts off pretty well, as we see that one of the supporting characters is Bela Lugosi--that's a definite plus. However, a bit later, the silliness of the plot becomes very apparent when viewers are expected to believe that there is an exact double of Simon Templer AND this double is evil and wanted by the police. Additionally, Lugosi isn't really given much to do and is wasted. Also, considering how famous Templer is supposed to be, don't you think the cops would have realized the crook was an exact double for Templer a long time before? While "The Patty Duke Show" and other TV shows and movies have given us the concept of identical doubles, this is just silly and impossible to believe. Now had this double deliberately gotten plastic surgery to make himself look like Templer, this COULD have been a decent plot idea (like was done in a classic episode of "Hawaii 5-0"), but we are to assume that they are exact in every way (including accent)--all by chance!!Additionally, late in the film, the conclusion becomes WAY TOO COMPLICATED. Templer COULD have easily exposed the double and wrapped everything up well--but then he dresses like a lady and gets himself to switch places with the phony! This just made no sense at all and seemed like padding. Also, leads like the mummy, the knife blade and the ring are never really developed--like the script was still in need of a re-write.While I always like the Saint movies, I do have to admit that this is one of the worst due to the writing. No matter how hard George Sanders tries to carry the film, it sinks beneath plot holes and I could see non-fans of the genre disliking the film if they can't ignore all the problems with the plot. Fun but flawed. 
tt0033014;  Unlike James Bond, the equally debonair Saint never made a successful transition to film from the fictional works of Leslie Charteris.  Charteris hated all the film Saints - George Sanders, Hugh Sinclair and Leslie Howard. He thought that Cary Grant was the ideal choice for the role.  But in the 1940s, the film industry would only make B-movies featuring the Saint. Since Cary Grant did not appear in B-movies, George Sanders got the role. He was popular in it at that time.  Sanders always played suave cads extremely well.  The Saint of the novels was also a suave cad, yet his creator did not approve of George Sanders.  Charteris probably disliked Sanders because the latter did not physically resemble his creation.  Roger Moore, the Saint of the small screen, came much closer to Charteris' ideal."The Saint's Double Trouble" is worth watching if you are Saint fan.  If you like the sneering, sardonic George Sanders like I do, you will like it.(Reviewed by Sundar Narayan) 
tt0033014; You have to be willing to suspend disbelief whenever you watch films like THE SAINT'S DOUBLE TROUBLE, in which GEORGE SANDERS (as "The Saint") discovers that the police are really looking for his exact double who's been committing a number of crimes involving diamond smuggling and a mummy from Egypt. To make sure that audiences know which man we're watching, they have "The Saint" whistling his famous tune as a sort of identification bracelet...but unless you're a fan of the series, you may be missing the clue.JONATHAN HALE is a nice addition to the cast as Inspector Fernack who, for awhile, is just as confused as everyone else as to the identity of the real criminal. HELENE WHITNEY makes a bland leading lady as the blonde damsel in distress and BELA LUGOSI has a nothing role as a man called The Partner, a colorless part that could have been filled by any nondescript actor in search of work.There are plenty of escapes for Sanders who is seen narrowly drowning when tied up in a motorboat, leaping onto the back of moving autos to keep track of the kidnapped heroine and making various narrow escapes from the law by devious means. It's his third time as Simon and he looks comfortable enough in the double role, although all the plot twists and turns are a bit hard to swallow with the police and the criminals being unbelievably dumb.Summing up: Despite obvious drawbacks, it's a fun caper to watch and moves briskly toward a satisfying ending if you're a fan of the series. 
tt0033014; There's a dead ringer for Simon Templar operating as a crime kingpin in PhiladelphiaÂ and he's started leaving the Saint's calling card at crime scenes. Will the real Simon Templar please come investigate?Meanwhile, the Saint's old friend Inspector Fernack (Jonathan Hale) is on vacation inÂ<U+0097>you guessed itÂ<U+0097>Philadelphia. He stops at the department to visit old friend Deputy Chief Bohlen (Donald MacBride)Â<U+0097>and tags along with him on a murder case that turns up the Saint's calling card. Fernack is on the job.George Sanders pulls double duty as both Simon Templar and his counterpart, "The Boss" of Philadelphia crime, in this far-fetched but entertaining mystery. The hero's look-alike, and a single actor playing both roles, is not an especially unique idea, and this particular version of that old plot doesn't offer any special twists or turns. Basically, the Saint encounters mistaken identity, sets out to clear his name, runs into dangerÂ .Sanders is, of course, very good. Hale is also fine as Inspector Fernack, and the picture's best scenes are mostly those between Sanders and Hale, as once again outward gruffness partly veils their mutual respect and admiration.Bela Lugosi is a henchman with a thick accent, somewhat disappointingly, his role here is rather bland and Lugosi becomes just another actor. Helene Whitney is fine as an old flame of Simon's whose professor father is unwittingly drawn into the bad guys' plot, again, her performance is good but the role is rather predictable. A rather slow middle section is redeemed by an exciting final third, culminating in a neat and clever resolutionÂ . Overall: nothing exceptional but smoothly produced and certainly easy to take, especially for fans of the Saint or Sanders or B mysteries in general. 
tt0033014;  This really is the worst Saint film starring George Sanders. The whole idea of the Saint having an exact double is not too credible but the filmmakers milk it for all it is worth. This results in a confusing film that is short on mystery and long on ridiculous coincidences. The crooks are a very stupid lot in this film. Even the presence of Bela Lugosi does nothing to help the film. He just turns out to be as stupid as the others. George Sanders does what he can with the limited script. He is as suave as ever as Simon Templar but flat as the head of the criminal gang. The scenes pairing Simon with Inspector Fernack(Jonathan Hale) are easily the best in the film. Sanders and Hale click well together as they did in their previous Saint films together. Too bad the story is such a let-down. Only worth seeing for Sanders and Hale. I give it 3 halos out of 10. 
tt0033014; George Sanders, in fact two George Sanders, arrive in the City of Brotherly Love to investigate a nice little diamond smuggling racket. But what a place to smuggle diamonds, in the sarcophagus of a long dead Egyptian mummy. What interests Simon Templar however is the fact that the head of the racket is a dead ringer for him and also played by George Sanders. He might well be responsible for the unsavory reputation the Saint has in some quarters.Jonathan Hale as Inspector Fernack is in from New York and as the most authoritative expert on the activities of Simon Templar is drafted by the Philadelphia police in the person of Donald MacBride. In fact Fernack knows of a telltale scar on the wrist of the real Templar and can tell them apart. That fact proves most handy.Bela Lugosi has an inexplicably small role as 'the partner' in the smuggling activities. I'm betting the editors at RKO probably left a lot of Lugosi on the cutting room floor. The film would have been better had Lugosi been left in.As it is it's an OK B programmer and a plus for fans of Leslie Charteris's modern Robin Hood. 
tt0033014; George Sanders was suave as the not quite wholesome gentleman adventurer The Saint but this B movie took the biscuit with its lacklustre, silly and confusing plot.Things start of well with Bela Lugosi popping up in Egypt and it seems an exact double has been smuggling diamonds involving a mummy from Egypt.We are unsure when Sanders pops up whether he is the Saint or the double. One plot point is that the Mummy has been to sent to his old lecturer who and his daughter have been friends with the real saint but who is this man who looks and sounds like him. How convenient.It might be that the real saint whistles his tune before he shows up or the villainous double has a tattoo.Jonathan Hale is Inspector Fernack who is just as confused as everyone else as. Nothing more is made of Lugosi who is wasted in a nothing roles and he is as confused as the audience and he no need to his stock of opium to get there.There is a nice sequence at the end as the Saint escapes from a leaking motorboat when he is all tied up but further silliness ensures that the Saint and his double swap places in his prison cell. This is not the best plotted or enjoyable of the Saint series. 
tt0033014; "The Saint's Double Trouble" is a 1940 entry into the series starring George Sanders.Simon has sent a mummy of a Pharaoh to a friend, an archeology professor named Bitts. Jewel thief Duke Bates has used the mummy to smuggle illegal diamonds into the country.Bates is a Templar lookalike who uses his resemblance to kill as The Saint and leave his Saint calling card. So in order to clear himself, Simon has to find out what's going on.These second features were usually made in a few days with very little in the way of rehearsal. Therefore, to have George Sanders play a double role under those conditions had to be very difficult.In fairness to Sanders, he was a very good actor and given more time, he could have differentiated a little more between Simon Templar and his double, Duke Bates.However, it became very confusing as to which one was The Saint and which one was Duke Bates. After awhile, I gave up. Duke Bates spoke a little more roughly than Simon, but it wasn't consistent.Not the best film in an otherwise enjoyable series. 
tt1836883; Today, when myself and my friend entered the theater, the first few rows were empty but I still had faith in RADHAMOHAN,well he hasn't failed to deliver! A well made movie and the best part is that it doesn't have a single song:)that's something great about the film. It shows that only when a person who loves cinema,produces a film it'll come out well as Prakashraj has done in this film.Casting was nice and apt! A separate comedy track travels throughout the film mocking nowadays' unrealistic tamil films. For,the very first time in a tamil film the public(hostages)have reacted instead of just sitting and watching the show!So, as far as the acting department is concerned,everybody did their job perfectly!!Editing was nice except for the title sequence, it made me not to look at the screen. Art work is excellent:)the plane and the Tirupati Airport's set was almost like the original.Only 8 because of the BGM and bad sound mixing and sound editing and for terrible CG works:(.But still the steady first half and the racy second half makes the movie HOT!!!! 
tt1836883; Wow! This is the best Indian thriller I have ever seen. I feel prakash   raj productions now has got the "has to be good" look like how Aamir   Khan production house has got! This guy makes classy movies and   attracts the crowd. And this movie is damn neat.    The movie is basically about terrorism and an hijack situation   (Actually we have seen many vijaykanth movies where he single handedly   tackles the terrorists and saves the people). The movie starts with a   lot of characters being introduced. And the beginning of the movie   looks like its inspired from "United 93". Well there cannot be much of   a difference in hijacking sequences. The passengers belong to all sect   of the society. There is a movie star (Prithvi), a retired army   officer, a minister, a church father, a Pakistani family and lot of   common people.    As the movie goes on there are few dialogues which are really good.   Like the dialogue where an atheist character tells the reason for   problems in India is mainly because of so many divisions thats been   caused by religions. The dialogues of the movie is a huge positive. And   there are few instances where a common man feels that what ever his   star does on screen is true and keeps irritating him to go fight the   terrorists.    As time goes on, the terrorists terrorize the passengers and place   their demands. Here Prakash Raj, Nagarjuna and the rest of the   government ppl arrive. They come to know that the demands are too huge   like ransom and the release of a dreaded terrorist who has striking   resemblances to a real life terrorist.    Then unexpectedly the terrorist dies in a freak accident (divine   justice) and this puts the team of Prakash Raj and Nagarjuna in a spot   of bother. The rest of the movie deals with how they handle the   situation and save the passengers.    The positives out of the movie are the dialogues, terrific acting from   the cast, the bgm and the intensity of the movie. Obvious special   references has to be given to Prakash Raj and Nagarjuna. They literally   stole the show even though the people in the plane displayed   awesomeness in their acting. And its tough to get comedy out of actors   in a tough situation but the director has achieved it superbly by   giving some very nice enjoyable scenes.    This movie rocks and its another gem from the Prakash Raj production   house. Don't miss this movie for any reason as the feel can be got only   in the theaters as the bgm booms in your ears. 
tt1836883; Radha Mohan has tried to travel in the unfamiliar terrains for the first time in "Payanam" which is an action thriller whilst his previous 3 movies were feel good family entertainers. It is refreshing that the director has tried to break away from the mould but that he is clearly uncomfortable in handling an action subject with A©lan shows. Movie though set in an novel backdrop & managed to do away with the routine hero-heroine pattern as well as songs , the backdrop gets tiring after a while. Agreed it is a very difficult job to sustain the interest of the viewers in such kind of subject , RadhaMohan could have thought something out of the box rather than taking recourse to his trademark comical one-liners which doesn't gel well with the movie of this genre.Movie has an artificiality writ large all over it & in some places the happening borders on a stage drama like. Though they have tried hard to showcase the production values as high as possible unfortunately the averageness of it comes out . Though the director manages to pump in the adrenaline here & there , they are very few to warrant any significance. Also the recourse to melodrama , contrived nationalistic jingoism & comedy in the most unwarranted of sequences makes "Payanam" a very average travel.As far as the ensemble cast goes Nagarjuna , Prakashraj , M.S.Baskar , Kumaravel , Chaams shines in their roles . Others in the cast are adequate though those who play the terrorist hams & overacts.Background score of Praveen Mani hurts the viewers ear drums. It's a very average work by the Musician , may be Radha should have stuck on with Vidhyasagar one more time.K.V.Guhan's cinematography is good & manages to infuse frenzy into the happenings.On the whole , "Payanam" is a strictly average offering from the makers of such remarkable movies like "Azhagiya Theeye " , "Mozhi" & "Abhiyum Naanum".Bottomline: an arduous journey...! 
tt0417182; Perhaps the Wagner clan found making it cathartic, but for the viewer it is merely punishment.Not rising to the truly repulsive, the infantile self-absorption of the cast would drive most any non-Wagner to claw his or her way out of the speeding van even at the risk of life and limb.The quirky annoyance factor of the cast (particulary of the straw-chewing patriarch) is not matched by an emotional pay-off. The (spoiler alert! z-z-z-z-z...) reconciliation is utterly toothless. These people SHOULD be separated.This indie movie is scary in that it shows how little money and little talent are required to get drek produced nowadays. 
tt0417182; I am more and more disappointed by the quality of 'independent films' that appear ever more often on Sundance Channel (where I saw this film), and IFC, and with the honesty of reviews found on this website.As far as Sundance and IFC go - I simply have to assume that ever since the 'independent' genre made it big, finding quality programming that draws an audience without having to pay great sums must be becoming increasingly difficult.As far as the reviews on this website go I feel that films, especially small films like this, are reviewed favorably primarily because of shills. Maybe they are friends of the filmmaker, and family members, etc. And you know, if I were a filmmaker, I would certainly enlist those I know to do the same.The truth is this film is pretty bad, and pretty unwatchable, and if I cast my mom and dad in a movie (and they are in many ways like the couple in the film), my film would undoubtedly be pretty bad too. But you see - I would never take my home movies to Sundance, and pitch them shamelessly to further my career (or lack thereof).I feel sorry for Andrew's parents - who probably just want to see their son succeed in this business - but their acting was awful - although 'realistic', to be sure.In fact the 'professional actors (there are very few people in reality who are)' in this film, oddly, seemed 'more real' than the director/writer's real parents. But somehow at some level I think that the director may have chosen his parents as his 'human shield' against criticism of this film.But it's not just bad acting, it's bad editing, and I guess, my inability to suspend disbelief at everything happening in this film that ruins this film.The bottom line - a bad film that ends up, inexplicably on Sundance, because it probably cost them little to nothing to get it, and well, the director gets the visibility.Someone needs to set this film straight for other users. 
tt0417182; Watching this collection of people both fascinated and disgusted me. The odd interchanges between the two "adults" were embarrassing, disjointed, truly horrible. The few scenes of kindness toward one another were almost worse than their mutual spitefulness. Watching the father with his multiple mouth fixations nearly made me gag. Usually I enjoy independent films, I can't see the reasoning behind any aspect of plot, character development (or lack thereof), or conflict. The only thing I felt was understandable was why the son had moved so far away from these self-centered, thoroughly unredeeming characters making up his creepy twisted family tree. If I really had it in for someone, I would force him to watch this inaccurately titled movie. 
tt0417182; I wish I could change my star-rating to 4.I agree: All this praise of Wagner's film seems unwarranted. I was rather disappointed with it. My husband and I had the same reaction, immediately after viewing it: It seems to need more art, more fiction. It is indeed strange that somehow the daughters (apparently professional actresses) seem more "real" than their parents... or is it? Yes, I can hear the filmmaker and his fans saying that's just because this post-modern culture has conditioned us to see the fake as real, and vice-versa. But no matter, I found myself rather appalled and disgusted, during much of the film, and barely engaged. There's a whole lotta pathos going on, that's for sure. I wonder about the "comedy" label.I suppose the ending is supposed to be some kind of zen/enlightenment thing, but in my opinion it just fell flat. (I'm not sure if that qualifies as a spoiler, but I just wanted to play it safe.) 
tt0417182; If you were born and raised in the tristate area NY/NJ/CT and you are not Jewish, you'll find this movie equivalent to a case of hives! The loud, brash, self-centered nature of each of these individuals is beyond belief. If they are a slice of America, it is no wonder we are in debt to the Chinese and Indians and have lost total identity as a nation! This family is a family of infants in a crib (car) squabbling over who's got the gum. The rabid mother has steam rolled over everyone she ever met complaining as she stomped them to death. The daughters cannot believe they are not the queens of the world yet. They would masturbate in public to get attention. The father has spent his life wed to his business and paid the price with medical problems that have left him incontinent and unable to speak without a straw in his mouth. The son is a closet case living in LA who has no cellphone in order to become unreachable to the family arm which is constantly reaching for him. They endlessly bitch about not having enough of everything. They are thankful for nothing. If you like soulessness and despair, watch it. If you think being Jewish is funny, watch it. If you have a life, skip it. 
tt0417182; Like fascination with a train wreck, this movie leaves one a bit shameful for any interest and wishing the time had been spent better elsewhere.Only a step above the Borat flick in its believability and likability of the main characters, it is just one long definition of "The Ugly American". There may be a good deal of fiction, but there seems to be enough reality behind and among it all to find it much more creepy than appealing. Or even amusing.I sincerely hope these people can manage to find some value in themselves and their lives, as that appears to be their primary ambition in life. Yet, it is truly painful watching so many people making themselves, and anyone else unfortunate enough to cross their path, so abjectly miserable. Particularly the mother. Eeeesssh!Not to be taken internally! 
tt0417182; This film made me care for the characters right from the start. It has a healthy dose of reality, in places perhaps too stark for some in the audience. It gives some interesting insights into aging, whether it is the parents in their 70s or the daughter and her friend (?) in their 30s. Despite each of the parents aging differently and the wife being discontented with her husband, their love for each other comes through. The ups and downs of their relationship are only too real. The daughter's insecurities about her body image (and desire to go under the knife) faithfully reflects the way many young women feel and think. For those who think that the film doesn't really amount to anything and was not worth their while don't want this kind of reality. Because the characters are playing themselves with all their flaws and somewhat fractured lives. Many viewers want to get away from it all, for them this movie likely has little to offer. As for the comments made by arassweiler on this film, I don't buy into his/her assumption (or accusation) that most of the reviews here are done by "shills" who are likely friends of the film maker and have padded up IMDb reviews simply because they want the film to succeed. Neither do I get the thing about using parents to deflect real criticism. That is about the most meaningless comment anyone could have made about this film. It is definitely worth seeing. But if you are into a lot of Hollywood's over-produced or even well made celebrity/star laden films then this film is certainly not for you. The film is funny at times, and at times has an underlying tragic tenor. But it is a film where characters are human enough to confront their demons and limitations, overcoming some and failing at some. And I was definitely entertained by the film. Barring my cautions for certain types of film-goers whom I described above I think this film is pretty much "must-see". Especially if you are not put off by too much reality depicting characters who are imperfect in every way, but are perfectly human. 
tt0417182; Most films have protagonists between the ages of 25 and 45. In childhood and adolescence, one identifies with them as grownups. As the years pass, the view becomes as contemporaries. I've only gotten as far as late middle age, but at this point, while I can be lulled into a sort of suspension of disbelief and view characters 15 years my junior at eye level, more and more, I identify with their parents. This is abetted as the boomer generation ages, and many people now long in the tooth formed their adult identities during and after the values shift of the 1960's.That said, when you look at the Wagners' relationship from the vantage point of a certain age, one can understand why two people bonded by parenthood and hard experience through the years might persist in a union where romantic love is a distant memory. Familiarity, trust, recollection of how much worse other potential mates were during one's dating years, and fear of going it alone make their presence felt. In your 50's or your 70's, one wonders "Who would want me now?"For most of us, this is as happy an ending as we're going to get, like it or not. There comes a time when one is too tired, too sick, and/or too set in one's ways to start over yet again. Successfully rearing a child has its rewards, and as libido wanes, sometimes that's enough. One's acrimonious relationship with one's mate can be a shelter without alternative.This film takes an unflinching look at these realities...what is, as opposed as to what "should be," to borrow a distinction often made by Lenny Bruce. Acceptance is the last of the seven stages of grief. Or to quote an old Country/Western song title, "It's not love...but it's not bad." 
tt0417182; Just viewed this film and I enjoyed it primarily because of the fact that Wagner did something no one had ever done before. Everybody does pieces about their families, but I don't remember anyone ever actually getting their entire family to do a semi biographical piece about themselves, where they all acted together.I really liked the Dad. I think men of that generation, that provided for their families and did absolutely everything they were supposed to do, whether they liked it or not, are very undervalued.One thing that left me chuckling, I've been having a terrible time at lately with fabulous new releases and poor sound,scores swelling over dialogue when I'm trying to watch with the volume on low in my apartment. It's been a while since I heard every word in a film without an over posh score drowning out the mumbling actors.I guess being heard has never been a problem for this family. 
tt0417182; there is some real wisdom in this movie, and the characters are real. i don't know if this is the actual story of the Wagner family, or if in fact they're just a great family who love to create works of art as a team. but i came to IMDb today to find out, because i was truly touched and impressed by this movie. i love the scene where the younger daughter is psychoanalyzing the mother as they travel cross country. The mother tells her story of betrayal: the father cheated on her, left her to whore around with a lot of different women, then finally returns months later. With just a tiny tinge of bitterness but totally cognizant of the irony, she says, "He sits down at the table and says, 'i need 5000 dollars.' He was totally broke!" With that comment the viewer gets a huge insight into this woman's lifelong pain. The man she loved did not love her too. 
tt0369878; I saw "AFR" last week in an inner city Copenhagen cinema with a few friends, all hoping to be provoked, inspired and certainly entertained. Well, we were all somewhat entertained by the absurdity of seeing the danish prime minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen portrayed absolutely fictionally vague in his grasp of political ideologies, as well as the pathetically desperate attempt at trying to cut him down to a very human size in the shape of a love-desperate closet homosexual, which allows us to both patronize and in the end sympathize with him. Somewhat entertaining. Ultimately failing at carrying the weight of the task the director attempts to undertake.Obviously the disclosure of the personal life of important political figures are somewhat interesting, but I'm utterly befuddled with why one would attempt at trying to raise such thought-provoking issues and absolutely vital questions concerning the current danish and international state of politics and the media, and in the end chose to go so exploitative and low-brow about it. What was supposed to be a movie about how tight the borders around such things as freedom of speech, sexuality, ideology, and so on, ended up being a rather hurried satirical tale told from a tongue tied at all times where it attempts to preach its personal definition of tolerance. If this is the consequence of the thinking that spawned such a feeble screenplay, then the thought process behind such writing is on all levels incredibly uninteresting in the context of the discussions that the movie tries to ignite.Granted, vulgar attempts at intellectualism aside, the movie is not entirely without merits, and one thing worth noting is the interesting use of editing interviews and manipulating words of various political figures portrayed in news footage. Such a practice is one known to be used by the popular media, and it's absolutely interesting to be witnessing this strategic instrument used to fabricate truths quite unlike those with whom we're accustomed to seeing the danish prime minister spun into.Technically, (without myself being a diploma-holding dramaturge) the pace of the movie seemed very rushed, not in the sense that there wasn't a decent build up. It just felt like the character development was so forced, and lacked subtlety to a tenth, which severely hurt the believability of the story that emerges from the premise. The acting was artificial at times, and though its was apparent to the audience that the format was documentary, many of the actors and actresses was obviously encouraged to try to "act" naturally. Something that made it extremely difficult to maintain a suspended disbelief.In short, this film was entertaining, but it failed at all attempts to raise any serious questions. Once the audience has become satisfied with mundane, such as "what if the prime minister was homosexual", then that's what the debate would be about. I give the movie 5 out of 10, and mostly because of the skilled, though unremarkable editing, and because of the element of sensationalism that the movie brings to the table. 
tt0369878; Very impressive film. It's a sharp and thoughtful movie with provocative and make-you-think story. It appeals both to emotional and rational parts of your personality. I don't know if it's a real story or not, but it makes you believe. What is shown there is so damn true for the modern society! To describe it briefly it looks like a documentary that is built on the interviews with different people. One line of the plot is the story of Danish prime-minister's murder. The second line starts with a cruel murder of a young guy Emil. We hear people talking about prime-minister, then about Emil, discovering their personalities, gradually understanding where they came from and how they've become who they were. Both are much into politics, so it's a film not only about personalities, not only about love, death, self-expression and searching for one's place in the world. It is also about social problems, politics, globalization, extremism. It is definitely worth to see. I think a good movie is a movie that makes you feel a bit different after it's finished. This one does. 
tt0369878; What is the worst thing you can say about a movie that is supposed to provoke? God damn boring! Being Danish and having lived in Denmark during the time the move should portrait. I can say that the characters are completely unreal and the movie dose not in any way portrait the society it is supposed to.This movie is a complete waste of time and an embarrassment for the Danish film industry.Don't waste you time. 
tt0087181;NA
tt1204938; "Darling, don't lie" is a comedy with bright dialogs, talented actors and views of Cracow as a bonus. Ania and Magda have met as small girls in an orphanage. Now Ania is a student while Magda works in a supermarket. The girls share an apartment in Warsaw - actually an adapted attic of a house, house roof beams are visible since there is no ceiling. Ania's vision of Prince Charming materializes as her neighbor Marcin - who pays no attention to her. Marcin is a playboy who lost his job but still lives above his means and his large debts are catching up with him. His financial salvation could be his Aunt Nela who lives in Britain but currently visits his parents in Cracow. There is a catch: the aunt wants to see a suitable fiancA©e of Martin. Martin calls his numerous former girlfriends one after another, each rejects his offer to play the role of the fiancA©e. They enjoy the rejection - a moment of triumph after being brutally abandoned by Marcin. Now Marcin has no other option but to enlist the help of Ania, she does so lying to her, lies are his way of life. When in Cracow a big lie comes out, Piotr Adamczyk as Marcin shows his formidable histrionic talent, for the first time since his childhood Marcin wants to tell the truth - to Ania - and his internal struggle not to resort to lies once again is tremendous to watch. The DVD contains interviews with the actors. Marta Zmuda Trzebiatowska describes her role as Ania: Ania is not naive. This is worth saying since Ania has limited life experience because of her orphanage past. In the scene with her lecherous boss, first Ania does not know how to handle him. However, since she is highly intelligent, she soon figures out a way. Other actors display their talents too: Magdalena Schejbal as Magda (a coincidence?), Grazyna Szapolowska as Marcin's mother, and as always inimitable Beata Countess Tyszkiewicz as Aunt Nela. Recent German films have sound tracks in at least four languages. The director of "Darling, don't lie" Piotr Weresniak did a good job. The producer Piotr Weresniak turned out to be a moron. On our DVD there is no sound track in English, Spanish, Portuguese, French and/or German. Even English subtitles are missing. Thus, in Brazil alone 200 millions people will not see this film - and so among others will not see views of night Cracow taken by the cinematographer Piotr Weresniak. 
tt1354564; I had to sleep on this film to really get it.What happens: An utterly french form of cinematic licence generates classic and true surreal humour. A playful narrative reversal based on an all prevailing rule of 'what if' . What if: 1.You take a common narrative - the straight married man's midlife crisis leads him to seek comfort in a gay friend and question his sexuality - and reverse that to a partnered non-monogamous gay man has a midlife crisis and seeks comfort in an affair with a teenage girl. 2.You take a common cinematic portrayal of the gay man as young, good looking, urban, sophisticated and inverse that to one of a fat, perhaps unattractive, unsophisticated, small town (straight butch role of) tractor dealer. This narrative inverse generates the unusual context from which we shall experience provincial french life. From that point, the logic of questioning 'possibility' itself quickly accelerates and dominates the film. What if the Conservative catholic small minded provincial France commonly portrayed as the real France allows for men to commit sodomy and fellatio each other as a matter of course ? What if sex is made predominant on all levels of provincial France - gang rape, gay cruising, underage sex, etc so that in the end the 'what if' logic runs out of control and poses the ultimate question, at what point should one stop undoing expectation and to what extent, if you reverse all expectation, do you alter reality ? The excessiveness of narrative reversal turns out to be a classic surrealist strategy.The English translation of this film is "The King of Escape' - but a better translation would be 'The king of evasion'. Armand carries with him this honour despite on many occasions appearing to look like the ultimate loser. He spends most of his time literally running around France in nothing but his underpants. The question of evasion is central to the purpose and intent of this film. The evasion of expectation at any cost. Armand's midlife crisis embodies that reflex - indeed you could argue all psychological crisis is a play off between the need for confrontation and the desire to escape. The film goads conservative France with a relentless uncomfortable matter of fact explicitness. In doing so it forces both hidden realities and fantasies to the fore. A deceptively simple film turns out to be a clever well thought out and powerful form of speculation about how we implicitly engineer society. 
tt1354564; The King of Escape is two movies in one. On the surface it's an oddball comedy about a gay, 43-year-old tractor salesman called Armand who has a midlife crisis and runs off with an infatuated teenage girl. The humour is both absurdist and deadpan and there's lots of it, so if you're in the mood for some laughs you can switch your brain off and enjoy the unpredictable antics. But underneath the surface this is a film churning with emotion. Armand is comical but his motivations are not. He is popular and social (very social - there's a LOT of sex in this movie) but he appears to have no family. His pastimes all seem to involve solitary exploration - cycling through the countryside, walks through the forest - because Armand is actually a desperately lonely man who is searching for a deeper connection. Nobody really *loves* Armand so he pursues this bizarre relationship because she seems to need him in a way that nobody else in his life does. The King of Escape certainly isn't the first comedy where the main character is motivated by suffering but it's definitely one of the best. BTW, Ludovic Berthillot is excellent as Armand. It's a very brave performance (and not just because he spends so much of it naked). Armand is a tough role but Berthillot never falls back on caricature. Some characters have a rough time and there are serious scenes too, yet Alain Guiraudie is a very generous director. There is no Office-style "cringe" humour and he has such a light touch that you take your medicine without realizing it. Outstanding stuff. 
tt1354564; When I first read about the movie, I thought I might be bored, but I was wrong. The movie is very funny, from beginning to end. The humor is sometimes slight, sometimes obvious, sometimes verbal, sometimes visual. The plot is original and rich. The hero is a gay man in his forties, leading stagnant life, not necessarily fulfilling, but not miserable either. Several things happen that cause him to doubt himself, and develop midlife crisis. He's attempting to make some drastic changes in his life, and goes though a comic journey of finding himself. Although the hero is gay, the story conveys a message that is universally appealing, for gay and straight viewers. Very enjoyable movie! 
tt1354564; In this version of a mid-life crisis story, Alain Guiraudie takes up the adventures of Armand Lacourtade (Gallic film vet Ludovic Berthillot), a well-liked and successful 40-year-old gay tractor salesmen in the South of France who falls by chance into the opportunity to try batting for the opposite team, when he rescues a 16-year-old school girl from some toughs and she falls for him.Armand is fed up with the limited provincial gay scene and his roommate's preference for roadside tricking with decidedly older dudes. He's taken to binge eating and napping on the job and his previously very satisfied boss wants to give him a vacation. Then Armand buys off the toughs who're about to rape the sultry, dark Curly (Hafsia Herzi, a beautiful 20-something who had a key role in Abdel Kechiche's Secret of the Grain), and a world of new opportunities opens.Before long things get complicated and then more complicated still. Armand's association with Curly draws the unwanted and decidedly disapproving attention of a tall, thin, black-suit-clad Commissioner (FranA§ois Clavier), as well as Curly's mean dad (Luc Palun). Curly experiments with an aphrodisiac root (also used by out-of-control village officials) to get it up under these new circumstances, but for quite a while he and Curly are too often being harassed or pursued to be able to get it on, though when they finally do, the movie gets pretty graphic. Mad chase scenes frequently show Armand running around the southern French provincial countryside clad only in bikini briefs. For a man who's distinctly overweight, Berthillot is certainly in excellent shape. Not body-shape, stamina-shape.Armand meanwhile is also being pursued by an older gay man, a fellow of prodigious sexual appetites who at 70 (but he looks 80!) still wants daily lovemaking, and once satisfied his wife on a daily basis (he tells us all this and more). Due to simplistic morals laws the Commissioner puts a plastic electronic tracer bracelet on Armand, and that makes the chase eventually turn into a manhunt involving cops, private citizenry, and a helicopter -- all about nothing in particular. One of the main troubles with Guiraudie's wild adventure is that arresting moments and good dialogue can't save his scenario from remaining a meaningless tangle.Two popular outlets of French hipness, Cahiers du CinA©ma and Les Inrockuptibles, published reviews praising Le roi de l'A©vasion ecstatically. "A hilarious, festive and liberating tale carried along by an exceptional cast" wrote Serge Kaganski in "Les Inrocks." "The hedonistic outlook makes for the gentlest film French cinema is capable of," raves Eugenio Renzi in Cahiers. "One leaves The King of Escape full of wonder," he goes on, "with the impression of having learned to desire all bodies." The latter comment is inspired by the final scene in which a bunch of naked fat middle aged and old gay men are all in bed cuddling.Whether this teaches us to love, or stimulates repulsion, is another question. This is, after all, a comedy, and an oddball, sometimes shockingly crude, one at that, which often seems merely frantic and inexplicable rather than hilarious -- or liberating. It's particularly hard to perceive as liberating images of a 16-year-old girl having sex in the woods with an over-weight middle-aged man in a manner that is not to her liking. In the end, Curly doesn't get very much of value out of all this, and Armand escapes negative consequences a little too easily after his (spoiler alert!) essentially pointless experimentation has taken him pretty much back to where he started.The positive French reactions (though of course not all were positive) can be explained when one reads another comment (from the editors of Ouest France) that Guiraudie's film style is "Rabelaisian." Through that lens, Armand's nude cavorting round the countryside begins to make sense and seem positive. However, neither Guiraudie nor his co-authors Laurent Lunetta and FrA©dA©rique Moreau is within twenty thousand leagues of being on a par with Rabelais. Lauent seems a bit too uncertain a hero to make for a true celebration of life. Call me limited, but the message I get out of this movie is that you don't know for sure if you're gay or not till you've tried straight sex, though I'm not sure any gay person needs to know this. I'm also wondering if this offhand, clichA©-free celebration of gayness doesn't wind up being unintentionally homophobic. This not only isn't Rabelais, Rabelais doesn't play any more. From the modern point of view these characters are drawn too sketchily, and none of the action ever seems remotely real. Perhaps fortunately.Opened June 15, 2009 in Paris to fair reviews. Shown as part of the Rendez-Vous with French Cinema at Lincoln Center, March 2010. 
tt1354564; This is one on the best movies I have seen last year, and was lucky to see once again lately on DVD. It is so fresh, celebrating what is best in life: love, friends, freedom, nature, sensuality, and in an original way, with people you rarely see on movies, I mean elderly farmer, whom are very authentic and funny... Also the director really succeed in creating a world and atmosphere of its own, with incredible character, and succeed every time in surprising you. You also feel sometimes like its a kind of dream, and that the movie beyond its realistic kind is somehow almost fantastic. Of course, if you are the kind of people whom only like classic character, handsome boys and sexy girls, you will be very disappointed. But if you like original and somehow crazy movies, that are sincere and simple, you will definitely like this one! 
tt1354564; Where to begin?!A good start would be the total, even fraudulent,misuse of the word 'comedy' to describe this film. Bearing in mind the storyline (middle aged homosexual man in a small french village becomes involved with a sixteen year old girl), I knew I wouldn't be rolling in the aisles with laughter but I did expect witty, ironic and wry (but not too much since they are French after all ...). What I got was a handful of badly delivered, moderately funny lines and a total absence of any, even slightly, comic scenes. Which brings me to the next problem, the so called plot. Again I didn't expect a Hollywoodian epic, just a well written plot with strong characters.The reality? A series of 'scenes' with no particular sense, a large number of which focused on a man cycling or running or looking socially inept. The characters were one dimensional characters,for which I felt no interest, empathy or affinity. I had no idea where the film was going (nowhere, incidentally)and I had the impression neither did the director. In short I found this film self-satisfied,pretentious and dull. 
tt3149640; I have just left the cinema blinking my way into the late evening glow of the city lights thinking I would have been disappointed after watching a Senna type biopic. However I came away genuinely moved and entertained by this wonderful movie.I would challenge anyone who witnesses the tributes made about this truly inspirational man, that it will not bring a slight lump to the throat.The first hour and a bit does show Seve, the youngest of four brothers, battling to pursue his passion up till the point he plays his local Caddy Championships. This is interlaced with clips of his genius on show. A great deal of the action is well known and been viewed before but there are fascinating interviews around the early 80's when he was struggling to get more money for his art and of course eventually for the benefit of future Tour players.The young actor playing the 9-16 year Seve really looks and plays the part! The film does gloss over or ignores the difficult parts of his life like his time in the army or his sad divorce and his battles with the US Tour, however in the end the film felt about the right length.The film got the point across that if you have a talent and you want to be the best you have to sacrifice enormous time and effort to reach those goals. The film shows this in spades, however it should have mentioned the awful pain he was having with his back even from the start of his time on the Tour which eventually shortened his career.You do not have to love the game to be inspired by this gem and also to feel the genuine emotion from this simple but beautifully shot film. 
tt3149640; As someone who by and large is totally indifferent to sport, reviewing a film about the life of a golfing legend might not be a highly objective task although I would still do my best.Ultimately, this film is about talent and that talent will find a way to flourish no matter what the obstacles are.Seve grew up in a low middle class Spanish household, the son of a farmer. Nothing could be further from his world than golf. Early on in life, he developed an interest that grew with the passing of time to become a full blown passion. That young boy knew he was meant to play golf. Thus, after school and on term time developing his skills as a golfer was the only thing on Seve's mind.The obstacles were of course plenty. Not doing well in school, pressure from home resulted in everything being against him. That did not diminish his passion by one iota. His determination, caused his parents to come to realise that this youngster had made up his mind about life and gold is his choice.From then on, his talent was quickly recognised within his home town, then Spain and ended up becoming an internationally acclaimed sporting personality.Like mentioned earlier, talent will find a way and Seve's found his, illuminating the world of golf. 
tt3149640; I hardly ever give things 10 out of 10, bar Casablanca and Seven, but this film certainly achieves what it sets out to: an enthusiastically-told tribute to what must've been an amazing man. Slightly saccharine flashbacks to his childhood are offset by jaw-dropping footage, interesting interviews and an ending which keeps picking up in emotive punch.Self-indulgence, however, is never a problem (despite a near two-hour running time) as the flashbacks actually end up serving the documentary footage well (the young Seve is a revelation, albeit in a highly specialised role) while the real Seve and his contemporaries add more gravitas, relevance, humour and pathos to the making of this great sportsman.Rounded of with a thumping if samey score, this gets top marks for innovation. One or two less for overall enjoyment perhaps, but that's merely the limit of the story's limited confines. Different, dazzling in places, but they make the best of what's available. And no-one should be penalised for that. 
tt3149640; Motor-sport is made for the bio-pic treatment, as we have seen with Senna and Rush - fast cars, glamour, money, the international circuit, and so on. Golf, on the other hand, would not be high on most people's list of sports likely for the big screen bio-pic treatment. It really would need a very special person to keep anyone other than real fans hooked for nearly two hours (especially when most people already know the story).Fortunately in Seve golf has that story. This really is a tale where fiction could not come close to the reality - the story of a boy from so far the other side of the tracks that there are not even tracks who gets to the top of a sport more associated with money (and appalling fashion sense) than possibly any other by dint of unusual talent, allied to sheer hard work.Even so it needs a cast that you can believe in - and Seve finds it. Admittedly at the start one wondered a bit about whether this all Spanish-speaking cast would be up to it - especially the young lead - as the initial scene-setting creaked a bit at times, but once things got into their stride the result was impressive.The young lead playing the junior Seve is particularly impressive. What is remarkable is that you do not have to like golf at all to love this film. not only his golfing style looked like the real thing, but he also can clearly play a bit - well that or there is some pretty impressive trick photography or hours of film of missed shots on the cutting room floor.And it all builds to a total tear-jerker of a finale, which is impressive as we all know how it will end.You do not have to like golf (I'm no real fan), think of it as a real life rags-to-riches tale like few others. Go see it. 
tt3149640; I really liked this film even though it won't be big box-office. But I am biased. I am a fan and I know the region of Spain from which Seve hails, quite well. Most golfers will enjoy this biopic of one of the most charismatic and magical golfers of his generation. Most Spaniards will be proud of their countryman. And anyone who watches it will be moved. It's a nice, triumphant, emotional and ultimately sad story well told, of a poor boy from Northern Spain who was besotted with golf from an early age. His rise to near deity in the world of golf, loved as much for his outlandish shots as for his dogged determination and sportsmanship, his fall from form and ultimately his sad illness which was so hard to witness, give the viewer a roller-coaster of emotions. It was often said that Seve was "only good at recovery shots because he found himself in trouble so often". But the film suggests that he learned his craft with a single 3 iron playing all shots on uneven beaches and farmland - "everywhere can be a golf course, all you need is imagination" is a phrase that Seve lived by, in his youth and which showed through his style of play Â<U+0096> imaginative. The film merges archive footage (much of which golfers will have seen already) with a dramatisation of Seve's early years to give a good overview of the life of a giant of the game. The tributes, comment and awe from fellow professionals leave you in no doubt that Seve was the professionals' choice for top dog. 
tt3149640; I followed Severiano Ballesteros's career in the 1980s, when my young brother became very interested in golfing and wanted to emulate this talented and charismatic golfer. He would watch Seve's putting and shots in the competitions and he was a kind of hero to my brother. Back then, golfers didn't really have followers but Seve changed all that. He made you feel that anything was possible, if you wanted something badly enough, if you worked hard and made sacrifices, you could achieve your dreams. What a wonderful role model for my brother to have when he was young and the lessons of discipline and being passionate about what you love have never left him.Seve the movie underscores all of these traits and leaves you in awe and near tears for a man who never gave up at anything, who succeeded against quite difficult odds at times and was always supported by a loving family. His early years are movingly portrayed in the village of Pedrina, the youngest in a family of boys who see the shining star that Seve will become. His successes are brought back to life with the wonderful commentaries for the games he played and won, which are left to stand as they are. The film does not shy from the stubborn and obstinate side of Seve either, being very fairly balanced in that regard.The film could be enjoyed by anyone, you don't have to know anything at all by golf because it touches on universal themes common to all of us - the determination to succeed, being passionate about something and working at it, how the love of a family can drive you onwards and never, ever giving up. 
tt3149640; Must say, this is just a lovely piece of film-making. Old fashioned storytelling and sweet tale, set within a novel framework which really works.Chronicling Seve's life and using flashback sequences to informative childhood moments, we rise, fall and rise again with this charming character. There humour, a few stakes and a progressing well of sentiment that grows for our hero as the film hits a crescendo of key moments.A life well lived, blessed by genius and determination, cut short by tragedy but ultimately it's eternally hopeful and embracing of a transformative mortal journey that leaves an immortal footprint. Beautiful if a fraction long. 
tt3149640; Having watched the film it shows the greatest players are those who work the hardest. The film is a great inspiration to all that anything is possible and it all comes down to W A N T and how badly you want it! The mix of acting bringing the story of Seve with Seve telling the story of his life gave a great sense of the passion he and his family had and what a great family they all are. Well done to all involved in this film and hopefully in time it gets shown on TV!! Having seen Seve play over many years winning tournaments with that passion that few others have the film takes you back and shows how he grew up and how that passion was born? We see the places where he grew up, Yes the film Is a documentary biography and the sad ending leaves a genuine sense of loss of a great sportsman. What makes this a great film is that mix of story telling but the person who the film is about actually involved in telling his story.The sad ending with Seve actually talking about his illness and his determination and struggle to keep going gave the film a truly emotional ending. 
tt3149640; From the poster this may look like a niche sports film but in reality it's a heartwarming tale about the human condition, taking your chances and forging a way through when the odds are stacked against you.Admittedly, not everyone can do this! Seve was blessed with awesome ability, drive, an engaging charisma and self belief that most people lack. But even if you can't relate you willingly go on this lavish, lovingly told tale from inspiring roots to inspirational super stardom.Equal parts sweet, nostalgic, enlightening, uplifting and ultimately bittersweet, it's well worth checking out even if you're normally put off my golf. I couldn't fault it, especially since it's ably assisted by a gripping score (particularly the theme). I was in from the first beat in tandem with the pounding oars. Bold, beautiful and borne unashamedly of fans. 
tt3149640; I found this such a refreshing doc, brim full of life (produced by its charismatic lead and nostalgic nods to the hero's past) and anchored in a bittersweet reality. It also isn,t afraid to take its time with a slow build that weans you off the drama before delivering a rousing archive-led conclusion. Really could,t recommend it highly enough. My husband and his father recommended it and it certainly played to a female perspective for good old-fashioned story- telling even if the protagonist is a boy's own hero. The music is also wonderful, similarly befitting from a natural simplicity and effortlessly tracking the character arc without ever laying it on too thickly. My takeaways from this movie are two-fold - I will be among the first in the DVD queue whenever it comes out and I will be taking a holiday to Pedrena with my hubby next summer. Stunning visually and an unabashed ode to what makes a remarkable human being 
tt1729674; Overprotective mom Daphne Zuniga (as Rene Allen) doesn't like the blue bikini 18-year-old daughter Brigette Davidovici (as Kaitlin) is packing for their sunny San Diego spring break. Mature-looking 15-year-old brother Nicholas Grava (as Kennedy), who reluctantly has to room with Ms. Zuniga, thinks his sister is "advertising." So, the bikini goesÂ  on the trip. Also along are more lenient best friend Lauren Bowles (as Lisa) and her unquestionably wilder daughter, party-ready Gage Golightly (as Matty). When hunky Brock Harris (as Alex) and other handsome young men mix alcohol with the pretty daughters, the girls get real "Gone Missing". This is a well-performed (especially by a frantic Zuniga) and easy to identify with TV movie. The regrettable "wobbly camera" technique is used effectively. Director Tara Miele and editor Phil Norden are notably good at inter-cutting the flashbacks, as we learn what happened to the missing girls.****** Gone Missing (6/15/13) Tara Miele ~ Daphne Zuniga, Lauren Bowles, Brigette Davidovici, Nicholas R. Grava 
tt1729674; After a rather simple beginning, that appeared to be heading toward a slasher movie in some secluded spring break resort, We are taken on a journey for these Mothers to discover their Daughters true natures, and feelings in a flashback frenzy that somehow is all truthful. That there is the part that fails for the movie as a whole, there is just too much that works out at just the right time for the story to keep rolling. A couple of flashbacks would have worked better with the two stories running in parallel of each other as they finally do get to as the two eventually intersect as they must. This is a well acted movie though with a good cast, and the story even if it is predictable has some good tense moments that are played out well, which is what I Enjoyed the most about the entire production. I recommend this one to Drama fans with Mommy issues, and Mom's who forget that they are not aware of as much as they think they are. 
tt1729674; This is a better than usual Lifetime movie. Two 18 year old girls travel for Spring Break to San Diego accompanied by their mothers, one protective and one lax. From the title you can gather the girls go missing.The dialog is well written. The way people react is realistic and not melodramatic especially the irresponsible mother and daughter. It's a warning for youngsters about choices about drinking, bad boys, befriending strangers and parenting styles. It's a less tragic more common story than what happened to Natalie Holloway and has some useful lessons without being preachy.Daphne Zuniga gives a believable performance and along with Marcia Cross she is one of the better actresses to have emerged from Melrose Place. Liked that she has aged naturally. The actresses who played the girls are quite good too even if you want to give them a slap.Worth watching. 
tt1729674; Excellent movie detailing two mothers on spring break with their high school daughters.One mother is extremely over-protective and the other will allow her daughter to do exactly as she pleases. Both styles of parenting leads to near tragedy when the girls wind up with undesirable guys during a night of drinking and partying.One girl coaxes the other, the daughter of the over-protective mother, to come with her with guys and then leaves her when the other senses trouble.It looks like sure tragedy has happened to our girl, but the mothers join forces to provide a happy ending.The picture is a great one since it deals with over-protectiveness versus a laissez-faire like attitude. Apparently, both can lead to problems. 
tt1729674; What started out as a well-made, relatively large-scale production TV movie quickly became one of the very best movies I have ever seen - in theaters or on television. We've all seen dozens or more movies concerning a child-gone-missing, and a parent's fervent attempts to uncover the mystery and find their child before it's too late. Many times the parents will be looking for their child at the same time the police assigned to the case are doing the same. Uncovering this mystery along with the parent in this film will keep you glued to your seat. The plot is fast-paced and contains a constant series of interesting events, surprises, and plot twists. It's made brilliantly - with flashbacks, real time happenings, and re-tracing of other characters' steps. What starts out almost as a light, breezy, almost comedic movie... soon turns seriously suspenseful as a mother's raw determination to find her daughter takes over in full force.What sets this movie apart by far - very far, is the acting. Daphne Zuniga as Rene gives what is truly an Academy Award performance as an extremely relatable protective mother, searching for the whereabouts of her daughter during a Spring break vacation. She acts EXACTLY like a real mother would in real life. The sheer terror/shock she exudes in the many scenes of discoveries is portrayed with such stark realism and belief... that you feel as if you are watching a documentary of a missing person in real time, witnessing a parent's worse nightmare, as the truths become revealed to her and the story unfolds. Her acting is truly that extraordinary. This movie should have been widely released theatrically so that she is recognized for her powerful acting in this movie.The rest of the cast also deserve exceptionally high acclaim and praise. Lauren Bowles, as Rene's best friend Lisa, brings to new heights the spirit of a parent whose own past mistakes and insecurities makes her an overly-lenient mother, whose daughter actually craves more of her concern and attention. She's the "fun" friend who always tells you not to worry about things and to "relax"... which works 99% of the time, but blows up to disastrous proportions when real trouble hits.Lisa's daughter Matty, played by Gage Golightly, reaches the perfect note as that girl who is always the partier of the group - the one who always wants to have a good time - even if it means sometimes not making the best choices. At times you feel angry and frustrated with her actions in this movie, but then quickly realize how well you understand her, given her upbringing and her own issues. She may not be as confident and carefree as she first appears - and this becomes glaringly apparent when the nightmare of her friend's disappearance begins.Brigette Davidovici, as Rene's missing daughter Kaitlin, is flawless as the "perfect" daughter/sister/friend - who seemingly does everything right, is going through a period of self-discovery herself, while at the same time battling the control and protective issues perpetrated upon her by her mother. It's a situation MANY teenagers today can relate to, and are battling with themselves. So her disappearance makes it that much more realistic... it's extremely frightening and anguishing for the viewers... whether you're a parent, teenager, or anyone else.Special mention should be given to Brock Harris as Alex, a boy that Kaitlin knows. Not many actors can portray drunk scenes with pin point accuracy. It usually is depicted with slurred words and stumbling movements. His actions, however, hit you with stone cold reality... his acting perfectly depicts the type that, when they drink, become a very different person - and you can see it in their eyes. It's a very distinctive and pitch-perfect performance.Everyone involved with the making of this movie should be credited with the highest regard and acclaim. This is not your typical television movie. Your emotions and involvement with this film will run high. And Daphne Zuniga's performance, her raw determinism and NEVER-giving-up persistence, is absolutely terrific on all counts. A mother's true nightmare, acted brilliantly. 
tt1729674; I was not expecting a masterpiece of a film, but it is completely obvious that research was not done before executing this film. Does anyone on the production or writing team know how missing persons cases are handled (aside from being aware that missing persons reports cannot be filed within 48 hours of the person being missing)? As a previous hotel manager, I was appalled at the way the involvement of the hotel security was handled. Generally a guest would not escort a security guard to another guest's room. A hotel guest would never be allowed to review camera footage alongside the security firsthand. Next, the fact that police then became involved, they would not have included the mom in the investigation and interrogation process. This made the film difficult to watch. Getting past these discrepancies, I was extremely annoyed that Lisa (Matty's mom) never really seemed to see the error of her ways. Did she feel it wasn't important to provide some kind of guidance to her daughter ever? Could she not see how her lack of parenting could have caused her daughter's murder or her friend's murder? Despite the acting efforts, this film was not well written or thought out. 
tt1729674; The writers and director have the actors looking west from California to take photographs of a sunrise. I don't think you can do this. I believe the script says the location is Coronado, CA. Is "Pacific Point" a real place? What am I missing here? As long as I've been alive the sun has risen in the east. The actors have given credible performances. The story line is flabby and, aside from a harrowing experience for Mom, the dialogue, photography and character development are uninspiring. I'm not sure what the theme is in this movie. If it is a warning to young people to behave better and use the brains their parents gave them when it comes drugs, alcohol and avoiding handsome guys with no morals, they could probably do better spending Saturday nights for a couple of months observing what goes on in the emergency room of the hospital where I used to work. 
tt0903131; A classic tale of the little people vs the big 'uns. It is set in a community that could be anywhere in rural North America under threat of suburbanization, but happens to be Ontario. This could matter from a box office point of view since it is sufficiently recognizable to Americans as to not need to be seen as a Canadian film.The soulful, moody score from guitarist Bill Frisell helps carry the film forward as the down-on-their luck band of battlers try to fight the rising tide as represented by the billionaire's dastardly son. Sonny Stanton is played so interestingly by Noam Jenkins that you end of sort of liking him anyway. My favorite scene focuses on him getting into deeper trouble losing tons of money at the track.Lisa Ray and Rachael Leigh Cook fight for most delicious horse country babe. Ernie Hudson, Keith Carradine, David Alpay, and Joel Keller, among others, give character performances that provide a fun weft to the scheming warp of counter-scam mastermind played by an understated-but-credible Luke Kirby.Proof that Canadian film can be fun, I greatly enjoyed this film! 
tt0903131; The plot summary on IMDb for this film is more aspiration than actuality. it's overstated and the film doesn't really match the description. Although the film does have some humorous lines and some horses, it is more of a drama than a comedy or western.The acting, filming, and sound are all fine. The film has nice scenic locations and a solid cast of decent actors who seem to do their best with what they're given. Even the overall story had potential.The major problem with this film is that the story elements aren't pulled together as well as they could be. There are multiple on-going story lines but none really go too deep. And, information seems to be missing. As such the film just felt very choppy, a bit of a story here and a bit of a story there and by the end you get a larger, albeit incomplete, picture. Kind of like using high quality silk to make a poorly woven fabric with a bunch of frayed ends. 
tt0903131; This collection of competing clichA©s, pure stupidity and the bizarrely frequent use of "the F word" is quite unintentionally amusing. Writer Brad Smith and director Leonard Farlinger misfire with virtually everything they try to do in this film. However, they flounder and fumble so blatantly and hopelessly that you can have a decent laugh at their expense.The movie begins with Ray Dokes (Luther Kirby) getting out of prison. The problems with the movie begin at the exact same moment because it appears that Ray is actually being released from high school detention. Add in the fact that Ray looks like one the murderers from In Cold Blood who's been time transported to the present day and that the character's emotional range stretches from glum to disappointed to apathetic and you can tell right away this film is going to stink on ice. Ray is picked up by an old friend of his father's, Pete Culpepper (Keith Carradine), a saccharinely stoic farmer who's constantly claiming to be poor, yet still has the financial wherewithal to have his own race horse. Pete even has his own foul mouthed hard ass of a jockey, Chrissie Nugent (Rachael Leigh Cook). Ray and Chrissie almost instantly start screwing each other, even though Ray still pines of Etta Parr (Lisa Ray), his old girlfriend before he went to prison. Etta is also losing her farm and considering that neither she nor Pete ever appear to do any farm work, it's not surprising they're in the same boat.Our villain is the lazy, idiotically scheming Sonny Stanton (Noam Jenkins), who wants to buy Pete and Etta's land for a housing development and also hatches several different nefarious plans involving his wealthy father's race horses. I'm not going to go into any more detail on the plot of this thing because trying to make sense of it gives me a headache. This story is more poorly constructed than a Lincoln Log cabin assembled by a team of feral cats that have had all their legs amputated. Nothing that happens in this film makes a lick of sense.But it's not only that All Hat is a terrible tale. It's also very badly told. Let me give you just one example. One of the most rudimentary techniques in storytelling is to build up the villain as a real, credible threat to your hero. The stronger and more imposing the bad guy, the greater the challenge posed to the good guy. It heightens the drama in the hero's struggle and makes his victory all the more satisfying. That is as basic as you can get for telling a good story. But these filmmakers not only ignore such fundamental principles, they go out of their way to do the exact opposite. Almost every minute Sonny Stanton is on screen, he's insulted, defied, undermined or humiliated by practically every other character. Even the comic relief supporting roles stand up to Sonny and make him look like a fool. That makes Sonny as menacing as a newborn lamb and sucks all the tension and excitement out of a movie that wasn't exactly going to be compelling in even the best case scenario.Now Rachael Leigh Cook is cute as the dickens andÂ well, I was trying to think of another positive element of All Hat but I got nothing'. So, unless you're psycho-sexually fixated on Miss Cook, you can only enjoy this film by making fun of it while you watch. I'd suggest you rent something else instead. 
tt0903131; Saw this on Netflix streaming, pleasant enough small story, with budget production values. Guitar music sound track, static camera angles, stock dialog, stock acting. Filmed in Canada with mostly Canadian actors."Are you an A-hole because you're rich, or are you rich because you're an A-hole?""Why can't we both get along?" "I'd settle for half of that, why don't you just get along?" "I see you are all hat and no cattle." And that is where the title comes from, referring to the dishonest son of the rich horseman in a coma.The movie comes across as more of a "made-for-TV" movie, but R-rated for language. In many ways similar to the 1999 movie with a horse-racing theme, "A Face to Kill For." I have been a Rachael Leigh Cook fan for a long time, I think she is the cutest thing in movies, and she is a fine actress also. Here she plays a hot-headed jockey, Chrissie Nugent.There isn't a lot of benefit to describing the story line here, it involves honest farmers and horse people being badgered by a dishonest son of a horse owner. In the end the good guys come out smelling like roses, while the bad guy gets set up for a big FAIL. Not much to recommend unless you like the actors. 
tt0903131; This is a thoroughly enjoyable movie that has something for almost every one. Two beautiful women, lots of beautiful horses and some really good acting. Add in the conflict between rich & poor or good and evil and it's all there.The fact that it's set in Ontario, my home, is a big bonus. I get so tired of movies made in Canada pretending to be some where in the US.The fact that it was obviously shot in early Fall when the leaves are changing makes every outdoor scene a feast for the eyes and considering this is mainly an outdoor story that says a lot.I went into this not knowing what to expect because I didn't look up the movie before seeing it. I watched it due to the strange name and it finished with me wanting more. 
tt0903131; I don't know what to say about this movie. The first hour and ten minutes were REALLY slow and boring. Twenty minutes in I kept asking myself, "am I going to watch this thing?"Then right at the 1:10 marker when Pauly said to Dean "don't ask questions Dean" it turned around, and became a good warm hearted comedy. From there on, it was pretty good. If the whole movie was like that I'd rate it way higher. But watching a snooze fest for an hour and ten minutes isn't redeemed by 15 minutes of a good ending.So, in the end, it wasn't even average, it was boring, then pretty good. I think a rating of 5 stars is generous. 
tt0069919; Cops and Robbers is an enjoyable, entertaining, and well-acted film. Directed by Aram Avakian, and starring Cliff Gorman and Joseph Bologna as two cops who decided to pull-off the "perfect crime". Filmed in 1973, it's a trip down memory lane, capturing the grit and grime of New York City before it's "make-over" some twenty years later. Gorman and Bologna give their career best performances. Their interactions and conversations seem as real as can be. At no time what-so-ever, do you feel like these fine actors are acting.The movie however is stolen by character actor John P. Ryan as mob-fence "Pastsy O'Neill". Ryan gives an academy award winning performance(he was never nominated), and you truly have sympathy for his character in the end.A really fine work of film-making. 
tt0069919;  A gem of a caper movie, based on Donald (HOT ROCK)Westlake's novel. I discovered this film in the bargain bin of some video outlet near Ft. Bragg, NC ("AIRBORNE!"). I was a little homesick at the time (not having had leave for nearly a year) and I thought I could alleviate some of the pain by kicking back with a few beers and watching a NY-set Seventies flick. Boy, what a find. This is a real sleeper, with easy-going charm provided by the two leads (Gorman and Bologna), suspence, droll wit, and a fine performance by J.P. Ryan as the smooth but treacherous mob fence. The film perfectly captures the mood of NYC in the early Seventies, as seen through the eyes of its ethnic, blue-collar inhabitants. It is not garish, or sleazy, but a fine place to live if it wasn't for that darn crime problem (courtesy of the media-genic mayor-John Lindsay). Catchy title tune by Michel Legrand, gorgeous location photography by David L. Quaid, cameos by Joe Spinell, Frankie Gio, and Frank Adonis. A completely satisfying conclusion. This film will leave you with a smile on your face for hours after each viewing. 
tt0069919; Disillusioned NYC cops Joe (Joseph Bologna) and Tommy (Cliff Gorman) decide their meager weekly salary isn't worth getting killed over and plan a big score. Tommy contacts Mafia kingpin Pasquale "Patsy" Aniello (John P. Ryan) after observing him being booked. In disguise, Tommy finds out that Patsy would pay handsomely for $10 million in bonds. So together the two cops plan to rob a local Wall Street firm during a big parade for the Apollo 11 astronauts.One review here leads off with the line, "A Real Find" and I couldn't agree more. This 70s cop thriller captures both the working man's embitterment with the system and the sleazy side of NYC. Both of the leads are good in their roles and they get fine support from Ryan (has he always been middle aged?), whose lead henchman is played by Joe Spinell. Director Aram Avakian didn't make many films (5 total), but he has a great eye for realism and even a bit of the absurd like the mob using guys on ten speeds during the final chase in Central Park. Filmed entirely in New York City, this really captures the feel of the 70s station house with the green, cracking walls. 
tt0069919;  Two cops have had enough of the 'system' and decide on a high level robbery. This theme is presented in a somewhat light hearted manner.  The film is an effective period piece of New York in the early Seventies.  And of the work-a-day person in general.The video (and current tv version) however...Whatever soulless bonehead was allowed to prepare this movie for video release should be thrown in a lake. The story line is still there.  But apparently the plodding nature of the film prompted cutting and editing.  Many scenes have been awkwardly shortened, re-mixed or completely removed. Hopefully an original copy still exists on the premium cable channels. 
tt0069919; New York City cops Tom and Joe are in the mist of burn out. Why me syndrome eats at them in every way including getting in the wrong lane on the highway. They decide on a bold move to remove themselves from the relentless rat race by stealing and selling security bonds to the mob while remaining untraceable themselves.Cops and Robbers is a very decent suspense comedy overachiever. Lack of star power works in its favor with Cliff Gorman and Joseph Bologna as the two rogue cops as non-descript everydays they ooze New York and are not required to perform acts of cool bravado to protect their careers. They are not master thieves, instead learning as they go along and it's this thin ice approach that gives the film it's well paced balance of humor and suspense. Made during the Serpico era when the NYPD was swimming in corruption it's hard not to root for these dirty cops being squeezed on both sides. It may be a low rent sting but it does have the benefit of bluffing the audience deeper into the final moments than predictable outcomes reserved for superstars like Newman and Redford. 
tt0069919; It's a pretty dumb title -- "Cops and Robbers." Sounds as if it ought to be a gritty urban crime tale starring maybe Steven Segal. Instead it's a good-natured look at two ordinary New York City cops who are tired of the violence and selfishness they see on the job, the greed and perspiration. They dream about getting their share of the goods too so that one of them (Cliff Gorman) can take his family to Bermuda and the other (Joseph Bologna) can become a farmer in Saskatchewan.The cops contact a mafioso (John Ryan) and tell him they want to get out, and they plan on doing it by stealing something and selling it to him for disposal. "What do you plan to steal?" asks Ryan. "Whatever you'll pay two million dollars for," replies Gorman.So they stage a robbery along lines suggested by Ryan, robbing an investment firm of ten million dollars worth of bearer bonds. The man who runs the firm, Mr. Eastpool (Shephard Strudwick) and his secretary (Ellen Holly, a dish) cooperate fully -- and for good reason. Afterward they claim TWELVE million was stolen, stealing the extra two million for themselves. "One million apiece!" Bologna exclaims in disgust. The two don't actually steal anything because they are forced by circumstances to destroy the bonds. But they cheat Ryan out of the two million he agreed to pay, and the film ends with the pair lazing in the back yard of their modest home, smiling and gazing contentedly at an airliner way up there in the sky.The amusement is tempered with a good deal of suspense before and after the robbery as the usual things go wrong and reality intrusions occur.Gorman and Bologna work well together, the former slightly wall eyed and a little insane, the latter cherubic and frightened. In their false mustaches, each looks a little like Groucho Marx. Strudwick and Holly are better than simply good enough, too.Much of the credit must go to the director, Aram Avakian, watching whose documentary, "Jazz on a Summer's Day," was almost as good as being there. Avakian gets a lot of smiles out of events in long shot. (The kids might not get it.) Example: Ryan is having his record typed up for an interview in the police station, looking very very Italian. "What's your name?" asks the cop tonelessly from behind the desk. "Patsy O'Neal," replies the smiling Ryan easily. The cop doesn't bat an eye as he types in, "Anielli, Pasquale." Well, another example, because that last one didn't involve a long shot. A half dozen mafia types wearing shades and flowered shirts are leaning against the wall in front of a high mafioso's headquarters when Ryan's long limousine pulls up. Ryan sits patiently in the car while the armed goons spread out in a circle, like the Praetorian Guard, hands fondling the guns packed into their belts, eyes searching for enemies. Nothing much is made of it but the scene is quite funny. I won't describe any of the other amusing scenes except to say that you have to look for them. The comedy is effective but not outrageous. Nobody falls on his behind, and after the first few minutes there is no shooting.Easy going and diverting film, worth watching. 
tt0069919;  i first saw this flick as a kid back in the late 70s, when i lived in Bergen County, NJ.  my old man worked in manhattan, so i made plenty of trips to NYC, and this movie just perfectly captured the time & place.  Good acting, great story, and some pointed social commentary kept it in my head until i was able to locate a copy on VHS back in the early 90s.  If you like caper/crime/cop movies, this one will keep you interested, gasping, and laughing.   
tt0069919; I'm Born, raised - and still live in NYC.Seeing this movie made me (like a lot of my fellow NYC'ers) pine for those days.It was a great place to grow up - made you 'get with it' really fast.I'd never heard of this film (and I know Mr. Gorman!), so, when it appeared last night on TCM, I recorded it.What a find!The sights and sounds bring back a lot of memories, as does even the film's stock, and the look. All pitch-perfect.The acting's superb. Instead of the (misguided) idea of using 'star' names, the producers and the director went for ACTORS - New York actors. ANd that makes all the difference.The leads, Cliff Gorman and Joseph Bologna are 2 schlubs - cops, who know they're stuck ion a treadmill.They want SOME way to get out - to 'go sit on a beach,' and enjoy their lives.So, through a meeting by happenstance, with a well-known Mafioso figure 'Pasquale Aniello' aka Patsy O'Neill, they think they've found a way to meet their goal.Everyone in the cast is so New York, the director - Aram Avakian - is a born New Yorker, and it really does help give this film that true feel.You can see it in such things like the ways the cops slouch.The little touches - such as the annoying Muzak that plays in a couple of scenes - gives the humor (this IS a comedy) a real NYC feel. It's dry, it's got a 'been there,' jaded quality that is so typical.I join the chorus in praising this little gem.If it shows up - WATCH IT. 
tt0069919; Cliff Gorman and Joseph Bologna star in this movie about two cops who are looking forward to their retirement and want to rob somewhere, but where, for some extra money. (They get paid squat.) One of them goes to a mobster with a proposition in exchange for some information, so that they'll know what and where is the best place. They're told to rob a securities bank for bonds worth a lot of money. But then, there's an unexpected twist.This is a great little film that I thoroughly enjoyed. I was afraid it was going to get really bloody and violent, because it has that feel to it like anything can happen. In fact, at the beginning, there's a fracas that's a little jarring with the yelling and the tension. But essentially we are being shown an average day in the life of a police officer in New York City, from encounters on the street to petty things in the office, which Bologna and Gorman are getting pretty tired of.(Sidenote: It costars Ellen Holly, who was mainly a Broadway actress and made only a few movies and who is known as Carla Gray from One Life to Live as the woman who "passed." I was too young at the time to remember her role, but she was a very beautiful actress.) Getting back to the movie: If you get a chance to see this, which is going to be rare, watch it please. It's a chance to see these stars as cops and as robbers. 
tt0069919; "Cops and Robbers" is an engagingly offbeat caper comedy, written by Donald E. Westlake, about two cops, Tom (Cliff Gorman) and Joe (Joe Bologna) who succumb to the temptation of corruption. They've come to believe that it isn't worth putting their lives on the line for the meager pay that they receive. They strike a deal with a mobster, Pasquale Aniello (the wonderful John P. Ryan) to serve as their fence while they go and steal $10 million in bearer bonds from a securities firm, using a parade as their cover. Westlake infuses his script with a truly unpredictable sensibility and clever dialogue, brought to life by actors Gorman and Bologna whose bantering is believable. You can buy into the friendship of these two dissatisfied Average Joes. Director Aram Avakian keeps things moving along at a good clip, and he and his two talented leads milk each and every scene for its humorous potential. One can't help but wonder how our "heroes" are going to think their way out of the various situations in which they find themselves. One scene that will strike viewers as being rather original is when the car Tom and Joe are driving is surrounded by aggressive cyclists. This also works as another irresistible time capsule of the city of NYC during the 1970s, a decade when it fared very well on the silver screen. The sights and sounds are a pleasure to take in, and the music by Michel Legrand and cinematography by David L. Quaid are prominent assets. The supporting cast is a pleasure to watch, especially Ryan, Shepperd Strudwick as Mr. Eastpoole, and the beautiful Ellen Holly as Ms. Wells, there are noteworthy bits by the likes of Frances Foster, Martin Kove, Delphi Lawrence, Nino Ruggeri, Dolph Sweet, Richard Ward, and Joe Spinell in the role that officially "introduced" him. The interesting finish to this movie juxtaposes happy and sad endings, and we can't help but feel some sympathy for one of the characters. This is clearly not a very well known film, which is unfortunate, but hopefully I and others can help it to gain some more fans. It's a funny, breezy, quirky little piece of work and doesn't overstay its welcome. Seven out of 10. 
tt0051749;  A lot of times I read here by IMBD, that there are only three war-films on the eastern front (Cross of Iron, Stalingrad and Enemy at gates). There are a lot of other european films with this topic and for me this one is the best of all. There are war films better than this, but no one at the eastern front. 
tt0051749; This refers to the English subtitled release of this film.This film deals with a tragic defeat and the destruction of the 6th Army at Stalingrad. It was produced shortly after the German POWs taken at Stalingrad had returned home, so had to deal with a critical and knowledgeable audience. It also walked a tightrope, delivering an anti-war message and condemning German leadership in a country which was sick unto death of finger pointing and criticism.The events in the film take place over more than four months. In order to tell the story coherently, the film shifts focus from narrative to vignette. As the story nears its end, the focus narrows and remains with the troops trapped in Stalingrad, starving and written off by Hitler. All in all, it is well told and the acting is quite good.On the downside, whoever did the subtitles could have done a better job. I speak German and seeing the subtitles while hearing the dialog and knowing a bit of the history created a bit of a dissonance. General Hoth's name is repeatedly written "Hooth", breakout (as in a breakout from the encirclement) is translated as "Breaking ranks," OberLeutnant (1st Lieutenant) is written as "Lieut. Col.", and when von Paulus uses the word Meuterie (Mutiny), it is translated as disobedience. I suspect that those who are familiar with the history of the battle for Stalingrad and military ranks, but who don't speak German, may have a bit of a problem. these problems with the subtitles led me to give this movie 4 instead of 5 stars.Still, the story is well told and survives the translator's bludgeon. I was left wanting a bit more. Few films these days manage that. 
tt0051749; This unfairly obscure early German World War II movie has a lot going for it. For one, it has a solid cast with a lot of recognizable German actors who went on to be in a lot of international productions (namely Preiss and Frank) and put in some solid performances here as soldiers trapped in a hopeless battle.There's a solid share of action with everything on display from the Romanian units crumbling under tank assault to General von Manstein's attempt at relieving the pocket to the bitter street fighting up to the end. Actually the street fighting comes off even better than in STALINGRAD and ENEMY AT THE GATES and feels quite authentic and realistic despite the low budget. Maybe it's because a good share of the actors in the film actually served in the war? I assume the producers were able to find a section of a German city still devastated from the war some 14 years later or else it's some very good set design. Either way I'm impressed. Amazingly, they even managed to round up some real hardware with at least two real T-34's and a PAK anti tank gun for the battle scenes.The film takes the ingenious step of using authentic stock footage to supplement the battle scenes as was possible only back when films were black and white. This trick also worked well in ITALIANI BRAVA GENTE which also managed to often call into doubt whether the combat footage was original or stock.The only main detractor is a lot of mismatched stock footage often from entirely different battles (including some now-famous shots of the retreat from Moscow) and during different times of the year (winter to summer and back again). The film tries to play it off by making it look like snow doesn't hit until after the Russians cut off Stalingrad, but anyone with a basic knowledge of WW2 history should know better. Also the tanks are off, with T34/85's appearing too early in the war as usual and a rare case where an IS2 briefly subs in for a German tank of some sort. Mostly minor nitpicks considering that the film's budget was so low. It's amazing what they were able to pull off with such scant resources. 
tt0051749;  This black&white picture deals mainly with the german armies on the eastern front- starting with all the glamour of third reich parades and the comradeship even in russiaÂ´s tough winters - then finally collapsing into Stalingrad, the major breakdown of all hopes for a german victory...Some of the acting from todays point of view seems melodramatic and the perspective towards General Paulus and other officers in high ranks is a lot different from how historians of the nineties would describe them. The movie gives an impression of a group of men, who keep fighting though they have already lost. I like the movie, still thirteen years was probably too short to get the point really... 
tt0051749; Made soon after the few survivors of Stalingrad returned home, wounds were still fresh & deep when this film was released just 14 years after the unconditional surrender. This film is important because was one of the first German post-war films to critically examine some very difficult & painful areas for the Germans. Interestingly we never see Hitler's face - I'm sure there are a few reasons for that. The film addresses the lie that the Allies of Germany, Rumania (and Italy et al for that matter) were poor troops. They were good soldiers but were indeed poorly equipped & supported.There have been criticisms for mis-matching of stock footage, incorrect tanks (T-34/86 instead of T-34/76) & subtitling. Most of this is minor, for example mistaking "Oberst-Leutenant" (Lt-Col) for "Oberleutenant" (Snr Lt) and mis-spelling General Hoth's name (as "Hooth"). The translating of "break-out" as "break ranks" is trivial. The actual footage spliced in may be of different battles but given the time & place this was made it seems a reasonable thing to do. In the end, getting squashed by a Russian tank or disintegrated by high explosive shells is much the same experience wherever you do it.No, 14 years was not long enough for a deep introspection but this film made a solid start down that path. Well worth seeing. Look out for the exceedingly & implausibly beautiful Sonja Ziemann. 
tt0051749; Hunde, wollt ihr ewig leben Â<U+0096> Dogs: Do you want to live Forever -1959This German war film made just 14 years after the end of World War Two, deals with the Battle of Stalingrad.A German 1st Lieutenant is sent out to be a liaison officer for German intelligence to a Romanian Division, stationed just outside Stalingrad. He quickly learns than the Germans are ignoring reports of a Soviet Army build up in the area. It looks like a major counter-attack is on the way.Of course this happens and the Soviets smash their way through and cut off the German 6th Army and several Romanian units. Instead of breaking out of the trap, the Army stays in place. The Luftwaffe has promised to keep the 250,000 plus men supplied by air. Of course this fails to happen with the weather, Soviet flak etc interfering with deliveries. The Army is slowly starving to death.The film follows the 1st Lieutenant and several of his men has they are drawn into the battle for survival. Their enemy is not just the Russians, but the weather, lack of food and ammo, and the bad decisions of their own High Command.The film features quite a few well done battle scenes among the ruins, as the Lieutenant and his men are killed off one by one. There is also plenty of German and Soviet newsreel footage that is blended into the battle scenes. They likewise use quite a lot of actual vehicles, and weapons from the era, which helps the look of the film.It is well worth hunting this rather unseen war film up, if you are a war film buff.The cast includes, Joachim Hansen, Carl Lange, Horst Frank, Peter Carsten, Richard Munch and Wolfgang Preiss.The director is Frank Wisbar. Wisbar had scored with another German war film in 1957, called, SHARKS AND LITTLE FISH. This one is about the German Navy in WW2. This earlier film starred several of the same cast members. 
tt2069708; "It's OK to ask for help, that's what we're here for." Seth (Davis) is a high school student with no parents, two jobs and two little sisters he is trying to raise. Between getting beat up by the football team and trying to keep the bank away from his home he is trying to find his dead beat dad. Convinced he can do it all on his own he refuses help from everyone, but sometimes it is needed. Going in to this movie I was expecting another cheesy, low-budget Christian movie. I was wrong. While it was a little cheesy I really enjoyed this and Seth is so likable that it is hard not to pull for him throughout. While there are some pretty heavy scenes in this this is a very good family movie that teaches a lot of good lessons for families to talk about. For a movie I just put in so I could get the review done I ended up really enjoying this and I surprisingly recommend this. Overall, much much better then expected. I surprisingly give it an A-. 
tt2069708; When I asked my gang what they thought of this new film starring Kevin Sorbo and Samuel Davis, they unanimously said, "It was different from other Christian films." And they mean that's a good thing. Abel's Field was well written, well acted and entertaining to boot.Among many good messages in this story, I was particularly touched by Seth's dedication to his younger sisters. My kids also pointed this out as one of the things that made Abel's Field stand out. So often, even in Christian media, brothers and sisters are portrayed as annoyances to each other. It was a nice change to see an example of what siblings should be to each other. Allen liked that Abel, the Christian lead in the film, was not a perfect saint. He was portrayed in a very real way that all of us can relate to. Just like the average Christian, Abel was struggling to overcome his past and gain victory over the sin in his life while trying to live out God's will, share the Gospel and be a good example to those in his life. Typically in Christian films we start with someone who is obviously lost and living a life full of sin... alcoholism, adultery, drug addiction, theft, anger... the list goes on and on. As things get worse the rebel comes to the Lord and he cleans up his act at last. In stark contrast, Seth is a good kid, working hard to do good things. His life, even in the absence of parents, is full of great character traits. But he is still lost and in need of a Savior. That is a message our world needs to hear. Even "good" people need to know the Lord. 
tt2069708; It really shows how true to life difficulties Seth and his sisters experience. Abel's reasons for choosing the way he lives, really got to me in that one area of self imposed punishment.It really portrays what it's like to be broken or live life so close to rock bottom. And the process of redemption. Of confession, repentance, forgiveness, cleansing and blessing.I loved the characters of Abel, Seth, Katie and the twins. Well worth viewing.I just wish they showed more of what happens to Abel, after the end scene. I hope there's a sequel. Or maybe a stand alone movie about Abel. 
tt2069708; What a great drama "Abel's Field" is! Released in 2012, the story revolves around 17 year-old Seth (Samuel Davis) whose mother is dead and his father is no where to be found. He's forced to be the parent to his twin 7 year-old sisters. His cold half-brother is following in his father's alcoholic footprints. Seth is bullied at school by the football team and their bossy coach (Richard Dillard), but finds solace with a popular girl at school, Katie (Nicole Elliott), and -- surprisingly -- with the school's loner maintenance man, Abel (Kevin Sorbo).Like all great dramas, "Abel's Field" captivates your attention in the first act and you find yourself in the world of the characters. As the story progresses we discover why Seth is mistreated at school, but it's thankfully not spelled out (it has to do with jealousy, rivalry and sectarianism, the moronic "Your not one of us" mindset). You'll notice, incidentally, that the players only confront & attack as a group and never alone. It's a microcosm of the mob mentality, not to mention they're too cowardly to attack one-on-one.Three relationships are the focus: Seth's fatherly relationship with his sisters and his developing relationships with Katie and the mysterious Abel. Speaking of Abel, Sorbo is excellent here in an atypical role. His likable joie de vivre is completely absent in favor of a quiet, brooding spirit.The message of the film is A+ all the way and the overt references to God and faith are refreshing, but they're not so overt to turn-off those who don't believe, so don't let this factor deter you if you're amongst the latter. This is simply an inspiring film for everyone, except maybe atheists (or perhaps them most of all, lol).Those looking for a faith-based film that shows a conventional family environment might want to steer clear (not that there's anything wrong with those types of films, check out the excellent "Cutback" for a quality film of that sort). "Abel's Field" shows the awful truth of broken & dysfunctional families in the modern Western world and the negative repercussions thereof. Thankfully, that doesn't mean that there isn't any hope, but the proud individualist must be broken, both for Seth and Abel.I also like the fact that the film shows that the mentors we stumble across in life are there to mentor us in one way or another, but we shouldn't make the mistake of idolizing them, no matter how great (or small) the mentor is, he or she is still a flawed human being who just so happens to be further on in their spiritual journey, at least in the area we need help in.Another thing I liked: Just because someone's in the "mentor" role doesn't mean the "mentee" can't mentor the mentor in one way or another. And a worthy (humble) mentor will receive from the mentee when applicable.One reviewer referred to Nicole Elliott, who plays Seth's potential girlfriend, as "overweight." Wow, nothing could be further from the truth, in fact, this isn't even remotely true. Check her out in the film and see for yourself. It's idiotic statements like this that drive women and girls into anorexia and it totally ticks me off! If anything, Nicole could stand to gain some weight. Regardless, she's uniquely beautiful, a refreshing alternative to the stereotypical hot blond cheerleader type.The film runs 104 minutes and was shot in Thrall, TX, which is about 20 miles NE of Austin.GRADE: A 
tt2069708; What a great movie. Very warming. The actors were exceptional. I just have one question. Who was the girl that played Katie. Nicole Elliott? WOW!!!!! what a talent i wonder why we have never seen her before? She is an amazing talent and beautiful as well. Samuel Davis was tremendous as Seth and Kevin Sorbo what can you say he is amazing.I give this picture a 10 star rating.It goes to show you how two completely opposite people can come together to help each other out in a time of need.i will definitely watch this movie again and highly recommend this to anyone else.Keep up the good work Nicole you are on your way to many more movie roles. 
tt2069708; It is very rare that I will give a full ten out of ten for a movie but in "Abel's Field" this is so strongly deserved.A most excellent strong drama something that many of us will identify with the problems that we meet in life and how we cope with them from the eyes of a young guy to an older guy so different but both facing similar situations and able to give support & strength to.The Producers have adapted the script to well, used an amazing small town in Texas called Thrall all real sets and they all add to delivering a great movie.But the two leading actors both deliver first class roles, from the older guy Abel played by Kevin Sorbo who many will recognise from his many party to the young guy Seth, Samuel Davis one of the best upcoming young actors that I predict a great future for. Kevin Sorbo may not have a lot to say but he works so well with Samuel Davis as Seth, Samuel really is spot on with his portrayal of Seth a young guy that many will really identify with and one that you will feel for in his position in life that has come his way.As I started we all look for a second chance so often in life, for that redemption "Abel's Field" is so strong and delivers from start to finish! 
tt2069708; We hurriedly rented this movie as we left a store, without my usual research here on IMDb, and boy am I glad we did! We did not realize there would be a Christian message to this movie, and that was just icing on the cake! This movie kept us engaged throughout, without the preachiness of other movies, like "Flywheel" or "Facing the Giants" and the acting was superb! Loved the acting by "Abel" and "Seth". (We realized BOTH their characters' names were significant when we looked up Seth in the Bible.) My 10-yr.old girl & 14-yr. old boy both really enjoyed this, as did their parents! Great movie...we watched it two nights in a row!! 
tt2069708; I like the real dialog. The awkward moments and the fact that there are families out there that face these situations is unique to see on the screen. There are situations where teens are faced with adult life---times they aren't prepared for. I hope people see this and realize the opportunities they have to love their neighbors and make a difference. Kevin Sorbo does a great job and Samuel Davis has the tools to take the next step in the movie industry. Great watch for families lending to the opportunity to talk about real life moments and how God is there for them. I'm not a huge advocate of the dating model, but this movie is done well. There are no inappropriate scenes to fast forward through and this was refreshing. I recommend the film and will highlight it on my radio show. God will bless through this program. 
tt1486196; I thought this was a really lovely film, romantic, visually beautiful, interesting characters, I especially loved the friendships in the orange grove. An emotionally moving film. It's nice for a change to relax into another way of life and experience a story without guns, crime and action...also the emphasis was on love, can we break through our old pain and begin again. I loved when the male lead went to the US to meet up with the girl again and it ended simply getting out of the cab. There were a lot of suggested ideas, understated dialogue, music carried us and carried on the love between the girl and her father. I also admire the makers of the film for getting the finance independently, not depending on the Australian government, which in my opinion can stick to it's favorites. I wish the director and makers of the movie lots of success. 
tt1486196; Complex characters unfolding. Drawn in with the compelling storyline throughout, like peeling back an onion. Loved the intense depth of characters with beautiful scenery. Understated characters develop with a subdued intensity. Okay, and I just totally was absorbed and really loved it! Can see why it won a major award at Melbourne Film Festival. See this true Aussie movie. Quality is right up there with the quality of any Hollywood intriguing film. Rachel Taylor has yet to tap into her full potential and will be a major star ala Meryl Streep. Alex Dimitriades shows a depth that we just want more and more of. This writer / director put 7 years into this movie and it was well worth his time, effort, and focus. It just all comes together and feels right. 
tt1486196; a beautiful, heartwarming story about a man's struggle with himself and a past that haunts him. We go on a journey with him through twists and turns that we don't really understand until the end. It's a story that slowly pulls the viewer into it's world. The actors all inhabit their roles wonderfully. The lead actor picks up this girl on the road and we think we know how the journey will end until both leads face themselves and what's in front of them right now. No one can escape their pasts and Director Grey takes the time to tell the story in the old fashion way of film making that touches the heart and celebrates the triumph of love and the human spirit. Rachel Taylor is outstanding in all her scenes. The camera loves her and we love her back. We long for her longing and feel her frustration. All the actors are perfectly cast. The location is beautiful. 
tt1486196; The locations and sets, both in and outdoors, create an earthy, transcendent backdrop to this engaging story. A man and a woman have suffered deep emotional pain--hearts aching from loves tragically lost--one in childhood, the other so recent that the pain becomes palpable, yet the heart-warming serendipity they experience with family and friends makes this tale truly satisfying. Camera work, apparently done on a de minimis budget, captures the beauty of Australian orange orchard lands set amidst the bucolic environs of Mildura, Victoria, Australia, creating a deep urge to call Quantas for a flight down under! The Flashbacks that interlace the unfolding relationship of the naturally stunning Heidi with the brooding yet engaging Michael, opened their hearts and souls such that I felt as if two new people had come into my life--at least for one truly enjoyable evening! 
tt1486196; Just saw "Summer Coda" at the Harmony Gold theater in Hollywood. It is a thoroughly enjoyable movie, it's not an action-packed shoot'em up story but a beautifully crafted character study. Rachael Taylor is a real star in the making, and through her chance encounters on her journey we get to meet a group of diverse and lovable individuals. You really like these people and are interested in who they are, what makes them tick and where they're going. It's like meeting new friends and sharing their journey from first frame to last. The photography and settings add color and beauty to a really good film. Friends and family are the building blocks of life as demonstrated in "Summer Coda". 
tt0092130; A Man and a Woman: 20 Years Later/ Un Homme et Une Femme: Vingt Ans DA©jA  is one of those forgotten belated sequels, and generally hated by those who do remember it. The budget is bigger, the plot more expansive, the relationships less tentative, the stunt driving more spectacular and this time the whole film is not only in colour but CinemaScope as well, so on the surface the film only has the characters to really link it to the original, although even they've moved on in life. Aimee's character has become a film producer and, in the wake of a disastrous super-production set during the liberation of Paris that looks like outtakes from Lelouch's own Les Uns et Les Autres/Bolero, has the idea of revisiting her almost love-story in much the same way that after the disaster of Les Grands Moments Lelouch hurriedly produced the original film to stave off the threat of bankruptcy, bringing the pair back together. At first Trintignant's reluctant to give his permission, disappointed that she asked to meet him for the first time in twenty years for a business proposition rather than a romantic one, but his curiosity wins out. Naturally, romance is back on the cards, but neither that nor the film work out quite as expectedÂ  The opening certainly bodes ill, with a horrendous 80s version of Francis Lai's theme giving way to an extended sequence of fast driving stunts and a scene of a power-dressed Anouk Aimee striding through a set filled with hundreds of extras, and it certainly takes a while to get over the change in style. Only one scene really harks back to the feel of the original, as AimA©e's steel dissolves and she briefly becomes the young woman she was twenty years earlier as the two meet in a restaurant and talk about what could or should have been. But otherwise this is a very different animal to the original, with the two characters existing in worlds where the possibility of love is no longer everything and the director obviously torn between revisiting the first film and creating something new as if both desperate to resist the trap of nostalgia but simultaneously in thrall to it.Although generally dismissed as a pointless cash-in, it's actually a neat exercise in semi-autobiographical directorial rumination, reflecting on the original film and what it meant for its participants (characters and filmmakers alike) as much as it does on their love story. It's not exactly Lelouch's 8Â1, but there's a playful sense of indecision about the piece as he throws in a real-life killing involving an escaped mental patient that seems initially gratuitous but later assumes prominence as AimA©e Â<U+0096> and, by proxy, Lelouch Â<U+0096> realises that their original love story simply won't play with a modern audience and changes tack for a more sensationally commercial project. If this seems unlikely, the change in films at least has a historical precedent: Lelouch was so unhappy with Les Grands Moments that, after failing to get a distribution deal, he reputedly destroyed the negative so it could never be seen. Far more unlikely is that AimA©e decides to produce her version of Un Homme et Une Femme as a musical, making this at times feel like one of Jacques Demy's darker films, although it's telling that the audience for Aimee's flop is entirely middle-aged Â<U+0096> Lelouch clearly knows who his shrinking audience is even if he doesn't always know what kind of film he needs to make to recapture a modern mass audience.The last section, with Trintignant lost in the desert with his suicidal lover who wants to take him with her (played by Lelouch's future wife Marie Sophie Pochat while his marriage to Evelyne Bouix Â<U+0096> who plays AimA©e's daughter here - was breaking up) seems like a third movie altogether. Not necessarily a bad one, more a "Where did that suddenly come from?" one, and it's this section that's the film's least satisfying, losing the playfulness and leaving you with the impression that, like the much less satisfying Les Uns et les Autres, this often feels like a series of scenes and plot strands that Lelouch wanted to film thrown together without ever quite finding a resolution. Like many of his films it's by no means a complete success, but it's also by no means the failure it's often painted as Â<U+0096> chalk this one up as an ambitious and intriguingly inconsistent miss, but one that offers a lot more of interest than some of his outright successes. 
tt0092130; Twenty years after their affair, the promoter of the Paris-Dakar race Jean-Louis Duroc (Jean-Louis Trintignant) is called by the producer Anne Gauthier (Anouk AimA©e) to Paris. After producing a movie that was a complete failure in audience, Anne intends to make a movie about their love. Meanwhile, a serial killer escapes from the hospital, and is found dead, together with the wife of his doctor. "Un Homme et Une Femme" is a delightful and charming classic romantic movie. Unfortunately, director Claude Lelouche decided to make this sequel, using the same cast, twenty years later. I do not dare to say that "Un Homme et Une Femme, 20 Ans DA©jA " is a bad movie. However, it kills, for example, the magnificent open end of the original movie, showing what has happened with Jean-Louis Duroc and Anne Gauthier along twenty years. Further, there is a parallel story, and many sub-plots that are completely out of the context, mixing a romantic story with a thriller and a drama. Jean-Louis Trintignant aged too much, and Anouk AimA©e is still very beautiful and elegant, but the wonderful chemistry between them is completely lost. My vote is seven because there are some good points, mainly the filming of the romance of Anne and Jean-Louis, like a movie-in-a-movie.Title (Brazil): "Um Homem. Um Mulher: 20 Anos Depois" ("A Man. A Woman: 20 Years Later") 
tt0092130; Sometimes Claude Lelouch makes good films or masterpieces, sometimes not at all.This sequel of "Un homme et une femme" is useless. It's not a bad movie in itself, because it's well acted, well made and very refined -high quality is a trademark in Lelouch movies. That's why I give 4 stars out of 10...But it's a useless project. Was it necessary to go back to the story and spoil the original picture? The 1966 film is very simple -it's a masterpiece because of that. There are only Jean-Louis Trintignant and Anouk AimA©e, the chemistry is incredible. The film is really poetic, we don't want to know how their love story goes on.In the 1986 sequel we find them 20 years later -Lelouch tells us what they have become and how they meet again. There are other characters and facts which intersect with them.As I said not a really bad movie, but it doesn't stand comparison at all with the original. It would have been better not to produce it. 
tt0092130; In 1966 a beautiful and very artistic film with a very simple story caught the attention of many movie lovers, the romantic and deep "Un Homme et Une Femme", directed by Claude Lelouch and starred by Anouk Aimee and Jean-Louis Trintignant playing the title roles. The movie won the Palm D'Or at Cannes and 2 Academy Awards and was well acclaimed by the public and the critics. 20 years later the same team returned and that return was named properly as "Une Homme et Une Femme, 20 ans Deja" ("A Man and a Woman, 20 Years Later"). The result is quite different of the original film but it has it's good moments and it's full of charm.Jean-Louis (Trintignant) and Anne Gauthier (Aimee) were a happy couple in the 1960's but for some odd reason they split and follow different paths. Both got married with different persons. The former race car pilot married with a younger woman and now he drives in rallies, the actress is now a film producer married with a TV newscaster. Anne and Jean-Louis have the chance to meet each other again when Anne is producing a movie about their relationship and she wants his consent to make the film and remember the good old days, when they met, they got involved with each other and the song of their lives. But their partners aren't satisfied with that meeting and their jealousy might disturb the calm and lovely encounter.OK, many have said that this film was unnecessary sequel, that it's weaker than the original film, that this a waste of time and that sometimes was hard to follow because it has an minor plot that looks dislocated of the movie and only near of the end you understand why the minor plot appeared. My opinion over "Un Homme et Une Femme, 20 ans Deja" is that Lelouch missed a good chance to make a great movie, way better than it is. It looks like a poor sequel of a great film mixed with Truffaut's "Le Nuit Americaine" ("Day by Night"). In Truffaut's movie we see all that happens during the making of a film, the actors relationship and the problems that happens while a movie is made. Same thing here. We don't have the chance to see the emotional changes between Anne and Jean-Louis, we've only seen talking about the film she's making and a little bit of their memories. It could have been like "Before the Sunset" was to "Before Sunrise", the reunion of what a passionate couple and their views on life, romance, marriage, fears, secrets, and other similar things discussed by couples when they split and met again years later. It lacked intelligence here, it lacked humor also. But at least you can see the physical difference between Anne and Jean-Louis. Lelouch alternate a few moments with scenes from "Un Homme et Une Femme" and this film. She's still beautiful, very charming, he looks like a villain taken of some B-movie, with beard, nothing similar to what he used to be, seductive and handsome.Francis Lai's theme music appears here in a Jazz style, way different of the original film but it's still good, a very romantic theme. I liked this sequel because of its nostalgic moments, the city of Paris is beautifully shot, the behind the scenes of Anne's film is very interesting and to see two great talented Jean-Louis Trintignant and Anouk Aimee, they're great together even if the movie is weak. If it wasn't for the scene where Jean-Louis's wife goes crazy in the desert I might give an 10. 9/10 
tt0092130; I have a copy of this film and I do watch it from time to time. While I don't think it's so horrible, I could definitely do without the whole crazy patient/doctor/murder storyline. The rest of the movie, I like.It's interesting to see Jean-Louis and Anne interacting with their now grown up children and to see what paths their lives took after their very brief fling. I think the chemistry is still there between them, and I think they actually look like real middle aged people, not the "perfect plastic botox people" that we so often see in today's films...I gave this film a 8 out of 10 because(despite it's flaws)it was nice to catch up with the lives of Jean-Louis and Anne. 
tt0092130; Sequels to films that made an impact when they first came out are usually a let down. If we enjoyed the original, our perception on the update will probably not be as kind as when we discovered a particular movie for the first time, although there can be exceptions.That seems to be the case with this film which we never saw when it was released. Claude Lelouch surprised the world with a story that was fresh, had two of the brightest stars of that era, and had a wonderful music score by Francis Lay. Unfortunately, for this second view at the same characters twenty years later, there are no surprises, other than the reunion of Anne and Jean-Louis as they looked twenty years later.Anne and Jean-Louis who loved each other passionately, now are seen as middle aged individuals that are reunited after their break up, which by the way, it's never made clear why it happened, or how their passion fizzled after what one thought would be a match made in heaven. Anne, a film producer, is going through a bad period in her career. She feels the love story she experienced with Jean-Louis merits to be brought to the screen. For that purpose, she contacts him. Jean-Louis, now involved in a relationship with a younger woman, is skeptical of what Ann wants to do.Mr. Lelouch introduces another element. Anne, being a producer, is supervising a war epic, as the film starts. The reviews are terrible. Then, she embarks in the making of another drama. The director shows the way movies are done as most of the characters lives revolve around the different sets of films in production. It is a distracting theme that adds nothing to what one thought would be the only reason for the remake of "Une homme et une femme" in the first place.One thing did not change. Anouk Aimee shows in her mature ravishing beauty, as she lights up the screen whenever she appears. Jean-Louis Trintingnant does not fare as well. He is more of an enigma, we never warm up to him. The film disappoints because one feels manipulated by the director who brings us along with the promise of watching a relationship that went sour, fix whatever problems that got them apart, in doing so, Mr. Lelouch wastes about forty minutes of celluloid before showing the lovers together at long last! 
tt0092130;  Having exquisite memories of the first film, "A Man and a Woman", I looked forward to seeing the sequel, "A Man and a Woman: 20 Years Later."Yes, there were the famous faces and superb actors (Aimee and Trintigant), looking very little the worse for wear, in other words, wonderful.  So expressive, both of them, in facial expression, mood expressions and fantastic acting. However, they are in a losing vehicle, with this film. It is so unmoving, that it relies on several subplots to impart to it some action.  Hardly fair to two such stellar actors! They deserve better. And the viewer, alas, deserves better. I am, however, grateful for small things - and if seeing those two magnetic characters again thrilled and elated me...what's a plot? Yes, I would recommend it to any viewer who feels as I do about great actors. Just don't look for anything more, simply bask in their respective glows. Hence, my title: A Bittersweet Viewing Experience.  
tt0092130; If you saw "Un Homme et un Femme" and loved it, do yourself a favor and don't watch this one.I believe Lelouch needed a few extra bucks because this film ruins the story of the first. Did we need to know what happened to Anne and Jean-Louis 20 minutes after the first movie is over? Not really.And even if you consider this film alone, its still a very boring flick. And pointless. The story makes too many detours with their every day life: what they do now, how they evolved, and constantly needs the support of the first film to make a little sense. At the end of it, one is left with a bitter aftertaste of having betrayed the beautiful first story. Second parts are seldom good, and this movie proves it perfectly. 
tt0092130; Often it goes like this - big love come into existence and it is unshared. Often it goes also like this - the feelings between (at least) two lovers are not the same and start at a different point.People say that is harder for the man to live through separation rather than a woman. He felt it in the beginning weakly but with time the lack becomes a pain and the pain - in crisis. It was absolutely opposite for the woman. In the beginning she felt awfully but with time compared to man she got on her feet in searching another rogue.For good or for bad this movie makes this stereotype in pieces by showing the more realistic variant of a such possible experience. Was it because of the refinement of a cinema woman and (surprisingly) of a race driver or it was because of the soberness of the producer - this is what I do not know - but the movie was very real, charming, romantic till its end. Was it because of the samba of Vinicius or because the love of a blond - this is what I do not know.Both protagonists, step back in front of the ambition to take main role in life, find equal language which lead them to the natural end of such adventure. But right then, the feelings which run through us, guiding us as we are their marionettes take part, the feelings of which we are slaves. With them the expected end becomes hard to be predicted.What about twenty years later? Who knows? Who knows where will lead us our life path. Will it make clear our desires or will present to us new ones. In every case such a try to predict this end grows pale in front of the present intensity of sensual forgetfulness and dottiness but stays very good model of thinking plots, real or not.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/ 
tt0092130;  The movie begins badly, with some racing scenes that go on for so long you may start thinking you're watching a James Bond flick. Then it wastes some more time by following the characters in their everyday activities, which are of little interest. But when the couple from "A Man And A Woman' is finally reunited, Lelouch shows that he still hasn't lost his touch when it comes to quiet dialogue scenes, in which expressions speak as loudly as words. And the idea of filming a movie ABOUT the story we saw in the first movie makes for an intriguing re-examination of the original from an unusual perspective - the perspective of the fictional character who starred in it. But Lelouch still can't stay concentrated on the things that really matter, and even when he later introduces a new, completely unexpected story thread (the "adventure" in the desert), he keeps intercutting it with another film-within-a-film, which is boring and pointless. The final impression is that of a film with many good things in it, but also a whole lot of flaws.     (**1/2) 
tt0072236;  Perhaps Tarantino has started the trend of justifying the legitimate place for trash-films in serious movie history. Jack Hill is definitely a one-of-a-kind filmmaker, an obvious maverick who managed to squeeze as many entertaining moments as he could out of his tight budgets (the fact that Roger Corman fired him more than once shows that Hill was a handful, but never seemed to let up). SWITCHBLADE SISTERS is a hoot, as is FOXY BROWN and THE BIG BIRD CAGE. This film, THE SWINGING CHEERLEADERS, while not as good as other Hill films, has some of the touches that made his previous films successful.The cast is great. Hill was good at finding attractive women to embody his screen characters, and the knockouts here include Colleen Camp and Cheryl (Rainbeaux) Smith. The plot is some silliness about a female reporter infiltrating the cheerleadering squad at Mesa University to get the scoop. Her boyfriend turns out to be a real jerk, and the eventual outcome is a confrontation with the snooty Camp and some pretty ridiculous bad guys.The film copies some of Corman's nurses movies (political conscious, making sure the token African-American character is there.)Yet, the film also seems to be parodying these more serious-minded New World pictures. SWINGING CHEERLEADERS is fun, and a reminder of what drive-in films were like (most exploitation films nowadays are not this fun).Jack Hill---the man, the movies... 
tt0072236;  In order to get an expose, an aspiring reporter (Jo Johnston), joins the cheerleading squad only to learn not to pre-judge people. Of the 3 movies in Anchor Bay's Cheerleader set (the Cheerleaders, Revenge of the Cheerleaders, & the swinging Cheerleaders), this one feels most like a movie. Yea, nearly all the cheerleaders shed their clothes at one point or another, but there's a little helping of social commentary to go with the exploitation. It's a bit easy to see that this is a Jack Hill directed picture and it's better because of it.My Grade: B-DVD Extras: Commentary, 2 TV spots, Jack Hill Bio  
tt0072236;  Remember when they used to show films like these late at night on cable in the eighties and it seemed so daring.  High camp film that has now been put on the Tarentino pedestal of high art and I'm not arguing. Lots of sex, polyester, and actors you know are matrons who cringe when they look back at their youth. 
tt0072236; A feminist type writer goes undercover to expose what goes on in the cheerleading squad, but ends up siding with the group.I didn't really like this movie. I didn't like the characters or the story. I think the one subplot that interested me was the student having an affair with a professor, but it got the least time.I did like the fact that the newspaper editor who was supposed to be progressive was actually slimy, while the football player who was supposed to be dumb was actually a nice guy. I don't really remember how it ended, but it probably had to do with the administrator and coach getting busted for trying to rig the big game for their own benefit.Uninteresting and forgettable. And the people in the movie were really ugly, too. 
tt0072236;  The last time I saw this movie was in 1991 on USA "Up All Night" and I haven't seen it since. I first saw it in 1983 on cable when I was 12 years old,I had to sneak downstairs in the middle of the night to watch it,because it was a "dirty movie". Those were the days. It may be cheesy as hell,but I like it. I noticed that Colleen Camp is in this,and no, there are no nude shots of her. One thing I've wondered about this is what type of movie this is: Comedy? Drama? Action? I think it's all three. I miss this movie and I wish it was available on VHS. I see SWITCHBLADE SISTERS is! Why isn't this one?! SWINGING CHEERLEADERS is way better than SWITCHBLADE SISTERS!  
tt0072236; The prolific Jack Hill directs an exploitation feature this time focusing on cheerleaders and a football scandal..now this is what I seek out for my entertainment. The story-lines(..there are a series of plots focusing on certain cheerleaders and their love lives)aren't that challenging, just simple basic scenarios wrapped up in a tiny bow at the conclusion.Mesa College Dean, Head Football Coach, and a Math Professor all take part in a betting scheme, fixing numbers in regards to scoring during football games since the team is so talented. An underground college reporter, working on a major assignment for her term paper, decides to join the cheerleader squad to find dirt for it. Joe Johnston is Kate, the sexually liberated reporter who finds herself befriending her fellow cheerleaders, falling in love with the All American quarterback stud, Buck Larson(Ron Hajek) in the process. Buck is the boyfriend of head cheerleader Mary Ann(Colleen Camp), the prim, proper(..and quite naive)daughter of Mesa's Dean. Mary Ann doesn't have a clue that her man is banging all kinds of chicks on campus. Other sub-plots include virginal Andrea(Cheryl Smith)giving her football wide receiver boyfriend a hard time with her sexual hang-ups and cheerleader Lisa(Rosanne Katon)conflicted due to her affair with her married Professor Thorpe(Jason Sommers). Kate must contend with her deteriorating relationship with a campus radical who gets revenge on her, exposing the ditched article on cheerleader exploitation, raising the ire of her colleagues.I admittedly enjoy this kind of 70's drive-in fare, and as expected Hill understands how to deliver for this market. While the stories are soap opera in college kind of material, at least there was an effort to incorporate social themes reflecting that period of time. There's plenty of crude sex comedy humor throughout which means Hill done his homework. Hill mentions on the audio commentary that he hated football and didn't know that much about it, but I commend his ability to evoke the atmosphere of this particular setting, establishing how the sport could be used for behind-the-scenes crooked activities. Johnston(..I'm quite shocked this was her only performance)is quite appealing as the central character who stirs the pot and Cheryl Smith is beautiful / vulnerable as the dim bulb Andrea without a clue regarding the methods of passionate love-making. I love me some Colleen Camp and she's a fox, looking mighty fetching in her cheerleader uniform. There's some nudity sprinkled throughout, but Hill cuts away before sex commences. 
tt0072236; Okay, this is my second cheerleader movie in a row I'm reviewing having previously commented on The Cheerleaders. In this one, Jo Johnson is Kate, an aspiring reporter who joins the college cheer team to expose them for their sexual hijinks but ends up finding out about a corrupt fix involving the football games. Ms. Johnson is quite a sexy brunette here surrounded by a blonde Colleen Camp as Mary Ann, another blonde Cheryl "Rainbeaux" Smith as Andrea, and a female of color Rosanne Katon as Lisa. Yes, there's some sex scenes with the requisite nudity and some funny lines and sequences but there's also some nice dramatic ones concerning much of the plot I mentioned. If I hadn't read the credits on Wikipedia and this site, I would have been fooled this was actually written by two women but it's actually two men as one of them is really director Jack Hill (as "Jane Witherspoon"!). Still, it sometimes felt like there was a feminist spin in some of the scenes and I liked the way the tone changed partly on a dime. So on that note, I recommend The Swinging Cheerleaders. 
tt0072236; Needing another member for the cheerleading squad at Mesa State College the cheerleaders open tryouts for anyone who might be interested. As it so happens a student by the name of "Kate Corie" (Jo Johnston) auditions and is accepted even though the head cheerleader "Mary Ann Putnam" (Colleen Camp) is jealous of her for flirting with her boyfriend "Buck Larsen" (Ron Hajak) who happens to be the star quarterback. What nobody knows however is that Kate only wants to join the squad to dig up some dirt for her journalism term paper. And in the course of her work she discovers a lot more than people fully realize. Anyway, rather than divulge anymore of the plot and risk spoiling the movie for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this particular film had a reputation for being somewhat sleazy when it first came out. However, while it certainly had some nudity and scenes of a sexual nature, it wasn't nearly as graphic as I had initially thought back then. Likewise, although it was definitely a low-budget drive-in type of movie that one would find back in the mid-70's, it had a fairly interesting plot which managed to keep my attention for the most part. At any rate, while it certainly wasn't a blockbuster film by any means it wasn't that terribly bad either. Accordingly, I give it an average rating. 
tt0072236; It's amazing how this movie made me realize how fond I actually was of the first movie "The Cheerleaders". It was trash but really entertaining and fun trash. I just can't say the same about this sequel.I just never really had any fun with this movie. It doesn't really has comedy in it, or at least not of the funny kind. It just isn't as fun or clever written as the first movie. As a matter of fact, you could even say that this movie is bit overwritten, as strange as that perhaps might sound. With that I mean, is that the movie takes itself and its story a bit too serious. This movie didn't needed to have a main plot line in it! It should had been about silly teenagers, doing silly teenagers stuff, all sex related.But you can't even really call this a sexploitation flick. Really, it has far too little sex and nudity in it for that. Like I said, it's just too heavy on its story, which does not suit the genre at all. Another reason why I really wasn't taken by this movie was because it was lacking some good, or likable enough, characters in it. This is something the first movie did really right! Every character had a very distinctive personality and was often very likable because of that. In this movie I still can't tell you who is who in it. All I remember is that one of the guy's name was Bucky Larson.It's not exactly the worst movie I have ever seen, also not within its genre but it's still a very lacking- and a just not fun enough movie. Just stick with the original!4/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ 
tt0072236; So I sat down to watch this expecting a waste of 90 minutes of my life. Surprisingly I found myself actually enjoying this seedy little mid seventies sexsploitation piece.The plot is nothing to speak of - journalism major decides to do a piece on swinging cheerleaders and their jock boyfriends.Where the film surprises is in it's scripting - surprisingly liberated considering this was 1974 and somewhat witty with a bevy of interesting performances from a game cast, this turned out to be far more entertaining than expected.Fun seventies drive-in fair and somewhat more layered than you may think. A solid six out of ten. 
tt0050680; Universal International's MAN IN THE SHADOW is a modestly entertaining thriller! Produced in 1957 by Albert Zugsmith it was adequately written for the screen by Gene L. Coon and was crisply photographed in black & white Cinemascope by Arthur E. Arling. Also known as "Pay The Devil" it was directed in a fine workmanlike fashion by the king of the B movies Jack Arnold. Now the picture has just recently been released on DVD in a splendid and sparkling widescreen transfer which in itself is something of a surprise since the movie isn't that well known or that well appreciated. But one could suspect that the reason for its DVD appearance is the presence in the cast of the great Orson Welles who takes second billing to the picture's star Jeff Chandler. Welles' part in the movie isn't very distinguished. In fact it isn't distinguished at all and could have been played by any one of a dozen Hollywood character actors such as Charles Bickford, Robert Middleton, George MacReady etc. One could further suspect that Welles took up the assignment simply to woo Universal so they would back him the following year when it came to producing his masterpiece "Touch Of Evil". Whatever the reason the great actor here just chews up every bit of scenery there is and acts the socks off everyone around him.Spurline is a quiet little modern cow town in the south west were nothing really very much happens until one day the local sheriff Ben Sadler (Jeff Chandler) gets a complaint from an old Mexican farm hand (Martin Carralaga) that his young friend and co-worker, at The Golden Empire ranch where they both work, has been beaten to death by two of the ranch foremen (John Larch and Leo Gordan). The Golden Empire is a ranch of gargantuan proportions - "Why sheriff there are some countries in Europe not as big as this ranch" stoutly declares its owner the powerful Virgil Renchler (Orson Welles) who doesn't take too kindly to Sadler when he comes to see him about the young farm hand's death. He threatens and intimidates him and not only that but the town council also want Sadler to cease his investigation so as not to compromise Renchler's investments in the town. But Sadler is not for turning and continues to probe resulting in two attempts on his life. The picture ends when after been dragged through the streets of Spurline on the end of a rope a badly beaten Ben Sadler arms himself and with no one to help him goes to The Golden Empire to arrest Renchler and his cohorts. But Renchler's men overpower him and just as they make plans to kill him the town's leading citizens, with changed hearts and minds, arrive to help their sheriff arrest Renchler and his men.Of course the acting honours goes to Welles. As the all powerful and brash land baron he just runs away with the movie whenever he's in it. Regrettably though Jeff Chandler is as wooden as ever complete with irritating facial expressions, that camera conscious manner and that affected gait when he walks. But there is some nice playing from a good supporting cast like Martin Carralaga as the old bracero, Paul Fix and William Schallert as members of the town council, John Larch and Leo Gordan as the killers, the attractive Coleen Miller as Renchler's daughter and there's a fine cameo from James Gleason as a guest of the county who sleeps it off every night in Sadler's jail cell. Also of note is the splendid score contributed by Hans Salter and Herman Stein both of whom shamefully go uncredited as was the norm for a Universal picture of the period.MAN IN THE SHADOW is by no means a great movie but it's a handsomely mounted black & white Cinemascope offering which flows quite comfortably with Arnold keeping a tight rein on the proceedings. So to sum up there are worse ways one could spend 83 minutes. 
tt0050680; With the debate over illegal immigration and the concern that it is mostly coming from south of the American border, Man in the Shadow is a film that has assumed a serious relevance for us today.Jeff Chandler is the sheriff of a small southwestern town and a Mexican migrant worker, Martin Garralaga, has brought news of a homicide committed by white ranch hands on the property of his employer Orson Welles. It seems that a young Mexican was paying to much attention to Welles's daughter, Colleen Miller, and Welles wanted to teach him the error of his ways. Of course Leo Gordon and John Larch go too far and now a murder has to be covered up.It becomes two murders when witness Garralaga also turns up dead. Though Welles and his Golden Empire Ranch have a stranglehold on the local economy and the town's leading citizens beg Chandler not to pursue the case, Chandler doggedly goes ahead anyway. He's the sheriff and it's his duty.Chandler in this modern western is a standup straight arrow sheriff in the mold of Gary Cooper or John Wayne. He takes his oath of office quite seriously. And what happens to him during the course of the investigation makes the townspeople want to re-examine just how much they want to kowtow to Welles and his hired thugs.Mario Siletti, the town barber and one of the few who backs Chandler without reservation, puts it best in that his father fled from a guy who was running Italy in the Twenties the same way Welles was running this corner of the USA. Orson Welles just by his appearance in what is a B picture lent enormous prestige to it. This was one of those acting jobs he did trying to earn money to finance his own projects. But Welles never gave less than 100% of himself in anything he did. His portrait of a malevolent Ben Cartwright is a great piece of work.Man in the Shadow played the bottom of double features in the Fifties, but those who saw it were not disappointed. 
tt0050680; Seems like shapely actress Colleen Miller appears outside her regular clothes about as often as in them, as in nightgown and underwear. But then, the movie posters had to have something provocative to promote.The premise itself has been around the block more than a few timesÂ<U+0097>a reluctant lawman stands up to local tyrant despite opposition from frightened townspeople. Still, the movie works pretty well up to two points where the screenplay bucklesÂ<U+0097>the rope dragging and the town turn-around. Neither of these is very believable within context. But then, the film is on a budget and does have to motivate a wrap-up.I gather producer Zugsmith helped finance Welles' next feature Touch of Evil (1957) in return for appearing here. The part is relatively small, and Welles underplays without the needed malevolence. Seems almost like he's walking through. Nonetheless, it's a solid cast of supporting players, familiar faces from thuggish Leo Gordon to Dragnet's Ben Alexander taking a break from the LAPD. The support works well to provide more color than usual. Rather sad to see that earnest actor Jeff Chandler again, knowing he died unnecessarily at 42 as result of medical malpractice (a foreign object left inside following an operation, as I recall). He's quite good here as the conflicted sheriff struggling to do his duty. All in all, it's a decent enough programmer, better than Zugsmith's usual quickie fare, thanks in large part (I expect) to under-rated director Jack Arnold. 
tt0050680;  Often mistaken as a Western, this little ranch-set, (then) modern-day murder tale has ambitious themes, but fails to resolve itself with much of an impact.  Orson Welles was seen to possibly his best effect onscreen in 1958 with his masterpiece Touch of Evil and his great, scenery chewing Southern patriarch in The Long, Hot Summer.  Here he's barely given anything to work with, and Jeff Chandler's solid work doesn't produce a memorable character. Good atmosphere, interesting potential, but a disappointment. 
tt0050680; This is a good "pre-civil rights movement" western, continuing in the tradition of "High Noon" and "Bad Day at Black Rock". Colleen Miller plays Orson Welles daughter, (not his wife as someone posted previously.) Jeff Chandler (who died way too young at 42) is the sheriff and conscience in the film and he does a good job in this role. The fact that the cowboys have beaten a defenseless Chincano to death is something that most citizens in the town would rather forget.Chandler's character and his family are harassed by the murderous and prejudiced cowboys who work for Welles.The climax of this film is hard to watch even today. The director was Jack Arnold,who was great at expressing his opinions in low-budget films,such as "It Came from Outer Space" and "The Tattered Dress." 
tt0050680; MAN IN THE SHADOW Â<U+0096> 1957This Universal Studio's production is sort of a western updated to 1957. We have Orson Welles as the big land owner, Colleen Miller as his daughter and Jeff Chandler as the local Sheriff. The film is set in the American Southwest.The film starts on Welles' Golden Empire Ranch. A young Mexican farm hand, Joe Schneider, is dragged out of one of the ranch bunkhouses by two men, John Larch and Leo Gordon. They take Schneider to a nearby shed where they start to work the lad over. It seems that the young man has been over friendly with ranch owner Welles' daughter, Miller. Welles sent the two men to teach him a lesson. Schneider however is a stronger go than Gordon and Larch expected. A handy pick axe handle soon ends the fight by splitting the lad's skull open. Watching this whole thing from the shed window is, Martin Garralaga. Garralaga is another one of the many Mexican farmhands employed by Welles' ranch. He fades back into the dark and returns to the bunkhouse.The next morning, Garralaga decides to pay a visit to the law in the local town of Spurline. Spurline is a small one horse town with just a Sheriff, Jeff Chandler and one deputy, Ben Alexander. The town survives on the business it gets from Welles "bigger than some countries" Golden Empire Ranch.Garralaga tells his story to Chandler and Alexander. Alexander does not believe the "wetback" and urges Chandler to do the same. No point in rocking the boat with Welles without any proof. Chandler, newly elected, tells Alexander the law applies to everyone. He will go out and at least see if the young man is still there.Welles, who takes security serious, has armed men at the entrance to his property. After Welles has his men let Chandler in, Chandler politely asks about a possible "disturbance" on the ranch the night before involving a Mexican farmhand. "I have hundreds of wetbacks working here. You think I keep track of them all?' "Probably a couple of them got drunk and got in a fight." Welles also broadly hints that if Chandler wishes to keep his job, he best drop the matter. Chandler knows he'll need to dig up more evidence before pushing the matter. Back to town he goes to have a further talk the witness. Welles had only ordered his thugs to rough up Schneider. But since it ended up in murder, he is as guilty as Larch and Gordon. He calls the two into his office where they come up with a way to end the matter. Gordon takes the body of the slain young man down to an isolated spot on the highway. He dumps the body and then drives over it several times. He then contacts the Sheriff's office. He claims that the lad must have been drunk and wandered out into traffic. Deputy Alexander has no problem taking this story as gospel. When Welles' daughter, Miller, hears about Schneider's death, she contacts Chandler. Schneider and Miller had become friendly. Miller figures it most likely upset her father. Chandler adds this to the growing list of evidence. He decides to take precautions with his witness, and hides Garralaga at the farm of Royal Dano. Welles continues to stir the pot as he contacts the town managers, Paul Fix and William Schallert, and threatens to take his ranch business elsewhere. The less than subtle hint, "Get rid of Chandler or else". Welles' men also sabotage Chandler's Police car. Chandler is lucky to escape the wreck with only a few bumps and bruises. Besides the pressure from the town council to lay off the investigation, Chandler's wife, Barbara Lawrence is getting threatening phone calls. Add to all this is that the witness to the murder, Garralaga is himself murdered. This of course just makes the Sheriff all the more determined to solve the case.Welles now pulls out all the stops and has two of his men, Leo Gordon and Charles Horvath, jump Chandler. They lay a solid beating on the man and then drag him through the town streets from a rope tied to the back of a pickup. The message, Welles is really the man in charge. Chandler, who has been patched up by the local doc, Harry Harvey, has had more than enough. He arms himself with a shotgun and roars off to confront Welles at his ranch. The townsfolk, shamed by letting Welles walk all over them, arm up and likewise set off for the ranch. Needless to say there is a showdown at the ranch with several of Welles henchmen eating far too much lead than is good for them. Welles is slapped in cuffs and loaded up for a trip to jail. This one comes off as an upper level b-film, not great, but quite watchable. Welles is good as the old style land baron type. Chandler, is Chandler, he does nothing different here than we've seen in a dozen other films. Colleen Miller is more or less simply eye candy.The director, Jack Arnold, is best known for a series of great sci-fi films he made in the 1950's. These include, IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE, CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON, REVENGE OF THE CREATURE, TARANTULA and THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN. He touched on noir with, THE TATTERED DRESS and OUTSIDE THE LAW. He would end his career helming episodes of THE LOVE BOAT. Some nice black and white work is supplied by Oscar winning (The Yearling) cinematographer, Arthur E Arling. Arling also received an Oscar nomination for his work on, I'LL CRY TOMORROW. The following year, Welles would make, TOUCH OF EVIL. 
tt0050680; The law in the nineteen fifties was straight forward enough, if you happen to be white. Minorities on the other hand were lucky if ever there were men behind the badge with the willingness to stand up to wealthy, powerful men. This 1950's film was directed by Jack Arnold and written by Gene L.Coon. It depicts the story of Ben Sadler (Jeff Chandler) the town's sheriff, who is informed of the death of Jesus Cisneros (Martin Garralaga), an immigrant worker or 'Bracero' who is murdered by two ranch hands. From the moment the sheriff begins his investigation into the murder, he is besieged by local town's people of the danger of taking on Mr. Virgil Renchler (Orsen Wells) the most powerful man in the state. Still, Sadler is determined to bring the two men to justice. John Larch, Royal Dano, Paul Fix, Leo Gordon and William Schallert are among the most notable actors who give life to this otherwise Black and white picture. The acting is good and so too is the dark drama, which allows the movie to be interesting. Chandler gives a powerful performance and shows why he became a popular staple of the era. **** 
tt0050680; Like "Bad Day at Black Rock" this is a modern western, and also someone tries to throw the hero's car off the road. Like "High Noon" it tells the story of a sheriff that goes against the whole town's opinion to face the bad guys. Like "The Man From Laramie" the hero is dragged, but by a pick up truck and not by a horse. Like "On the Waterfront" even though he is badly hurtÂ etc. etc. "Man in the Shadow" is a good film, it grabs your attention. Jeff Chandler is excellent as the sheriff and Orson Welles is great as always. It could be a very good film if it would not be for the fact that specially on the last half you feel you are seeing something that you have seen before. 
tt0050680; its basic virtue - honesty. it is a correct film, in moralistic skin, with western nuances but more than a story about fight between good and bad. its great chance - a smart script, almost courageous, an exceptional cast - the duel between Orson Welles , master of so many nuances of his role, and Jeff Chandler is realistic, the tension of scenes is real gem and the references to ordinary reality represents perfect catch for each viewer. its definition - measure. art to reflect a face of America with universal resonance. and this is cause , one of them, for who it is more than a nice old movie. far to be moralistic, it is a beautiful story about values and their soul - pure courage of a Medieval hero in the womb of a small town reality. and, for a viewer from East Europe, the year of film production is interesting remember about Cold War atmosphere. like a not great significant detail. 
tt0050680; Not a bad B Western set in the modern little town of Spur Branch (or whatever it is). Jeff Chandler is the sheriff but the town is ruled by Mister Big -- Orson Welles, growing ever bigger -- from his ranch, The Golden Empire. Welles has a few hundred braceros working for him. He himself is surrounded by goons of varying degrees of terpitude. There is no question of who makes the rules in Larkspur. It isn't Chandler, sitting with his feet on his desk.Welles has a comely daughter, Colleen Miller. She doesn't have much of a part to play in the movie, except that she sets the plot in motion by dating one of the Mexican laborers and infuriating her father, who has the young man beaten to death. The director, Jack Arnold, who made some fine science fiction movies, is gracious enough at least to give us a glimpse of Colleen Miller in her lingerie. She looks better than a giant tarantula although her acting is at about the same level.Anyway, an old Mexican shuffles into Sheriff Chandler's office with a tale of having seen Miller's boyfriend get his skull split by an axe handle (in a particularly vivid piece of writing). Chandler treats him as a nuisance. There may be something to the story but why stir things up? With the exception of Mount Spur's Italian barber, Santoro, the rest of the town concurs. These Beaners can never be trusted.But when the old man who reported the incident ALSO turns up dead, Chandler becomes a bit more animated. What in the world is going on in Spurmont? Some shenanigans out at the ranch? Chandler is visited by the town leaders who urge him to ignore the whole mess. If he alienates The Golden Empire, Welles will just take his business elsewhere and Spurville will suffer a decline in economic advantages.Faced with insults from Welles, threats from his henchmen, the disapprobation of the public, and slavering growls from an unfriendly German shepherd, does Chandler relent? Are you kidding? This kind of movie can end in only one of two ways: the sheriff takes on the fight alone and wins ("High Noon") or he's rendered helpless by the miscreants and the town finally finds its spiritus and bands together to rescue him. One of these solutions applies here.It's not badly done. By that, I mean that it deals with racism, of course, but it doesn't hit us over the head with it. There is only one preachy speech by Chandler and it's mercifully brief. But the movie has its weaknesses too. The general level of the performances is poor. The townsmen have little motive for their determined change of heart at the end. Welles loves his daughter but, that aside, the evil guys are pure evil, as in a child's cartoon.I believe the plot itself is recycled. Maybe it's been recycled several times before. Mister Big on his ranch on the outskirts of Spur Valley calling the shots until one of the citizens gets all noble. The racial overtones aren't all that common, although if anyone wants to see a better-done example, he might check out "Bad Day at Black Rock." 
tt0363475; First showing sold out. Received a well deserved round of applause & standing O--lead by an elementary school kid. Incredible movie. Awesome hero. Great boxing scenes, gorgeous cinematography , funny jokes. Realistic & entertaining. (How often do you get that?) Good soundtrack. So surprised did not see a wider release or shown at bigger festivals. (Keep hope alive.) Anyone who thinks this is a niche film did not watch it. It is a people movie. It should have at least followed Smoke Signals' steps. I am sure it will have a cult following once on DVD. Everyone who is a part of this movie should be so proud of what they have achieved. Cannot be articulated. 
tt0363475;  I just saw Black Cloud today at the Phoenix Film Festival at it's world premiere.  This was by far the best film at the festival.  I absolutely loved it and enjoyed every minute of it. It is truly an inspirational film for the entire family.A film that was truly about people, about real people.  The almost entire Native American cast did an outstanding job on this film.  I wasn't expecting much from this film but came away with a lot.  If you have the chance to see this film definitely see it.  One of the best films I have seen so far this year, in this festival, but also outside of the festival as well.  LOVED IT !  
tt0363475;  I saw this movie last night at the Nashville Film Festival.  It was a surprisingly good movie.  Young Lakota actor, Eddie Spears, does an excellent job with the lead as "Black Cloud."   Russell Means, his boxing mentor "Bud", is wonderful.   This movie evokes obvious parallels to the original "Rocky" but has a lot more depth regarding the young man's personal demons and his place within his Native American heritage and the problems of the modern reservation.The movie is romantic, inspiring, funny and sad and delivers many truths about reservation life and the challenges of Indians who want to rise above the difficulties they face.  Rick Schroder's screenplay is very good.Steve Gainer's cinematography is stunning.  There are some wonderful scenes of horses and the outdoor beauty of the Navajo Reservation.Julia Jones, as Sammi, is convincing and a real cutie.Country singer Tim McGraw debuts in this film as the Sheriff.  He is good in the role.Some of McGraw's songs are in the movie and, one is delivered very humorously in a Karaoke scene.   The end credits roll behind Pat Green's "Wave on Wave."Schroder is a "bad guy" in this movie and did a convincing job.  He revealed he stepped into that role at the last minute because the original choice for the part was a rodeo cowboy with no experience who apparently "froze" when they were trying to shoot his parts.The acting is quite good even though many of the actors are young and unknown to most audiences.Rick Schroder was present at the screening I saw.  He and Eddie Spears, Julia Jones and Director of Photography Steve Gainer graciously answered questions from the audience following the screening.  They all showed considerable class and humility.  I was very glad to have been to see the movie and heard the principals discuss their roles more in depth.Schroder mentioned this movie was made for about a million dollars which is ridiculously low by Hollywood standards.  The high quality of the finished movie does not reflect its modest budget and Schroder says that is because it was a labor of love by the participants.  It is obvious he is right.I highly recommend this movie. 
tt0363475; The movie itself is great! A lot of great performances.. and great inspirational story line, proves if you work hard enough you can attain anything!.. also.. It's nice to see Native Americans playing other roles besides whaling warriors on the great plains.. not only is it stereotypical, but unrealistic.. Hollywood needs to realize that we as Native Americans have a bigger story to tell, we can surpass any crisis in life just as those who battle life's struggles.. I'm proud to put my comment on here not only as a avid movie lover, collector and critic, but as a Proud Member of the First Nations People! Stay Strong, Stay Proud!! Love Ya Eddie, Keep up The Great Work, you make us all proud!! /Robin M 
tt0363475;  This movie is definitely worth seeing. It is a very interesting mix of "Rocky" meets a "Western". A friend of mine saw the film in Montana last week and told me the crowd was blown away as well. I heard they made it for a million bucks. WOW. Tim McGraw is very good as the sheriff. Rick Schroder has ton's of talent as a writer and a big future directing. He was just nominated for a CMA award for best country music video. The girl is hot in the movie. I give it a big thumbs up. Peter Greene is the best I have ever seen him. He was the guy in the mask. Wayne Knight plays a creepy part as a pervert and is totally believable. The cinematography is incredible and the boxing scenes the most realistic I have ever seen.  
tt0363475; I would have liked to see what they could have done with more money and budget! Rick Shroder did a great job, and all the actors are to be applauded as well.I was afraid this movie might be too "dark" or "violent". Instead, I found it thought provoking.What I found most thought provoking was that Black Cloud finds out in the movie he has white blood in him. He feels this is a demon part of him, it is seen as impure. A good part of the movie is spent with him fighting his own internal demons. We all have demons - Shroder's ability to capture this for us, show us the struggle, and then the eventual acceptance and the strength that ones gains when you come to accept yourself is thought provoking in itself. To be able to do so in a story that is about love, friendship, and becoming a man - makes this story entertaining for all.Please take your kids to see this movie. It is a great movie for teenagers and all audiences. 
tt0363475;  I saw Black Cloud in Phoenix and liked it very much. Although some people have said the movie contains "stereotypes," I have worked with Indian people over the years and many of them have seen this movie and like it for its fair representation of Indian people in transition from one way of life to another. I heard Russell Means, one of the older Indian actors in the movie, say that he chose to do the script (apparently for not very much money!) because he felt it was an honest depiction of Indian people and the challenges they face. If Indian people are OK with it, I don't know why anybody else should have a problem. I especially liked seeing talented young Indian actors have a chance to show their stuff. I think both Eddie Spears and Julia Jones have great potential, and I hope to see more of them in future. I was impressed with the technical values of the movie--photography and editing, plus the music. For a first-time director, I think Rick Schroder did a terrific job.  
tt0363475;  I have just returned from seeing this film at the first annual Hatchfest, where Rick Shroder and the cast showed what an amazing piece of art they have created. The budget was minimal (only $750,000), the acting superb, and was made in only four weeks. This is the ultimate independent film. Eddie Spears makes his debut as a lead actor and embodies the very essence of his character. I enjoyed the entire cast and applaud Shroder for writing and making a film about REAL Indians. Too often Hollywood turns its back on incredible actors because of their skin color. I hope, for my own sake, that Eddie Spears does not fade into the catacombs of Native actors.I recommend this film to anyone and everyone and hope that you take two hours out of your life to see Black Cloud. It will open your eyes and give you a breath of fresh air.  
tt0363475;  I saw Black Cloud this past weekend at the Nashville Film Festival The story was very well told, I really enjoyed the cinematography and the editing, I thought both were very well done. The actors were all good including Tim Mcgraw as the sheriff. The Script was a bit dry in places and has a few cheesy lines but overall I thought the film was very well done. Rick did a fantastic job of directing his first film and I recommend if you enjoy boxing, it does have a bit of violence in the film. You go and see it. There are some very violent scenes so anyone who does not like that I don't recommend this film. My over all experience with the film was a good one, The movie depicted the real life of these Indian reservations camps and how they are sometimes treated.Very enjoyable 
tt0363475;  I saw this at the Phoenix Film Festival.  For a low budget of a million dollars, it was well done.The story line and dialogue are pretty typical, that being the "overcoming the odds to triumph in the end" movie.  A few clichA©s in dialogue like, "rules are meant to be broken" sprinkle throughout.  But the cinematography was good and the fight scenes were the most impressive aspect of the movie. When I looked up IMDB to see who choreographed the boxing, I wasn't surprised to see Jimmy Gambina, who did "Snake Eyes" and was a technical advisor for "Rocky," because of how well done the scenes were.  I was surprised, however, that he was on the crew for the film with such a low budget.Another impressive consideration is that they filmed this movie in something like fourteen days!For the first movie written and directed by Rick Schroder, it was very well done.  Also, this is a good movie for the whole family, minus the violent fight scenes. 
tt0046204; Although Rachel Donelson (Susan Hayward) is married when Andrew Jackson (Charlton Heston) meets her in a log cabin at Nashville in 1791, he knows that she will be his wife some day... And it is he who accompanies her when her mother, Mrs. Donelson (Fay Bainter), sends her to Natchez to get her away from Lewis Robards (Whitfield Connor), her husband, who is making her miserable...In a riverboat, on their way to Natchez, they are attacked by Creek Indians and the danger brings them close to each other... When they reach Natchez, Rachel stays at the home of a relative and Andrew tells her that they can get her marriage annulled and be wed... Before they can do anything, however, Andrew receives a letter from his law partner in Nashville, John Overton (John McIntire), saying that Robards has been granted a petition for divorce on the grounds of adultery, naming Jackson as correspondent...Andrew is humiliated by this injustice, but he feels proud of his love for Rachel and tells her so...They get married and go back to Nashville where Andrew becomes interested in politics... Soon, however, they find out from John Overton that although Robards had been granted a petition for divorce, it had not been consummated until now, therefore, Rachel and Andrew have been living together for two years without really being married... At Rachel's insistence, they are wed again at her mother's home...The news spreads, however, and at a party Charles Dickinson (Carl Betz) makes a remark about Andrew Â<U+0096> 'stealing another man's wife.'Andrew challenges him to a duel, and wounded, makes a solemn vow to Rachel that he will lift her so high that no one will ever again dare say a word against herÂ It is a pity that this well directed and well acted movie was not filmed in Technicolor as Susan Hayward looked so beautiful... One scene is particularly stunning... She's deliriously happy at the news that her husband is on his way home... Then she realizes that, having worked in the fields all day, she's messy and dirty... In desperation, she grabs a pitcher of water to wash her face and drops it on the floor... Her husband walks in as she is picking up the pieces and her expression, a mixture of wild elation and acute embarrassment, is truly incredible...Henry Levin's film got two nominations, one for Art and Set Direction and the other for Costume Design... 
tt0046204; Charlton Heston and Susan Hayward are Andrew and Rachel Jackson in this wonderful biographical film.Out on the frontier, Andrew falls for Rachel the first time they meet under difficult circumstances.The plot, of course, is where the two married but soon learn that Rachel's first husband, Lewis Robards, never got the divorce and therefore the two are living in sin. For this period of time, this is a national disgrace.The two are dogged by accusations of immoral doings during their lifetime.As we know through history, Jackson lost the 1824 election by chicanery and was elected in a landslide 4 years later. His beloved, Rachel, lived to see him elected but the years of scandal, adversely affected her health and she dies before his 1829 inauguration.Heston and Hayward were perfect as near examples of the American spirit during the very early years of our republic. 
tt0046204; Based on a novel by Irving Stone (who also wrote LUST FOR LIFE about Vincent Van Gogh), this is the story of one of the most vicious rumor campaigns in American political history. It is the story of how the love of the life of our seventh President was destroyed by these rumors, which were based on half-truths.Rachel Jackson, before she married Andy Jackson, was Rachel Robarts - the wife of Lewis Robarts. Mr. Robarts was not a good husband, and he and Rachel got a divorce. She turned to Andrew, whom she had fallen in love with. They got married. Then, a few years after their marriage, Robarts contacted them to inform them that there was some legal error about the divorce. He got a second one from Rachel, and she and Andrew (after double checking it) married again. Now, under the circumstances, this divorce - marriage problem is not horrible to us today. But in the 19th Century it suggested that Rachel had not behaved properly. In fact, to political enemies it suggested she was a slut who lived in sin with Jackson. Fortunately (or unfortunately) Jackson was the type of hot-tempered fellow who would not take this crap from anyone. He defended his beloved wife's honor throughout his life. If one thinks of the Presidents of the U.S. and their wives, Andrew and Rachel rank on the top with Nancy and Ronald Reagan and Harry and Bess Truman and Calvin and Grace Coolidge - the real thing, not the artificial marriage that is a political partnership (Warren and Florence Harding or Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt). The film follows the Jacksons lives together from their meeting in the 1790s to her death in 1829. It follows Jackson's rise as a frontier lawyer and planter, then as a military leader and hero, then as a political figure (he would be the most important President between Jefferson and Lincoln). But his hot temper would be shown in protecting the honor of Rachel. Most notably when confronting Charles Dickinson, a leading duelist of the day, who (as played by Carl Betz) openly refers to Jackson as a wife stealer. Jackson (marvelously played by Charleton Heston) challenges him to a duel, which we only hear the result of (Dickinson was a better shot, so Jackson wore a loose coat - Dickinson critically wounded him, but Jackson shot and killed the duelist). It was all part of Jackson's rough and tumble life. We also see him caning a little man after an argument over politics (it was Governor John Sevier of Tennessee). Unseen in this film was a real knock down fight with two brothers in 1813 that had an odd follow up - one of the two brothers, a rough hombre like Jackson named Thomas Hart Benton, found himself (in 1821) Missouri's first senator. Soon he was sitting next to Tennessee's Senator, Jackson. Both were embarrassed at the situation, so they talked things over, and let bygones be bygones. It resulted in a very close political and personal friendship. The slurs against Rachel always rose when Jackson's political star was rising, and his foes sought ammunition. In 1824 Jackson was the loser in a peculiar Presidential election that ended in the House of Representatives. He had been in the lead, but his chief rival (John Quincy Adams) was elected President when the fourth candidate (Henry Clay - a regional rival of Jackson's) threw Adams his electoral votes. Adams made Clay his Secretary of State. Jackson's supporters screamed of a corrupt bargain (we really don't know if there was one). In 1828 Jackson was nominated to run against Adams again. Adam's supporters mentioned every bloody event in Jackson's career (his duel with Dickinson, the fight with the Bentons, his executing some mutineering soldiers in the War of 1812, his execution of two British agents - he called them spies - in Florida in 1818). Finally they brought up the marriage mess with Rachel and Lewish Robarts again. It did not help Adams, who was beaten in the 1828 election by an enlarged electorate that liked Jackson. But Rachel was stunned at the viciousness of the attacks. She lived to see Jackson triumph over Adams, but she died within two months. Jackson never forgave Adams, Clay, and the other Whigs for killing her.The performances in this film are uniformly good, as we watch Susan Hayward and Charleton Heston interrelate so well together. And we share Heston's bemused pain at the conclusion of the film, he having become the leader of his young nation, and looking at the miniature portrait of his dead wife while he mentally talks to her about how they have arrived. It is a first rate retelling of this true love tragedy. It would not be Heston's last performance as Jackson (in 1958 he'd play the General again in THE BUCCANEER with Yul Brynner as Jean Lafitte, at the battle of New Orleans). But that was a cameo role - this film show Heston's strengths as a performer as he and Hayward grow together as an aging, beleaguered married couple. 
tt0046204;  This is one of the best historical romances on film. It's the heartwarming story of Andrew Jackson, played by Charlton Heston, and centers on his love for Rachel, superbly acted here by the beautiful Susan Hayward.The start takes us from the early beginnings of their relationship when she was still married to another, but eventually she breaks ties and in time becomes Andrew's wife -- a courtship that takes us from the frontiers to the White House.Life for homesteaders wasn't easy in those times of opening up the west, battling native Indians and fighting wars, however, Andrew gradually progressed up the military ranks although it meant many separations from Rachel. Their position in society had an uneven start, having to deal with scandal surrounding the circumstances of their marriage, yet in time this was slowly overcome, and as the years passed Andrew became more involved in political life, ultimately becoming president.A very human story.
tt0046204; I keep waiting to see this again on TMC. I wish I had been around to see these movies when they were first released, on the big screen. How amazing it must have been. There are some good movies released today, but on the whole, they are more childish and less adult and certainly less well scripted than movies like this.I find it a heart-breaker, and I cry my head off at the end. Charlton Heston and Susan Hayward are magic together, and this movie is magic as well. It points back to a time when yes, there were huge flaws in Americans, racism, etc, but they were on the whole a prouder race, and had more to be proud of, if you ask me.Charlton Heston and Susan Hayward serve as markers of the definitive pioneer spirit of Americans at that time, and as such they deliver outstanding performances as flawed but real and strong people fueled by the idealism of an America in a time of self-discovery.I wish they could make movies like this, full of heart and devoid of PC. 
tt0046204; The figure of Andrew Jackson in American history is one that is constantly being reevaluated by historians. He was the champion of the common man in his day though the qualification should be made, the common white man. He was a slave owner, unapologetic in that regard, and American Indians have no cause to love him as he favored their complete removal to west of the Mississippi in his time.Yet at the same time he was the spearhead of a movement to grant the franchise to the common Caucasian man. He was the first president who came from west of the Appalachians having moved from South Carolina to Tennessee which served as his base his whole political career. Our first six presidents came from the landed gentry who were the original founding fathers. Jackson worked his way up from poverty and never forget his roots no matter how rich he became.Jackson was also the ideal of the frontier civilian soldier. Though with no military training so to speak, he distinguished himself in campaigns against the Indians and won an impressive victory at New Orleans beating some of the best of Wellington's Army from the Peninsular War in Europe. That victory is what sealed his reputation and eventually put him in the White House.Irving Stone's biographical novel on which The President's Lady is based concentrates not on Jackson the historical figure, but on the love affair between Andrew Jackson and Rachel Donelson Robards. Rachel is played by Susan Hayward and she's a frontier woman and was until the day she died. Their love gets off to a rocky start because Rachel is divorced from her first husband Lewis Robards and weds Andrew thinking the divorce is final. In fact it wasn't and technically she was guilty of bigamy. They had to marry again and Jackson always defended his wife's honor by any means necessary as the film shows.Charlton Heston came over from his home studio of Paramount to play Andrew Jackson in this 20th Century Fox production. He plays the tempestuous Jackson and it became one of the roles he was most identified with even after he was Moses in The Ten Commandments. In fact he played Jackson again in the DeMille supervised remake of The Buccaneer.What The President's Lady does lack is any development of secondary characters. This film is strictly a star's vehicle. But when you got a pair of stars like Susan Hayward and Charlton Heston maybe it doesn't matter. The film ends with the presidential campaign of 1828 and it was one of the nastiest in our history. The elite of the east knew it would lose power and fought with everything they could throw. Rachel's two divorces became campaign fodder. By the way the Jackson camp weren't exactly shrinking violets either in this race. Still it did get down and dirty when it came to her.The President's Lady holds up very well for today's audience and if Andrew Jackson is no political hero for good reasons to a lot of people, he was in fact a great romantic figure and more than a model husband. In fact it's really what The President's Lady is all about. 
tt0046204;  This movie is basically factual. It gives an excellent portrayal of two complex historical characters. Heston is excellent as a strong Andrew Jackson and Hayward gives strength with a touch of humanity to Rachel Donelson Robards Jackson. You can get a feel for the ruggedness of a young Tennessee with Jackson as a person who will ascend to historical significance. It is the style of movies that you do not see anymore.One reviewer questioned whether Rachel died before Jackson became President. Yes she died before he was sworn in as President. Many feel her health deteriorated rapidly as she faced the negative comments made about her during the election of 1828. She was ostracized because of her divorce from Robards. This mistreatment was cause for several hotheaded reactions from Andrew Jackson. This is hard for our current culture to understand since by all accounts it was likely an abusive marriage. I know there is much disagreement regarding colorization of older movies but I would really like a colorized version of this excellent historical biography. It is a classic of this style of film.  
tt0046204;  The first presidential movie I ever saw was "The President's Lady". The movie tells a romantic tale about how President Andrew Jackson (Charlton Heston) met his wife, Rachel, a divorcee (Susan Hayward).  I first saw it on television and I loved the romance and believed the story.  The movie was a compliment to President Jackson and his wife. I love all kinds of political movies and dread watching the TV movie on President Reagan.  Too bad the Regan movie wasn't made with the same 1950's sensitivity.  This is Charlton Heston's best romantic movie.  Mr. Heston and Ms. Hayward made a good team.  Too bad they never worked again.  
tt0046204;  If anyone were ever to compile a Susan Hayward DVD boxed set (and I really wish someone would), it would have to include 1953's "The President's Lady." Both Ms. Hayward  and Charlton Heston's performances,  as Rachel and Andrew Jackson,  were able to make me believe they were of that time and place. I am grateful to see it replayed on television every so often.  
tt0046204; I'm delighted to see so many favorable reviews for this excellent picture. Released the same year CinemaScope made its splashy debut, 'The President's Lady' is a mid-sized production in b&w of typically high 20th-Fox quality. It would have been interesting if John Ford had directed it (it's his kind of film), but as it is, it is a minor classic all by itself, and Henry Levin did a great job.The score by Alfred Newman deserves special mention. Not only is it moving and poignant in all the right moments, it is positive and robust and helps make the picture succeed on every level. It's a typical Newman score, which means music of extraordinary depth and quality.Leo Tover's camera-work adds to the luster of this fine film. I can only request that it appear on DVD, for we enthusiasts, if no one else. 
tt0062808; Without even trying to, I have somehow managed to see four of director Jess Franco's 140-plus films over the last few months. The man has been so very prolific is so many film genres that he is seemingly unavoidable for anyone whose tastes tend toward the "psychotronic." "The Girl From Rio" (1969) is one of his more coherent, impressively made, larger-budgeted, less sleazy efforts, at least compared to some other works in his gigantic oeuvre. In this one, formerly golden Bond girl Shirley Eaton plays a character widely referred to as Sumitra, although here she's usually called Sunanda (AND despite being based on Sax Rohmer's female villain Sumuru...don't ask). She and her all-woman army plan to conquer the world from their base city of Femina (near Rio), if American playboy on the run Jeff Sutton and crime boss Masius (the always-worth-watching George Sanders) don't get in the way. The film features excellent set and costume design, a chic and catchy theme song, unusual camera angles and a decidedly mod feel. Shirley is just fine in her villainess role, and viewers who enjoyed Maria Rohm's work in that same year's "Venus in Furs" (also by Franco) will just eat her right up here. The picture, for the most part, has its heart in the right place and is something of a gas. Sadly, it is also excessively padded with inevitable Carnivale footage, never goes far enough in terms of sex and perverseness, is grossly deficient when it comes to well-choreographed action scenes, and lacks the budget to make good on its admittedly smashing central conceit. The film's a mixed bag, to be sure, but a stylish and enjoyable one. I would never recommend ingesting psychedelics before watching it, but still, the picture almost demands to be seen that way... 
tt0062808; As I live in Rio de Janeiro I was curious to see this film. The other reason I picked up this film was that it was directed by Jess Franco (I had already seen "Vampyros Lesbos", "She killed in ecstasy" and "Sadomania"). These films are what I would call porn trash - they tell stories that offer us luscious images of female flesh, lesbianism, mild violence and really entertain us. "Vampyros Lesbos", in particular, is a psychedelic sound and visual trip, featuring the gorgeous Soledad Miranda, present also in "She killed in ecstasy". Jess Franco has a sophisticated visual style of his own.But "The Girl from Rio"(called also "The Seven Secrets of Sumuru) is absolutely amateurish. It tells no story at all. Its plot is a mixture of science-fiction, spy-thriller and soft porn trash. There is the detective, a mixture of James Bond and Flint (the main character?) always wearing flashy suits and carrying a suitcase containing 10 million dollars, there are the girls from Femina, a city located somewhere near Rio that intend to conquer the world and enslave the men, and there is a gang run by George Sanders. The 10 million dollars is what they are all fighting for. There are of course lots of girls.Many fights, so badly done that people fall before they are hit. Femina was filmed inside and around the Museu de Arte Moderna in Rio. The gang run by George Sanders is composed by 5 people! There's a scene in which they run after the hero(?) wearing fantasy masks and after a ridiculous fist fight, he knocks them out and runs away. Incredible! Not to mention the "apocalyptic final battle" among the hero, the female warriors of Femina and the Gang of Five."The Girl from Rio" belongs to the category "so bad that it's good". I had my fun all right! By todays standards this film can't even be considered porn and the violence is mild.If you see this film, do it the same way you would watch an Ed Wood movie and you'll have your fun. This film was made in such an easy-going way that if you let yourself flow with it, you will have a smile on your face when it ends. 
tt0062808; - Since I recently watched Mario Bava's Danger Diabolik, I had an urge to see some other, lesser known spy movies. This is Jess Franco's attempt at the genre and he almost pulls it off. If it weren't for some lapses in action (and logic) this one would have been very good. But far too often, nothing much of interest is going on. In a typical James Bond movie, there are many instances where the action stops to further the plot. In The Girl from Rio, these stops in the action do nothing to advance the story. They are just there.- Franco probably had one of the bigger "name" casts in The Girl from Rio that he ever worked with. Shirley Eaton, from Goldfinger, is the villainous Sumuru. George Sanders, who I always get a kick out of watching, is very funny as the equally villainous Sir Masius. The biggest problem with the casting is Richard Wyler as the films hero. He's not interesting enough to carry the part.- Having watched a few Franco movies over the past few years, The Girl from Rio is decidedly tame. While the movie has its moments, the usual Franco sleaze is not evident. Too bad - it might have made some of the non-action moments more tolerable. 
tt0062808; Jeff Sutton (Richard Wyler) arrives in Rio de Janeiro with a suitcase with 10 million dollars, and the powerful mobster Sir Masius (George Sanders) sends his henchman Carl (Herbert Fleischmann) with his gangsters to follow Jeff and get the money. Jeff has one affair with the manicure Leslye (Maria Rohm) and succeeds to escape from Sir Masius' mobsters. Meanwhile, Sumuru (Shirley Eaton), the leader of the women of the City of Femina that wants to defeat the men and take over the world, captures Jeff and brings him to Femina expecting to get the money. Sumuru has several prisoners locked in glass cages, including Ulla Rossini (Martha Reves), who knows Jeff Sutton. Jeff discloses to Ulla that his arrival is part of a plan to save her from Sumuru. Jeff Sutton becomes a pawn in the middle of the war between Masius and Sumuru. "Die Sieben MA¤nner der Sumuru" is another crazy exploitation with free nudity of beautiful women by Jess Franco, the true successor of Ed Wood regarding bad movies, including his muse Maria Rohm. The acting, plot, fight choreography and dialogs are ridiculous, mixing a senseless spy movie with a sort of low-budget sci-fi from the 50's. Most of the situations are laughable and ridiculous, but a criminal driving a "discreet" hearse is something that even Ed Wood had never imagined. It is sad only to see George Sanders, from "All about Eve", working in a film like that. For a "carioca" (native of Rio de Janeiro), it is hilarious to see our Modern Art Museum transformed in the Femina, or Sumuru a.k.a. Sumitra, called Samantha in the Brazilian version released by Continental Distributor in the Trash Collection. The good points are the footages of the carnival in Rio de Janeiro and the external takes of the Wonderful City in the late 60's. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): "A Garota do Rio" ("The Girl from Rio") 
tt0062808; Cunning and ruthless femme fatale Sumuru (deliciously played with lip-smacking wicked aplomb by Shirley Eaton) leads an all-female army who are planning to take over the world while operating out of Sumuru's base nearby Rio de Janeiro. Handsome American playboy Jeff Sutton (dashing Richard Wyler) reluctantly joins forces with shrewd crime kingpin Sid Masius (George Sanders in peak suave and sardonic form) in order to stop Sumuru. Director Jess Franco, working from a campy script by Harry Alan Towers, relates the entertainingly goofy story at a snappy pace, maintains an engaging tongue-in-cheek tone throughout, makes the most out of the exotic Rio locations, offers a few inspired bizarre touches (for example, a gang of chortling flunkies wearing freaky devil masks), delivers a funny sense of sharp sarcastic humor, and stages the reasonably exciting action set pieces with more competence than usual (the lively climax is especially rousing). Moreover, there's a nice sprinkling of tantalizing peek-a-boo nudity and a bevy of beautiful women to make things more sexy and merry: The luscious Maria Rohm provides a tasty eyeful as the sweet Lesyle, the comely Marta Reeves likewise impresses as fetching rich babe Ulla Rossini, and the foxy Elisa Montes is a kittenish delight as Sid's loopy, yet sultry main squeeze Irene. Daniel White's jazzy and energetic score hits the swinging syncopated spot (the groovy theme song is a total gas, too!). Manuel Merino's vibrant and stylish cinematography gives the picture a funky psychedelic look. Extremely enjoyable vintage 60's kitsch. 
tt0062808; The clever marketeer is he is, Jess Franco naturally also cashed in on the huge temporarily success of psychedelic spy movies like Mario Bava's ultimately sensational "Danger: Diabolik!". Franco is the ideal man to shoot a similar film, as he could freely insert as much sleaze, kitschy scenery and absurdly grotesque plot twists as he wanted to. And he partially understood this very well, as "The Girl from Rio" revolves on a man-hating organization, led by a funky dressed lesbo, that plots to turn all men into obedient slaves! Unfortunately (for them, at least), the diabolical plans conflict with the daily business of a feared crime syndicate boss, played by George Sanders. All the right ingredients are well-presented, yet this is a surprisingly weak and unsatisfying adventure movie. The plot is rich on imagination, but seemingly only on paper, as the action is quite tame. The film is also very colorful...but not too bright and especially shocking was the total lack of vicious sex. There's a bit of nudity, sure, but too few according to normal Franco standards. All the characters are sick in the head, so the least I expected (or hoped for) were more perverted undertones or frenzied themes. Franco obviously had a bigger budget as usual to work with, and I must say he spends that money well on more convincing set pieces and talented cast members. Particularly the veteran actor George Sanders ("Village of the Damned", "Psychomania") is one of the best players ever to appear in a Franco production. Too bad even he can't save "The Girl from Rio" from being a huge letdown. A legendary Euro-smut filmmaker like Jess Franco could and should have done more with this concept. Shame, shame, shame... 
tt0062808; The Girl From Rio AKA Future Women is precisely the sort of loopy nonsense that we cult movie fans find absolutely fascinating: it has an outlandish espionage plot, born of the feminist movement yet still managing to exploit women at every turn, it stars familiar performers Shirley Eaton (Goldfinger) and George Sanders (All About Eve) camping it up like there's no tomorrow, there's crazy kitsch 60s fashion a go-go, and director Jess Franco (R.I.P.) ensures that the film is imbued with a strangeness and technical ineptitude of the kind guaranteed to keep his loyal followers happy, despite the whole affair being far more light-hearted than many of his other movies.Eaton stars as lesbian megalomaniac Sunanda who is hell-bent on dominating the world with the help of her all-woman army of men-haters (which in itself should be more than enough to pique most trash movie fans' interest). Building a vast fortune by kidnapping the world's wealthiest people, the power-hungry women's libber has built her own city, Femina, from which she plans to launch her attack on mankind.Sunanda's latest target is playboy Jeff Sutton (Richard Wyler), who is rumoured to be carrying $10million cash with him in his briefcase, also interested in the money is Sunanda's rival, Rio crime boss Masius (Sanders). In reality there is no money, the briefcase being used as bait to reel in Sunanda, Jeff having been hired to locate missing heiress Ulla (Marta Reves) who he believes is being held captive in Femina.With this three-way of Sunanda, Masius and Sutton established, all Franco is left to do is pad out his movie to feature length with assorted nonsense, which includes gangsters in creepy masks, lots of Rio carnival padding (including a one-legged reveller busting moves in the street), some torture via Sunanda's craptastic microwave ray, Eaton wearing a lacy body stocking, hilarious dialogue ('Don't be nastyÂ<U+0097>daddy doesn't like it'), more leggy totty than you can shake a stick at, and several silly showdowns, Jeff narrowly escaping on most occasions thanks to his incredible martial arts skills (a karate chop here, a judo throw there) or his trusty pistol (for use only when his chopping hand is feeling sore). When he's not kicking bad guy butt, Jeff's weapon of choice is his irresistible charm, with which he lures womenÂ<U+0097>even dedicated man-hatersÂ<U+0097>into bed with ease (thus allowing Franco to easily meet his quota of female nudity).Ultimately, Femina is stormed by Jeff and Masius, who form an alliance to ensure continuing male superiority, their assault on the city resulting in a barrage of badly edited fake gunfire and an amateurish assault of unconvincing stock footage explosions. In a suitably silly final scene, Sunanda is shown to have survived the attack, despite having supposedly blown herself up with a self-destruct device inside her gold vault. 
tt0062808; Girl from Rio, The (1969)** (out of 4) Coming from the same era as his FuManchu pictures, this European spy-caper comes from Jess Franco and actually is fairly decent as long as you don't expect too much from it. In the film, which is basically a take-off on Mario Bava's DANGER: DIABOLIK, former Bond girl Shirley Eaton plays Sumitra, the leader of a female gang who plan on taking over the world by turning all the men into their slaves. The girl gang must try and fight a couple evil men (one played by George Sanders) who plan to try and stop them. There's no question that this isn't a very good film but at the same time it's actually better than you might expect it to be. The biggest problem is with the screenplay that really doesn't offer up anything overly original or entertaining as the film's pacing is always at a stop-go motion that ends up killing the film. We get a lot of funky visuals as there's no question this is one of those psychedelic pictures that I'm sure many potheads might enjoy. You've got a pretty good soundtrack, some decent cinematography and it's good to see some familiar names showing up. Sanders was certainly slumping at this point of his career but he manages to be mildly entertaining here. Eaton also manages to turn in a decent performance and it really does appear as she's into everything going on and having a good time playing pretty much a female James Bond. She's certainly chomping away at the dialogue and appears to be having a blast. I think those unfamiliar with the work of Jess Franco might find themselves enjoying this because they're not really sure what they would normally be seeing from the director. Franco worked a few films into this genre but I'm personally not a fan of any of them so in the end this is a decent effort but there's just not enough soul here for me. I prefer his 70s output, which featured more bizarre and poetic films. 
tt0062808; Back when this came out on DVD through Blue Underground, I used to purchase films on disc regularly, and I even acquired about a dozen of this notorious director's work in the said format (including a number of Harry Alan Towers productions such as this is and 2 Fu Manchu pictures Â<U+0096> created, like the Sumuru figure here, by Sax Rohmer). However, I gradually started to hold back and then stopped altogether (though I did place a couple of orders during the last few months, with Franco's LORNAÂ THE EXORCIST {1974] actually figuring among the titles!), so that most of what came my way thereafter Â<U+0096> THE GIRL FROM RIO included Â<U+0096> was via ulterior sources.The film - known by a variety of other inappropriate monikers such as FUTURE WOMEN, MOTHERS OF America (!}, THE SEVEN SECRETS OF SUMURU (the English translation of its official German title) and RIO 70 - is a sequel to the recently-viewed THE MILLION EYES OF SUMURU (1967), with Shirley Eaton reprising the lead role (though she is actually called Sunanda here!), being Franco, the erotic element is much more to the fore in this case, with some mild if gratuitous nudity (straight from its opening moments!) which, however, does not involve Eaton but rather heroine Maria Rohm (Towers' own wife!). Typically, we get an ageing would-be star for the hero (CHARGE OF THE LANCERS {1954}'s Richard Wyler!) and a veteran presence clearly there to pick up a paycheck (George Sanders, who is made to ogle girls more than half his age and read comic-books while his henchmen rough-up the heroine!). While it is clear that Franco made these sort of films as a director-for-hire, he still attempted to incorporate his trademark concerns and imbue them with his recognizable style Â<U+0096> at least on that front, this works to a certain extent: the colorful Rio locations are striking (we are also treated to a title song!) and, though carnival footage (which was also featured in the director's masterpiece VENUS IN FURS {1969}) is adopted as padding more than anything else, there is a chase scene in which the pursuers are rendered more sinister by donning masks, equally notable are the vaguely futuristic sets and kinky costumes.Wyler is ostensibly a criminal who had looted 10 million dollars, this attracts both mastermind Sanders and ruler of 'Femina' Eaton (amusingly, she has been 'collecting' similarly audacious malefactors, among whom is the infamous Great Train Robbery fugitive{!}, and torturing them via a beam-less laser gun, that would also turn up later in Franco's DEVIL'S ISLAND WOMEN {1972}!). Another form of cruelty has the men pinned down to the floor and left at the mercy of a succession of voluptuous and previously-repressed girls (which, again, the director seems to have liked and re-used in the similarly below-average BLUE RITA {1977]). Along the way, the hero is also involved with Rohm (who surprisingly proves duplicitous), Sanders' kooky secretary and, of course, Eaton herself (in this, she frequently forsakes her dark wig from the previous film to show off her naturally, and frankly more appealing, blonde hair!). The film then climaxes with a virtual retread of the original's, as Eaton's compound is raided (by Sanders' men in choppers) and, though they put up a valiant fight (somewhat better than before since both Sanders and his mistress succumb themselves), it still ends with an explosion and Eaton herself fleeingÂ but Sumuru would not be back for another adventure (at least from these hands)! 
tt0062808; Take the secret agent / James Bond craze of the sixties, mix in some concepts from Sax Rohmer's female Fu Manchu femme fatale and stir in some absurdest twisted revisionism by director Franco - you have the man-hating lesbian Sumuru, or "The 7 Secrets of..." - better known as "The Girl From Rio" in the USA, recalling "That Man From Rio," which has nothing to do with this. Yes, this does take place in Brazil, we must give it that. Sumuru, or Sumitra as she's also referred to, is like an evil version of "Modesty Blaise," played here by actress Eaton with that familiar coy smile which most of us first became acquainted with in "Goldfinger." There are numerous close-up shots of her staring off camera, slowly opening her mouth, probably while watching something unpleasant (however, she is doubled in her key lesbian scene). She controls an entire army of female warriors, colorfully costumed, and rules a city called Femina or something (just outside Rio de Janeiro?). These concepts, which previously appeared in "The Million Eyes of Sumuru," sound terrific, but, despite some intriguing set design & visuals, it follows the same campy atmosphere of, for example, the very dated "Some Girls Do," which came out around the same time and which also featured a female army. At first glance, the sight of all these armed females, usually lined up in a row, catches one's interest, but, after 15 minutes or so, you realize there's nothing else there beyond just setting up the visual.The plot follows what seems like a secret agent, a male, arriving in Brazil with 10 million dollars. He catches the attention of the local crime lord (Sanders, hamming it up as an elderly Bond-type villain), who sends dark-suited thugs in bowler hats to accost him. This sets everything up for a 3-way conflict between the agent, the crime lord and the mysterious Sumuru (the crime lord wants Sumuru's secrets). Sumuru also keeps various prisoners in glass cages - maybe that's one of the secrets. This sounds exciting but there are problems which go beyond just a slow pace, there are many shots which could have used a lot of tightening: one shot of an arriving airplane, for example, stays on the craft as it settles to a near stop, as if this had never been captured on film before. There's a similar approach to a typical sunset, as if there's something unusual about it. The fight scenes are very substandard, as if the filmmakers had to use the first takes. To add some production value, there's a scene of the real Rio carnival about midway through. I'm guessing there were various budget problems, especially evident in the climactic battle, where fake sound effects and smoke cover up a lot of bogus action, such as the lack of even real-looking guns - it calls to mind those times when kids use plastic guns and pretend bullets are being fired, falling over unconvincingly. There are touches of sadism, such as torturing a character to get answers, and female nudity, an early depiction of such after some restrictions were lifted. But, mostly, you'll be rolling your eyes.

tt0142964;  This powerful drama (beautifully filmed in Iceland) was much maligned by Danish critics, which seems quite unfair to me, as I was very moved by it. Nikolaj WaldauÂ´s performance is one of the best youÂ´ll ever see, and Mads Mikkelsen is great as always. Debuting helmer Simon Staho lets his actors give it their best, but loses his grip somewhat with a derivative drug-dealer subplot, although it doesnÂ´t detract from an otherwise excellent film. Nikolaj Coster Waldau co-wrote with the director and eventually married costar NukAcka. *** (of ****)
tt0142964;  I will warmly recommend people of all ages to see this extraordinary film. ItÂ´s about a friendship gone astray and how to deal with the demons of the past and within yourself. The film is shot on Iceland and has some fantastic scenery. A very beautiful and moving debut from director Simon Staho and indeed very compelling acting from Mads Mikkelsen and Nikolai Coster-Waldau in the main roles.  
tt0142964; Lots of secrets here, underlined by male friendship and love gone stale and destroyed by time, maturity and cruel biology. The film reminds me of Paul Schrader's world - where things get as bad as they possibly can before people find themselves and access their better nature. Ossy's back and is in Jimmy's face and what is worse his space - his home with his wife and kid. The warmed over remains of the friendship are played out to their inevitable conclusion - Ossy always desperately pushing, Jimmy trying to disengage. Iceland's bleak landscape contributes a lot to the atmosphere but the strength of this film is in the performances - all of them good but Coaster-Waldau and Mikkelsen particularly strong. Both Ossy and Jimmy have everything to lose, one his life and the other his family (which amounts to much the same thing). Incidentally will Jimmy be off the financial hook at the end? Ossy has paid but in this world is that enough? 
tt0142964;  I just saw this piece of I-don't-know-what on video. What a waste of time! A wall of boring clichA©s instead of depth or insight, it's plain immature in stead of thought provoking. Superficial nonsense and wannabe-arty, that's what this movie is. And it's dead boring, too. Don't waste your time on it, fellas. In one word it's just: pseudo! 
tt0068246; The film deals with the bandit Roy King (Lee Van Cleef) and his band (Gianni Garco, Simon Andreu, Jess Hahn) that are robbing trains and banks along Mexican border . King is deceived by his recent wife (Gina Lollobrigida) and a Mexican revolutionary (Daniel Martin) and offer to collaborate in an attempt to blow up an arsenal for a reward about one million dollars , but he will be double-crossed . The gang will confront the Mexican army commanded by a nasty Mexican general (Eduardo Fajardo) and his underling (Aldo Sambrell) and are besieged in a fort governed by a nutty revolutionary colonel (Sergio Fantoni).This is an average Western with humor and action . The film is plenty of gunplay , thrills , irony , shoot'em up , comedy with tongue-in-cheek and results to be quite entertaining . The movie gets comic remarks of the spoof Western genre originated on the late decade of the 60s by directors Burt Kennedy and Andrew McLagen and stretch out to Italian Western with the Trinity series (Terence Hill and Spencer). Lee Van Cleef as an outlaw chief is humorous though very old , Gina Lollobrigida is attractive and James Mason finds himself miscast . They are like a hawk , a dove and a vulture , all circling for the biggest haul in the West . Besides , there appears the usual secondaries , familiar faces as Gianni Garko (Sartana), Eduardo Fajardo (villain in hundred Westerns as Djanjo), Aldo Sambrell (secondary in Leone Westerns), Daniel Martin (For a fistful of dollars) , Ricardo Palacios, Barta Barry , Dan Van Husen and many others . The picture was shot in Almeria (Spain) where during the 60s and 70s were filmed innumerable Spaghetti Western . The motion picture was regularly directed by Eugenio Martin who made among others , terror films (Horror express) and more Spaghetti (The bounty Killer , Requiem for a gringo and Pancho Villa) . Rating : Mediocre but amusing . 
tt0068246; At the risk of being considered the Devil's advocate, I must admit to being puzzled by the extremely negative comments regarding this film that have preceded mine. First let's grant the obvious: James Mason is truly awful and his accent is wretched...so bad that at first I thought he'd been dubbed by another actor. Waldo de los Rios' easy listening score is bizarre at best, and the Led Zeppelin style song performed by Jade Warrior during an otherwise atmospheric scene is completely inappropriate and terrible regardless. However, it must be said that Bad Man's River is an extremely attractive film, and the widely available Master Movies DVD is one of the better budget line discs you'll run across. Cinematographer Alejandro Ulloa clearly spent a lot of time on his set ups, and some of the footage--especially the riverboat sequences--are superb. Additionally, the action sequences are plentiful and quite well lensed. Bad Man's River is certainly a minor spaghetti, but as long as you can see it in widescreen, you'll be pleasantly surprised and reasonably entertained. 
tt0068246; This eccentric Euro-Western has more in common with the revisionist, light-hearted approach of BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID (1969) than with any of the sadistic Italian fare shot around the same time and on the same locations. A great, eclectic cast (Lee Van Cleef, James Mason, Gina Lollobrigida, Sergio Fantoni, Jess Hahn, Simon Andreu, Eduardo Fajardo, Gianni Garko, Diana Lorys) finds itself somewhat stranded - and in the case of Mason, evidently embarrassed - in the face of the film's bizarre changes of mood, some of which work (there are a few enjoyably comical action sequences) and some of which don't (why the director chose to overdose on the "freeze-frame" stuff at the beginning is anyone's guess), in light of all this, the involvement of talented Hollywood veterans Philip Yordan, Irving Lerner and Bernard Gordon is even more baffling. All in all, however, BAD MAN'S RIVER emerges as a surprisingly pleasant, if ultimately forgettable, diversion. 
tt0068246;  Heaven knows how a talent like Philip Yordan came to such a sorry pass as writing this mess.  Heaven knows how badly James Mason must have needed money for him to take part.  Lee Van Cleef, one of my great movie heroes, made some really awful films here and there, but this one takes the cake. The pop-rock/barbershop-quartet score, completely inappropriate to the time and place, is the first clue that the viewer is in for a melange of malarkey.  Everyone is dubbed, of course--it's a spaghetti Western.  But at least Van Cleef and Mason dub themselves.  However, Mason, who despite being second-billed doesn't show up until 2/3 of the way through, makes the most embarrassing attempt at a southern American accent I can recall ever hearing.  Gina Lollobrigida exposes her talent in her special way, and the rest of the parts are played in the broadest fashion by a cast of overacting hambones.  The plot is virtually unintelligible, though it does involve a river for a moment or two (the good guys hope their engine-less riverboat can drift from Matamoros to Laredo before the bad guys catch up to them--despite the fact that Laredo is UPSTREAM from Matamoros.)  It's obvious that much of what goes on here is intended as comedy, except, one presumes, for scenes of people being shot and burned to death.  Let's just say that none of the stars ever made a worse movie and then just pretend this farago never happened. 
tt0068246; Bad Man's River is a spaghetti western movie which I chose based on Lee Van Cleef being on the cover -- I'm not a massive western fan but even I recognised Van Cleef as a fairly famous actor in the genre. Unfortunately this did not equate into a good movie. Van Cleef is, I assume, the character for the title song: "He's the baddest man in Bad Man's River, where virtue is a sin".Does this movie have a good plot? No. It involves a complicated process of blowing things up and stealing a bank cheque, but seems to revolve largely around Alicia -- played by Gina Lollobrigida -- who marries men and betrays them but for some reason they never think she'll do it again. I mean seriously, after the third time a woman has sold you down the river to death or worse you've pretty much only yourself to blame if it happens again -- and it does.However, if we ignore the shoddy plot we have to ask ourselves if we're left with a good action movie. We ask that question, and we receive a negative answer. I'm a keen believer in suspending disbelief in movies...you have to go with the flow and accept what the directors are trying to do. Yet there is a limit. This limit was not reached when the good buys never missed a shot and the bad guys aimed for the feet and never got a hit* -- even with a sub-machine gun -- but the limit was reached and passed and left eating dust when a protagonist would fire his gun twice and four men would fall over. And who knew that a cheap mattress would provide better cover from bullets than an inch of solid oak? It's impossible to suspend disbelief for this movie, the plot is appalling, and the acting stilted. I rate it: A bullet to the head.* Oh, one protagonist gets shot. At least, he falls against a wall clutching his arm or shoulder or chest or something. It doesn't slow him down though, in fact it doesn't even bleed. 
tt0068246;  I have seen this film in a double feature together with SABATA and it fell clearly short in comparison with the latter. The cast is good(Van Cleef, James Mason, Eduardo Fajardo and Gina Lollobrigida) and the "sets"(e.g. a riverboat) are somewhat original. But the score is mostly annoying and the story was unable to really involve me(Don't ask me intensely about the plot!). The Comedy is often fast paced and sometimes mildly funny.For people who like the country/pop/rock score, however, things might look certainly different.3 / 10.  
tt0068246;  Not really a spaghetti western, as well as Italy it was financed by Spain and France. It's meant to be a comedy western, MEANT to be, it has a handful of funny lines and a bizarre accent from James Mason. It's a complete mystery to me why he and Lee Van Cleef bothered to appear in this. Put simply, the film is boring - the characters are cardboard and the actors look like they'd be having more fun watching paint dry. The plot is clichA©d and contrived, and difficult to follow. The freeze-frames at the beginning are just plain stupid. Beautiful as Gina Lollobrigida is, she just can't carry the film alone. Eugenio Martin really hasn't got an excuse for rearing such a turkey here, as the following year, he [the director] went on to make the far superior horror classic "Horror Express".And now, the plot: Roy King (Van Cleef) and his bank-robbing gang get caught up in a plan by his ex-wife and her new husband (James Mason) to steal $1 million from the Mexican government. But the group are captured and sent to a rebel stronghold. Besieged and under fire from the Mexican army, the rebel general is forced to offer King and his gang freedom if they can pull the rebel side through. And I only know that basic outline 'cause it's given in a slightly more in depth form on the packaging...Like I say, "Bad Man's River" is unquestionably awful. It's simply not even worth seeing as a curiosity piece. I bought it in a 2 for ÂL10 sale and now consider that to have been a waste of money. Some people say that for the sake of top billing, Lee Van Cleef appeared in some real stinkers. This time, I'm inclined to agree. 
tt0068246; Lovable rogue Lee Van Cleef steals from banks and blows things up for a living. He and his gang are hired by James Mason to explode an Army munitions stockpile in Mexico, using a luxury riverboat as a base of operations, only to be pulled into a bigger scheme that digs them even deeper into the revolution.Like most of the Mexican Revolution spaghetti westerns (A Bullet For The General being one exception), this is an acquired taste. Production values are a little iffy and it does run out of steam a bit near the end. On the whole though, there's certainly a lot of action and adventure to make up for it's shortcomings.A Spanish-made, but American-produced minor addition to the genre, this benefits from the participation of Hollywood veterans Philip Yordan and Bernard Gordon, as well as Van Cleef, Mason, and a few familiar European favorites like Aldo Sambrell, Eduardo Fajardo, Gianni Garko, Diana Lorys, and the beautiful Gina Lollabrigida.An oddball soundtrack goes from really dated vocal-quartets, to early-seventies style hard rock, with a marching band in-between!Recommended mainly for Van Cleef fanatics. 
tt0068246; Lee Van Cleef is conned by Gina Lollobrigida TWICE...first into marrying her (she robs him), then into helping her come into a million dollars thanks to her involvement with Mexican revolutionary James Mason. The unlikely pairing of Van Cleef & Lollobrigida actually works well but Mason is miscast in his relatively small role. Director "Gene" Martin keeps the pace moving briskly. This is a spaghetti western with a real sense of humor. A fun comic western marred by some really insipid faux country rock ballads thrown into an otherwise fine incidental music score. Also featuring the great Jess Hahn as one of Van Cleef's cronies. 
tt0068246; Lee Van Cleef plays King, the leader of a gang who robs a bank but quickly loses the money to Alicia (Lollobrigida) who marries him and has him sent to a lunatic asylum. Much later, King gets the gang back together again to go after her. She has meanwhile married Montero (James Mason) and made a new plan to steal even more money. King and his companions meet her on a steamship, like the sound of 'million' and decide to postpone their revenge..."Bad Man's River" has got an excellent cast (Fajardo as a general, Sambrell as a bandit, Garko as a gunman are in supporting roles), and it surely has some great dialog worth quoting, such as Van Cleef/Lollobrigida on their first meeting: "What do you look for most on a man?" - "Honesty." - "Umm... second?", Van Cleef tries again. Or when Alicia reminds both men she's married to: "You should be friends, you've got a lot in common - me!" I think I watched this movie at least 5 times by now, on British TV, German DVD and Italian DVD. Unfortunately, on neither DVD release the picture format was correct, clearly cut on the right and left and the quality was rather grainy, so the perfect remaster is something I still wait for. I always thought of "Bad Man's River" as very entertaining despite its little flaws, and I'm rather surprised at the mostly negative other reviews here. It's neither a typical European western of the time in its tone nor as well directed as American comedies ('Cat Ballou', for example), maybe somewhat unluckily caught in the middle. 
tt0029611;  Hidden from me, anyhow - I'd never heard of it until browsing through my local library's video collection.  Imagine an Ealing comedy as directed by Frank Capra.  All of the acting is first-rate (and Vivien Leigh, pre-"Gone with the Wind", was about as beautiful as any woman could be), and the sets are unusually lavish for what must have been a medium-budget film in its time.  The characters are strong yet sufficiently complex to lift the story above the simplistic comic melodrama it might have been - I can't imagine many American films of the time (or of this time) that would allow the "villain" of the piece enough courage to face down and walk through a mob that has just publicly humiliated him and is ready to attack him.  The comedy is wonderfully handled, especially during the scene in which a pack of dogs runs rampant through the villain's stately home, and during the climactic courtroom scene.  (The film's funniest line makes sense only in the context of the film:  Ursula Jeans' anguished "Harold, he called me a woman!")  "Storm in a Teacup" is a genuine delight. 
tt0029611; Why isn't this excellent comedy better known? More to the point, why is it so consistently misinterpreted? Most commentators view it as an amusing piece of froth about the provost of a small Scottish town (Cecil Parker) ordering that a dog be put down because its owner cannot pay for its licence. There's Vivien Leigh as the provost's daughter and Rex Harrison on top form as the journalist who makes the silly story national news. It's all very funny and delightfully played by all concerned. But underlying this story (adapted from a German play by James Bridie) is a subtle satire of dictatorship as was then current in Germany and Italy. Parker's role is very clearly based on Hitler, a times quite unsettlingly so, and it is in the bold but successfully intermingling of whimsy with dictatorial manners that the film gains its particular power. Cute it may seem to be, but Victor Saville was a wise and quite a subversive soul, and you'll find few other films from this period that so ably blend the dark with the light. Take a look at it again and see what I mean! 
tt0029611; Vivien Leigh, Rex Harrison, Cecil Parker, and Sara Allgood star in "Storm in a Teacup." Parker plays Gow, an arrogant Scotsman running for public office. As he is being interviewed by reporter Frank Burdon(Harrison), he is approached by a local woman (Allgood) who is near hysterics about her dog being put down because she hasn't paid the license. While talking on one side of his mouth stating that he is for the people, Gow roundly throws her out. Affronted, Burdon turns the incident into something akin to what Watergate was in the '70s. Leigh plays his daughter, who just happens to have fallen in love with Burdon.Excellent acting sparks this fast-moving comedy - in a run of the mill ingA©nue role, the beautiful Leigh sparkles, and a very young Harrison does a marvelous job as a determined reporter. Parker plays a pompous man with guts beautifully, and Allgood in her usual role as a low-class woman, is great. Kudos to Patsy the dog, who is the storm in the teacup.Really worth seeing for the very young Leigh and Harrison. 
tt0029611; I agree with the previous reviewer that this British film is an attempt by them to produce a Frank Capra like populist comedy. Certainly Cecil Parker as the town provost could easily have fit into a Capra film, a Mr. Potter from Scotland. Rex Harrison could easily be James Stewart, standing up for good.Cecil Parker is the provost (Mayor?) of a small Scottish town called Baikie way in the rural north. Parker's an efficient manager who's come to the attention of party bigwigs who want to run him in a bi-election for an open seat in Parliament.Parker is also a fatuous, arrogant oaf with the public relations sense of an ostrich. While being interviewed by reporter Rex Harrison, Sara Allgood who's a poor widow who can't afford the money for a dog license has her dog taken by Parker's police to be put to death as a stray. As she's begging, he throws her into the street.Harrison who was going to do a puff piece as we would now call it, is outraged enough to write what occurred.Complicating things is the fact that Harrison's fallen big time for Parker's daughter, Vivien Leigh. This was an early film for both and the megastardom that was destined for both is apparent.Of course being the oaf he is with his ego out of joint, Parker keeps escalating this storm in a teacup until it's a nationwide issue. But the ending couldn't have been better done by Frank Capra himself.Lots of laughs in this one and check out the scene where the dogs invade Parker's house. Could have been done as a short subject in and of itself. 
tt0029611; Widowed Mrs. Hegarty (Sara Allgood), ice cream peddler residing in a fictive West Scottish coast village, Baikie, has as sole companion her dog Patsy, but after she neglects to pay an annual canine licensing fee, the Provost (Mayor) of Baikie, William Gow (Cecil Parker) commands that the animal be dispatched, thereby inciting the titular tempest, for which a young English journalist is largely responsible. He is Frank Burdon (Rex Harrison), recently arrived in Baikie to begin employment with its newspaper. "The Advertiser", and it is Frank's willfulness that brings trouble upon himself as well as for others. In spite of romantic mutual attraction between Frank and Gow's daughter Victoria (Vivien Leigh), the dauntless reporter is well pleased to find a strong human interest slant within Mrs. Hegarty's plight and composes a story that immediately is spread throughout Scotland, therewith effectively putting an end to Gow's political ambitions, as he was preparing to stand for a parliamentary post, an aspiration that has apparently gone a-glimmering due to the Patsy affair, with the Provost moved to exact redress from Burdon by suing him for slander, an action that summons the probability of a final break between Frank and Vickie Gow. The film is constructed upon a play, "Storm Over Patsy", written in 1930 by German expatriate to the United States Bruno Frank, who settled in Hollywood as a screenwriter. It was rephrased for its exhibition upon the American stage by Glaswegian James Bridie and mounted with a good deal of success during 1936 and 1937 upon Broadway, the production generally featuring vocative Allgood in addition to Leo G. Carroll as Willie Gow. The provincial complexion of Baikie is more clearly rendered upon the screen than the boards, and fortunately Alexander Korda supplies adequate funding to furnish what he intends as a "small" film with significant numbers of extras along with a gaily embellished mise-en-scA¨ne. A contemporaneous review of the picture by producer/director/critic Basil Wright, published in The Spectator, expanded the amiable film's popularity, and it has retained a following because of its colourful scenes and characters, but a viewer will make note as well of superb costuming and, as must be expected, a superior performance by Parker who handily annexes the acting laurels here. 
tt0029611;  Rex Harrison portrays a newly arrived British journalist in Scotland who uses his new job at a newspaper to take on the local political bigwig in this pleasing British comedy. The unfortunate circumstance is that while he battles the politician, he happens to be falling in love with the politician's beautiful daughter, Vivian Leigh.  The issue at hand is the life of a dog that Leigh's father has coldly ordered to be put to sleep. It seems that its owner could not afford a dog license.  Dog lovers should enjoy one scene in particular where what seems to be hundreds of dogs of all shapes and sizes raid the politician's mansion. 
tt0029611; I watched this little gem this morning on TCM. What a delight! I'm a sucker for a dog story, and this little comedy captivated me from the first instant. It was refreshing to watch Vivian Leigh and Rex Harrison together in this early film, full of innocence and warm-hearted charm. Cecil Parker was the man you love to hate as the Provost. Although the ending is perhaps too good to be true, the bullying and the egotism, oblivious to the feelings of his constituents, is a very insightful portrayal of how the hunger for power corrupts, even when money is not the temptation. Add money to the mix, and it's a wonder we all aren't stuck in Nazi Germany by now. The romance between the two principles is very charming, with plenty of chemistry. For this film, the old saw comes readily to mind: "They don't make 'em like dat anymore!" 
tt0029611; Another connection to Hitler is that he was Austrian and went to Germany to make it an "Aryan" stronghold, and Gow is clearly English and wants to get elected on a Scotland for the Scots platform. (His meeting with the other mucky mucks, in matching Highland garb with incredibly frilly shirts, and the massive mural behind him on his broadcast, shows what a piece of theater the whole thing is. His cohorts are so anglicized he has to remind them to say Scottish not Scotch.) Harrison's character goes right to the heart of it asking if this were "Berlin or Moscow." And making a speech that the British will put up with anything but bullying or cruelty. Considering the fact that there was an anti-cruelty society for animals before there was one for children there, centering the movie around the welfare of a dog had particular resonance.There are a lot of funny bits--such as a mansion full of dogs of all sorts and a reference to the BBC as encouraging wildness in society, and much British character--such as the treating of Irish servants as less than human by the upper class of that time, and the use of song to make a mocking protest and laughter to bring down the mighty.I believe in Britain, even back then, as here it is that a woman cannot be FORCED to give evidence against her husband not that she cannot if she wants to testify against him, such as in a divorce case or if he were a criminal and she wanted to see him put away.Gow reminds me strongly of David Horton in the Vicar of Dibley. Both were forced to change although one has to wonder to what extent. 
tt0029611; When a young reporter, Frank Burdon (Rex Harrison), is given an assignment to interview a rather nasty and self-important local politician, it turns out to be very unpleasant. Although Provost Gow (Cecil Parker)* wants to run for parliament, he does a horrible job of impressing the reporter. This is because during the interview, Gow and Burden are interrupted by a local woman (Sara Allgood) who is begging the Provost to help her. Instead of helping, Provost Gow is completely unsympathetic and cruel--and vows to have the old lady's dog put to sleep!! Burdon is horrified and angry--how dare this local political boss mistreat his constituents like this! So he does what any honest reporter would do--he publishes the truth! This is a serious problem, though, as the paper was backing the Provost AND the Provost wasn't about to back down. Another problem is that Burdon soon falls in love with the Provost's daughter (Vivian Leigh)--and this relationship is surely doomed! This is a delightful film--sort of like a droll and British version of a screwball comedy. The dialog is GREAT and Harrison is at his best. It also helped that Cecil Parker was WONDERFUL as the buffoon politician. All in all, a great little film.*Speaking of Parker, he looked, sounded and acted almost exactly like David Horton (David Waldhorn). The likeness of the two characters is amazing. 
tt0029611; The provost (mayor?) of a small town in Scotland is an arrogant petty tyrant who is adamant that a poor woman's dog be put down because she can't afford the license fee. The woman, Mrs Heggaty, goes to the provost's house to beg for her dog's life. Even when Provost Gow's daughter offers to pay the fee and fines, he says no because it's a matter of principle and throws Mrs. Heggaty out of the house. A reporter who has newly arrived to the town ( and who also has fallen for the provost's daughter) observes this and later writes a scathing news article about this resulting in the town's people getting in an uproar. The article also gets national attention which puts a halt to the provost's higher political ambitions. The provost is livid and has the reporter arrested for slander. Memorable scenes include the provost, calmly and with great dignity walking a gauntlet of angry and derisive townspeople and the scene when seemingly hundreds of dogs run rampant through the provost's house. One of the funniest scenes occurs at the reporter's trial. An Irish maid, who is prone to using American slang, is testifying and at one point says to the prosecuting attorney "Sez you." The judge asks for an explanation of the term and the attorney give a lengthy, pedantic, and accurate definition of the term. The judge responds with an "Oh, yeah." Rex Harrison and Vivien Leigh were very good but it's Cecil Parker as the provost who gives the most notable performance (well, he did have the meatiest role). Sara Allgood also does a nice job as the distraught Mrs. Heggaty who so loves her dog, Patsy. This is a heart warming and delightful film. 
tt0078150;  An interesting and well-acted psychological drama about an unhappily married man (Perkins) who finds himself stalked by his first wife (Chaplin), a mentally unbalanced woman who spent the last 12 years in prison for murder. You've seen this kind of insane-female-admirer plot before, but here it's handled more intelligently and tastefully than usual.  It remains refreshingly unpredictable all the way through.Chaplin is particularly impressive, managing to exude fragility, menace, and just plain craziness all at once.  It's a solid performance if you're willing to overlook her ever-changing accent (is her character supposed to be American or English?).  The film also features an overbearing blues soundtrack that, while decent enough in itself, sounds like it belongs in another film.  Still, it's a good movie, probably worth viewing more than once. 
tt0078150; After carving out eccentric, obtuse molds for her personality while co-starring in Robert Altman's "Nashville" and Alan Rudolph's "Welcome to L.A.", Geraldine Chaplin finally earned a full-bodied (though still utterly eccentric) leading role in Rudolph's "Remember My Name", which was produced by Robert Altman. Chaplin plays an ex-convict and sociopath seeking a reunion with her former husband, a carpenter who has remarried and resides on the west coast, lacking interpersonal skills of any kind, she decides to get his attention by stalking he and his wife and breaking into their house. Intriguing, if unpleasant, modern-day melodrama with noir-ish overtures, made memorable by Chaplin's high-wire performance. Tough and unyielding, and possibly schizophrenic, Chaplin creates a portrait of a woman obsessed by the past, and wilting under the untouchable persona she has created for herself. The narrative goes a little batty in the final stretch, leading to a perplexing conclusion, however, the film's detached tone is very deliberate and assured--it creates a monotone ambiance which is hard to shake off. Director Rudolph, who also wrote the screenplay, seems to feel this material very deeply. It's a twisted and melancholy valentine. **1/2 from **** 
tt0078150;  I saw this film last night at the George Eastman House. The announcer said that it would not be released for video because of the rights to the soundtrack. The singer died without releasing the rights. In any event, I found it fascinating. However, the conclusion seemed rushed and didn't clarify the motives of the protagonist Emily.Don't read further if you haven't seen it!!!---- All of a sudden Emily gets Neil to her place, sleeps with him, steals his credit card and then drives down the road that she drove in on at the beginning of the film. As languid as the rest of the film is, this happens so quickly you don't understand the meaning or purpose to Emily's actions. I felt like I wished I'd brought someone with me to the film so that we could discuss what the ending might have meant-  
tt0078150;  From the comments I've read here, I don't think the reviewers saw the version I did, and I can say that now since I've viewed a video of the film. The ending of the film in my version (and I suspect theirs) was nothing like what I saw on the screen and blew the entire integrity of a film that built its suspense and imagery bit by bit to lead up to a shocking conclusion. All of the things Emily asked for in her apartment are tools of her revenge on her ex-husband, but you'd never know it. It looks like she just beds him and leaves him. She does way more than that. SPOILER She chains him to the bed and abandons him. No one will know where he is or come to his rescue. He might find a way out, but it's not a sure thing. END SPOILERAnd tht git who didn't like the Alberta Hunter soundtrack--the words of the songs tell the story of the film beautifully--must be deaf. It's an amazingly beautiful soundtrack. 
tt0078150; A really great movie anchored by a spectacular Geraldine Chaplin performance. Writer/director Alan Rudolph creates a real sense of melancholia with this film. Chaplin is a recent parolee who stalks ex-husband Anthony Perkins & his new wife Berry Berenson. As bleak as things are, there are also moments of real humor laced throughout this oddity. Chaplin does NOT adjust well to her freedom. She's scary, funny and inappropriately confrontational. Perkins is fine as is Berenson and the supporting cast also includes Alfre Woodard and a very funny Jeff Goldblum (as Chaplin's doltish boss). But the film belongs to Chaplin. Her performance is one of the finest of the 1970s. Alberta Hunter contributes some excellent songs that move the story a long and the cinematography by Tak Fujimoto is stunning. 
tt0078150; I'm a big fan of Alan Rudolph's. There's something "real" about his movies. I haven't seen this movie in a long time (where do you find it?), but I loved it.There is one scene in which Tony Perkins and Geraldine Chaplin go into a bar. They decide to drink their way through the "menu," and hours later, they are pictured sitting at a table covered with empty glasses of all shapes and sizes, quite inebriated. For some reason, I have never forgotten that scene. (Perhaps because I thought it would be an interesting thing to try.) The movie also introduced me to the blues of Alberta Hunter, which I still love. 
tt0078150; This movie is about sweet revenge for a betrayal.Chaplin's character was once a trusting innocent and was used, now she gives him his fair due. Perkins and Chaplin and Gunn are all so right in their characters (though Chaplin's accent is "off," as it was again in "Nashville"), but they each gave real humanity to their characters. And the haunting music is for me the best part of the show. This film introduced me to Alberta Hunter, and in the years following this film I searched out five more albums by her. Bravo! And when shall we EVER get a DVD publication of the full film? Evidently Ms. Hunter died before signing a release for a commercial VHS (or DVD), so it's legal wrangling that prevents us from having our own copies of this powerful character study. 
tt0078150; (Some Spoilers) Showing up in town to start a new life Emily, Geraldine Chaplin, begins stalking the Curry's Neil & Barbara, Anthony Perkins & Berry Berenson,making in the end their lives miserable and causing the two to break up, with Emily being the other woman, in a weird and drunken relationship between her and Neil.It takes a while to figure out what exactly Emily has to do with the Curry's. In between her strange and violent antics were pounded over the head with TV and radio news reports of a massive 8.6 earthquake in the Hungarian capital city of Budapest that, by the time the movie is over, killed upwards of one million people.Getting a job at Mr. Nudd's, played by a very emaciated looking Jeff Goldblum, .99 cent bargain store as a cashier we finally get an idea of what Emily is all about with the knowledge that she was a cell-mate of Mr. Nudd's mother who was serving a life sentence from the murder of her husband, and Mr. Nudd's father. Mrs. Nudd promised Emily, also a convicted murderess, a job at her son's bargain store when she go out of prison.Emily uses the job to steal money from the cash register and keep tabs on the Curry's who occasionally shop in the store. The big surprise comes much later in the movie when we find out that Emily was at one time, before he met Barbara, married to Neil Curry and was driven to insanity and murder when she found that he was cheating on her. We get a good insight of a woman scorned in Emily's conduct towards her ex-husband Neil whom she does all she can to destroy his life and marriage as well as everyone who has anything to do with him.Going so far as to strike up a relationship with her super and the apartment security guard Pike, Moses Gunn, who at first wanted to have nothing to do with the crazy nut-case. Later Pike inexplicably fell under her spell and was as easy to handle and manipulate by Emily as a puppy being lead by a leash. It turns out that Emily has a maniacal plan, that she cooked up while in prison, to punish Neil for everything that he did to her. One thing she was planning was to get Neil alone, and drunk, in her apartment and have her "lover" who in this case turned to be the very hair-triggered and jealous Pike catch him there, and with the poor guy handcuffed to the bed, violently work him over. I think that's what happened at the end of the movie even though it was all left, being off camera, to the audiences imagination.A story of insanity and revenge with both Geraldine Chaplin and Anthony Perkins giving Academy Award caliber performances with the haunting music of the late Alberta Hunter on the soundtrack singing her very timely song, that's just right for the movie, "Remember my Name throughout the entire film "The Love I have for you". 
tt0078150;  Geraldine Chaplin was so believable. It made such an impact on me that I can still remember it. Especially wonderful for me was the background music and singing of Alberta Hunter. It was not a movie of violent revenge. It was sweet revenge. Sure, it would be called stalking today, but she was just checking out that ratty ex-husband.  
tt0078150; After serving twelve years in prison for murder, a young woman (Geraldine Chaplin) seeks out the man who was her husband (Anthony Perkins) at the time the murder was committed. Why would she do this? The background story to this film is almost better than what's actually in the movie, although the movie is not bad at all. The crucial point comes when Perkins' character tries to explain the situation to his present wife, played by interesting Berry Berenson, after she has already encountered the rather menacing part played by Chaplin, in a tense scene in which Chaplin enters their (Berenson's and Perkins') house while Berenson is cutting up Romaine lettuce for tonight's salad. After she (Chaplin's character) is arrested for breaking and entering, Perkins's character decides not to press charges and then must explain why to Berenson's character. It's at this point in this movie that you can begin to figure out Chaplin's character's motivations, which lie nearly concealed. In this murky light Chaplin's character isn't as crazy as it is made out to be in the script, although twelve years of prison have taught her a lot about how to go about the judicious use of aggression, guilt, and other persuasive characteristics. The ending comes up rather fast, though endings like this one cause reflection, and that reflection may lead to the conclusion that in actuality there was nothing left for her to accomplish. She drives off on the same road she entered when the film begins. 
tt1239267; I had to see absolute winner of Pula Film Festival (best director,actor,music...) so I had high expectations about this one and I must say that I'm not disappointed at all. Since I also saw play "Niciji sin" from Vinko BreÂ<U+009A>an in theater in Rijeka, I was familiar with the script. In short description, this movie is about Ivan, ex-singer and war veteran who lost both legs in war. Ivan also has to face with his broken marriage and son that he doesn't see. Ivan has no future, just like lot of his colleagues from war (who either kill themselves or end up in institution). His father, Izidor is political candidate and he wants to win on elections desperately. His campaign is disturbed when Serbian refugee Simo comes to his house and starts to blackmail him. Soon, all secrets will come out.This movie is very interesting to people from this areas, who are familiar to events that happened in Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia during the war and after it. Foreigners who are not familiar with situation here in the war can easily learn something about it because the whole point of the story is about ex-soldiers who have obvious problems from war, and no one can help them. They are left to die alone and misunderstood (same story with American soldiers in Iraq - greatly told in "In the Valley of Elah"). Also I have to say that Ostojic movie is better then Bresan play because it's deeper in characterization (ironical parts are strong in both play and movie). Events are told retrospectively and the whole movie is carried by Alen Liveric in the main role. Liveric is brilliant and this is definitely the best acted role in Croatian movie for 2008. Liveric has support from legendary Mustafa Nadarevic and actors like Biserka Ipsa, Zdenko Jelcic, Goran Grgic and others. Everyone is great in their roles and I think this is the best Croatian movie in 2008. "Niciji sin" is Croatia's 2009 Academy Awards official submission to Foreign-Language Film category and it fully deserved that because it's a story about a family that is condemned to doom cause of stupid war. Recommended, especially for audience who likes festival types of movies rather then blockbusters with no brains. 
tt0189764;  The last of the three Rebirth of Mothra series is a really fine entry. Hopefully, the producers of this series will bring back more adventures of our flying Moth that saves the planet. In this film, the science behind can be a little to complicated for non-physics professors. King Ghidora kidnaps children and places them in a large egg-like prison. The three fairies "Moll, Lora and Belvera" return. Mothra is badly defeated by King Ghidora but there is one hope, to send Mothra back in time 130 million years to battle King Ghidora when he was younger and weaker. Mothra realizes that he cannot return and will die in the past. Moll sends him back but the power needed to do it kills Moll. Lora and Belvera are both trapped in the egg-like prison. The Moth finally is able to defeat King Ghidora in the past but mistakenly cuts off a piece of tail that will grow into another King Ghidora in the future. Mothra dies in the past but two dinosaur Mothra's put him in a time capsule of silk web. Both creatures make a new appearance in the future. This time the Moth has become an armor plated Moth. Can King Ghidora battle a tank plated Moth? Will the fairies remain two or return to three? Why would a creature want children? Excellent fight scenes and action. A must see battle of Moth vs Three-headed creature! 
tt0189764; Before I get into the actual film, a word for region one audiences (Canadian and American). You can't buy this film on DVD or VHS (you can buy RoM and RoM II as a double feature DVD). This hasn't been released on DVD yet, but in the future at some point there will probably be a DVD/Blu-Ray release. BUT BEFORE YOU GIVE UP, you can watch it for free (and totally legally) on Sony's website crackle.com. You can actually watch the entire RoM series if you want to see them before you whip out the cash to buy them on DVD.After being totally disappointed with Rebirth of Mothra II, I didn't have particularly high expectations for RoM III, but it was definitely better than I thought it would be. To start off with a complaint, it's with Grand King Ghidorah. He looks great, but his appearance is just bizarre. A giant monster randomly comes to Earth and takes children hostage? It makes no sense, even as a children's movie. My other complaint is that the monsters almost always look great, but the dinosaurs look quite cheesy.This one has almost no pacing issues, which is a great improvement over the last two films. But the plot of having two or three child leads with the screaming hero fairies and laughing evil fairy falls too closely in line with the films before it, and it ends up being a little repetitive. Maybe it's just me, but the film didn't try to branch out. I'm still not sold on the time travel aspect of the film, because although it doesn't create the billions of questions and controversies like Toho did the last time (Godzilla vs King Ghidorah, 1991), that's probably got more to do with the RoM series having a lot less baggage to it (if that makes sense).Its monsters also look the best, and we get the Armor Mothra, the most powerful Mothra we've ever seen (even today). For kids you could stretch its 5/10 score out a bit, but that's about it. Too many unanswered questions and random-ness going on to warrant much better. Such a shame given the quality of the actual monsters here.I would be pleased if Toho would bring Mothra films back again someday, but I'd lose the overly child themes. They seem to allow the film makers to dumb down the movies as if they think kids will care less about plot holes or acting. It's true, but it softens the experience for us older folks. 
tt0189764;  I think that this movie is a lot better than the two previous ones. King Ghidora looks perfect, probably the best I've ever seen him. Mothra is of course, my favorite. She looks really cool too, especially in her armored form. There is more city destruction in this movie which is good also. I like the theme to the movie "If your arms can't reach the mind can." The acting in the movie is splendid. The only thing that I think could be improved, is how everything happens. Like, when Mothra throws King Ghidora in the volcano and then he later comes back. Another good thing, is that in this movie they bring out more about Moll, Lora, and Belvera. I really hope they make more movies with Mothra as the star, because she has a great potential to be extremely popular.  
tt0189764; This is the third and last Mothra (Mosura) movie of the 1990s, and is, what I think, the best of them all-far more superior then its prequels. Here, we see the Elias fairies-Moll, Lora, and Belvera-given a more important purpose in the movie. They combine their powers of wisdom, love, and courage to battle King Ghidorah!The storyline is incredibly superb, combining suspense, excitement, sacrifice, and hope, making the plot of the movie staying intact and keeping the suspense built up, making you eager to know what comes next. Toshiyuki Watanabe's music score is beautiful, haunting, and refreshing. The songs sung by Moll and Lora are soothing and elegant. The special effects are great, and we get to see some city destruction, unlike in the two previousMothra entries. We have no annoying kids, overdone effects, and a childish story in this film. Instead, we have imaginable effects, heroic characters, an intriguing story, and a breathtaking rescue mission.King Ghidorah looks terrific as usual, and Mothra has two new forms in this movie, making it endlessly powerful. Although the male lead in this story is a kid, he did a good job in his role, and is not annoying as the kids in Mothra 2. His courageous act to go inside King Ghidorah's tomb to rescue the kids inside is breathtaking, as is the sword-wielding scene between Lora and Belvera. Moll says a very touching message to the male lead: "When arms can't reach, mind can," which reminds us that there is hope everywhere, and when it seems that the heroes were being overcome by sorrow, tragedy, and terror, hope is always there. This film also has several settings, unlike Mothra 2, which most of the scenes were set in this underwater fortress, where all the endless running and screaming rendered the movie totally boring and unremarkable. Mothra 3 gives you many scene settings, including a forest, a labyrinth, Kind Ghidorah's dome, Infant Island, the city, and the past where dinosaurs lived. We get to see a whole batch of dinosaurs in this movie. The "going back in time" scene is just another intriguing plot element in the film that adds on to all the excitement and suspense.Overall, a fantastic movie that is among my very favorite sci-fi movies from Toho. Great directing by Okihiro Yoneda and a great story by Masumi Suetani. This movie was so good that Toho should of produced more Mothra movies with the beautiful Elias fairies, using the elements from this movie that makes it great. Unfortunately, this would be the last Mothra movie, until Mothra reappears in the newest Godzilla series. But, a great movie to end Mothra's trilogy.Grade A 
tt0189764; I honestly find this one probably the best of the Mothra trilogy. As any kaiju fan knows, the Mothra trilogy had a rough start and is basically known for two things, annoying child-centered story lines and fantastic monster fights. The series has struggled to balance this out and with this one I think they hit the high point. The story still centers on a child character, but this one is older and for the most part this story has little to no child humor. Still, the human angle of it all is thinly written and not very emotionally strong, greatly weakening the impact of the finale of the trilogy. You would think the writers would bullsh*t and say Ghidorah seeks to absorb the youth of the children or something, but no, he simply gathers them up. This movie is nowhere near the level of something akin to "Godzilla vs. Destroyer" (19950 or "Gamera 3: Awakening of Irys" (1999), two kaiju masterpieces from around the same time period.What it lacks in character it makes up for in kaiju fun. King Ghidorah, also known as Grand King Ghidorah in this film, looks just stunning. As a fan of the dragon since his debut in "Ghidrah: The Three Headed Monster" in 1964, this is inarguably the greatest rendition of the beast. Never before and never again has the three-headed golden monster looked this terrifying and magnificent. Its younger form, Cretaceous King Ghidorah, also looks quite fearsome. Got to give the Toho effects team props on their work for the monsters in this one. The monster battles in this one are spectacularly done, with Mothra taking quite a beating till the finale of course. If you're a fan of Mothra or not, anyone can enjoy Ghidorah kicking the sh8t out of the giant feminine moth. There are a few short city-stomping scenes in this one, not enough for some fans taste, but this is made up for in the kaiju-brawls. All the monsters look bad-ass here, including the two new Mothra incarnations. Armor Mothra I suppose is Mothra's strongest from ever and after the battle is over appears Eternal Mothra and it's a beautiful design. See this movie, as with the others, for the monsters alone.That and Toshiyuki Watanabe's score is pretty awesome, capturing the feel of a sci-fi/fantasy film. There's also some fun cheese with the prehistoric battle 130 million years ago while Mothra and Cretaceous King Ghidorah fight. As they do, a T-Rex and a Triceratops actually stare at each other in bewilderment before continuing to watch the battle.Nowhere near the pinnacle of Japanese monster movies but a fun watch. 
tt0189764; Alright I really enjoyed this movie. There were many things that I enjoy in a good kaiju flick, that were seen in this movie. First off, Mothra is looking the best of her 90's forms, and King Ghidorah looks pretty good as well. Second, the plot isn't half bad...if you can get over the somewhat childish aspect of it. A few things that I didn't like were how the Alias & Belvira looked different than they did in the previous movies. Another thing that bothered me was the dinosaur graphics. Clearly they spent too much money on Mothra & Ghidorah to put good effort towards a T-rex. But these are only minor details, that I got over pretty fast. I suggest you find a good Japanese cut if you want to see the movie at it's finest, however the English Sci-fi TV version isn't half bad. 
tt0189764; This is one of the new REBIRTH OF MOTHRA trilogy films.  As I have not seen the other two movies (though I have seen the original 1961 film), I will not say that this is the best of the series, though it probably is.  Featuring the D**M COOLEST King Ghidorah design EVER and a look at a baby Ghido, this is cool film!  But the dinosaur effects are the worst ever.  I mean, they look like crappy-looking moving TOYS! NOTE: This movie is not released in the US. 
tt0189764; I had bit of a frustration about these '90s Mothra movies. That its special effects could be little more realistic etc. But now I think about it, these movies were kicking a** with bigger and brighter than life cinematography and plot when everything in our world was turning towards darkness (if you think about all the sci-fi, super hero movies that came out in the '90s and how dark they were). Here finally someone had a plot where motivation for destruction was not anger, but force of nature is trying to stop another force of nature from causing catastrophe.I just think these movies are great because it depicts another world that isn't like ours but brighter and people living in it is brighter too. Topics of Mothra series was more geared towards the world than say like Batman, where it was just about Bruce, his personal issues and few bad guys. Mothra series was talking about things like destruction of nature, and value of our children.When everything around us was getting darker, it's a real treat to throw these bigger and brighter than life movie up on the screen and just kick back for 90 minutes. 
tt0189764;  This movie is the third and last film of the Mothra trilogy. It concerns King Ghidorah invading earth and stealing children. Mothra comes to fight King Ghidorah and three battles ensue: one in the forest, one in the Cretaceous period, and one in the forest again. In the end, Mothra and the power of good prevail against King Ghidorah and the power of evil.Now there are quite a few improvements and good points about this film. King Ghidorah is an awesome monster, much more impressive than the 1991 version, Death Ghidorah, and Dagahra. Mothra is impressive too. The city destructions scenes are quite exciting and fun to watch. The monster battle scenes were able to recapture much of the intensity that the Godzilla movies had but the first two Mothras lacked. Though the film is still directed at children, the main character is a bit older and not as annoying as the kids from the previous entries were.Now, there are some aspects that really detracted from the film. The city destruction scenes, while exciting, are way too short. The previous two Mothra films had monster fights that nearly took up the entire middle portion of the film whereas this movie had one short one, one medium-sized one, and (following in tradition of the other two) a short final battle. The musical talents of Akira Ifukube are lacking as well. I also thought that the Prehistoric Mothra scene was quite contrived.Overall, it's a fun movie to watch but still doesn't live up to the level of Godzilla. However, it's still good to see King Ghidorah looking as magnificent as ever. 
tt0189764;  By far the best movie of the Mothra Triolgy. This movie has one thing that the other 2 didn't, a lot of city destruction. Oh and the new King Ghidorah looks so good. And all of the special effects of him flying through buildings is so well done, it has to make you wonder what is in store for us in Godzilla 2000. Also Mothra gets into a new form of course, which I think is the best of them all, that is here Metal Mothra form, it is just so cool how she slices and dices Ghidorah up. If I would have to make a complaint about this movie it would be that a kid is a main character (groan!), and that all of the dinosaurs look really bad in this movie. But still a great movie minus these things. 
tt1132607; 'Versailles,' which contains remarkable performances by the late Guillaume Depardieu, dead last year at only 37, and a seven-year-old boy named Max Baissette de Malglaive, is about homeless people, but it's also about identity and freedom, regeneration and loss. Recovering from a life of homelessness or from drug addiction, the film says, takes about six or seven years. And a life without borders or plans has its attraction and its myths. Schoeller's screenplay and direction make realism an adventure, delving into harsh truths without resorting to miserabilism or sociology. In the flickering light of a bonfire in the woods, its characters sometimes seem to have returned to a primordial age or moved forward to the future nether-world of Haneke's 'Time of the Wolf.' The resolutions may seem too fairy-tale, but intense, authentic performances and handsome cinematography make this somewhat thin tale redeem itself over time. It's sui generis style may eventually earn it a following. Depardieu and de Malglaive almost deserve comparison with Lamberto Maggiorani and Enzo Staiola of De Sica's 'Bicycle Thief.' Like Staiola, young de Malglaive seems well on is way to a film career, with a couple more film roles already under his belt. Depardieu has an edge and an innate marginality himself, an emotional transparency, that combine to give his Damien memorable authenticity and life.We seem to be plunged into lurid sociology in the murky grimness of the opening sequence, where Nina (Judith Chemla) struggles from day to day living on the streets of Paris with her child, Enzo (de Malglaive). One evening she is forcibly rescued by social services that take her and the boy to a shelter at Versailles, of all places, near the palace of Louis XIV, the "Sun King." Instead of making it back to Paris the next day she wanders into a wood and they encounter Damien (Depardieu), living in a rough "hut" (cabane) he may have thrown together himself. He's ravaged looking, but lean, young, strong, and resourceful. He seems to always have cigarettes, and mostly food of some kind, and a wood fire to stay warm and cook by. Damien has little use for either Enzo or Nina, but he lets them stay a few nights, and one evening after Enzo's asleep, he and Nina find each other. Then she disappears leaving a note, and Damien's stuck with Enzo.This gesture may seem a tragedy and a crime, but may also be Nina's only hope. She knows Damien can be trusted. She locates earth-mother-ish Mme Herchel (Brigitte Sy), the woman from her first night in Versailles, who had promised her work. Enzo is dirty and tired and sometimes hungry all the time, but he knows no other life. He gloms onto Damien, and Damien feeds, bathes, and protects him. There's a little group of squatters who've staked out territory in the wood, and their bonds are strong, as we see when one of them dies.Nina learns to care for old people under the protection of Mme Hershel. When she's made some progress she goes back to the wood. The hut is gone, burned down, not a trace left. Nina is devastated and seems to fall back into homelessness, there and then.When winter comes full on, Damien turns up at the house of his hostile father, Jean-Jacques (Patrick Deschamps), who now has a young wife, Nadine (Aure Atika). Damien's been given some money and offers it to pay for lodging, but there's no trust because he has been a drug addict. The argument ends anyway when Enzo waltzes right in to the house. Nadine takes to him. Damien gets a job in construction. Enzo adjusts poorly to bourgeois life and begs to go back to the hut, but Damien tells him that's over.The film is most obvious but still authentically French in its constant assertion of the "republic's" over-structured system of loyalties and duties which provides extensively for the misbegotten by US standards, but still is letting more and more people slip under its protective radar. Damien reluctantly follows Jean-Jacques' suggestion and acknowledges Enzo as his son so the boy will have legal status and can go to school. But once this "rebirth" is celebrated, Damien's commitment to work and stability seems to vanish.A brief epilogue shows Enzo seven years later, acclimated and schooled and living with Jean-Jacques and Nadine, but still remote and struggling when his mother turns up.This is the directorial debut of Pierre Schoeller, a screenwriter for fifteen years. The film, which debuted in the "Un Certain Regard" series at Cannes, opened in Paris August 19 to generally good but not great reviews. It has a kind of poignancy given French cinema's loss of the talented, doomed Guillaume Depardieu, and it's hard to watch him struggling to breathe in an outdoor winter sequence knowing that he died of pneumonia two months after the film's release. With this role (as well as Rivette's 'Duchess of Langeais' and Verheyde's 'Stella'just to name recent roles),' it's clear that with Guillaume's passing we lost greatness. Versailles was shown as part of the Rende-Vous with French Cinema at Lincoln Center, New York, in March 2009, as was Verheyde's 'Stella.' 
tt1132607; Although the film (or what I could made up of it) es nice, touching and well acted, French DVD lacks subtitles and it's a pity. I don't understand why they do this, preventing all of us to buy their products. So, if you want to understand the whole of it, you'll have to wait until the film is available in your not French speaking country. Hmmm! That's too bad!On the other hand, the story is compelling, realistic and has an extra interest: the cast is magnificent. They all are great actors, including the boy. We can also see one of the last performances Guilaume Depardieu made before his premature death (aged 37). Photograph, sometimes too dark, but effective, music nice, etc. Just the problem with the subtitles made me give the film so low a vote.

tt0048944; It is certainly not true that because a film has as its central character a female protagonist that it must be a "woman's picture". But in an era when the novel market in cheap-minded fiction seems hopelessly divided between mindless male violent thrillers and mindless female Gothic romanciful fantasies, the viewer must expect this debate to spill over into films. Fortunately for moviegoers, as late as the 1950s, films such as "The Ambassador's Daughter" were still being made and these were films with enough realistic characters, intelligent dialogue and interesting action to please adult viewers. This is a very fine script indeed by veteran writer-director Norman Krasna. It was directed very ably and beautifully mounted. The noteworthy cast included Edward Arnold, Myrna Loy, Adolph Menjou, Frances Lederer, Tommy Noonan plus Olivia de Havilland and John Forsythe as the romantic leads. The setting is postwar Paris, and the sets are beautiful to behold. This is a film about upper crust folk, and as such we are treated to costumes by Christian Dior, impeccable lighting and gorgeous art direction. But the fact that these are members of the wealthy set does not stop the scriptwriters from devising lively and challenging involvements for all. The very good idea for the story involves de Havvilland trying to prove to her ambassador father, professionally and personally worried about such matters, that all French-based American soldiers are not "wolves". She picks on Forsythe to prove her point--and discovers she may have picked too well for her own safety, since she finds herself falling for the shy G.I. Arnold and Loy are particularly good, Menjou is his usual charming self, and de Havilland is superb. Only Forsythe seems a bit low-voltage, as he sometimes did early in his career, before "The Trouble With Harry". The film's technical elements, such as lighting, sets, art direction and all else provide the usual first-rate MGM realization. The color is lovely as well, adding to the gemlike quality of this underrated and very intelligent comedy. In an era devoted to Medieval character flaws, misbehaviors and irresponsible folk floundering in a sea of surrealistic bad writing and worse thinking, this earlier work stands out as a cinematic delight, one to be watched many times over. 
tt0048944;  Olivia de Havilland spent most of her post-Oscar years in serious dramas, so it's nice to see her looking so radiantly lovely in a technicolor comedy, enjoying herself in a comedy for a change. Paris is the setting and the color photography is excellent. The slight story concerns de Havilland seeking to prove to her father (Edward Arnold) and a senator and his wife (Adolphe Menjou, Myrna Loy) that American servicemen aren't all wolves and to prove it has a harmless fling with a young G.I. (John Forsythe). Unfortunately, as in all Norman Krasna comedies, plot complications develop before she winds up in Forsythe's arms for an amusing final scene. The cast sparkles with some fine work by de Havilland, Myrna Loy, Adolphe Menjou, Edward Arnold and--in one of his funniest roles--Tom Noonan. Only bad piece of casting is John Forsythe--who looks wooden and uncomfortable throughout with no comic flair whatsoever. Despite this, de Havilland manages to give a spirited performance that won the Belgian Prix Femina for Best Actress in a comedy in '56.  Slight but amusing and very watchable. 
tt0048944; The only reason that Olivia de Havilland agreed to appear in this trifle must have been because it was going to be filmed in Paris where she was living at the time. On the positive side, there are great stars supporting de Havilland such as Edward Arnold, Adolphe Menjou and Myrna Loy, and they are very very good, as is the Star, but negatively speaking, the story has been done many times, but it could have been quite good, if a decent leading man had been engaged - there is no doubt John Forsythe was out of his depth, trying to compete with the players listed above. There were some bright moments of comedy, and it was good to see the Stars having a bit of a romp, but at times it is hard going. As lovely as she is, Olivia was too old for the part, but some of the shots of Paris helped a lot. 
tt0048944; THE AMBASSADOR'S DAUGHTER is a generally well made film with a great cast. The story and direction though are uninspired and workman-like and robs the story of any vitality. In more capable hands, this film would have been a charmer but the producers were clearly aiming for average. It just doesn't sparkle as it should be and because the pacing or tone, which should have been lightning fast and sharp for this kind of story, is lackadaisical, this big studio production feels and looks exactly like an episode of THREE'S COMPANY. One that takes place in Paris.The great thing about this movie is Myrna Loy. Whenever she's on screen the movie comes alive. Loy, who starred in the great THIN MAN movies, has a knack for delivering light and funny dialogue and her timing here is perfect. She easily eclipses the whole cast, which includes Olivia De Havilland, John Forsythe, Adolphe Menjou, Tommy Noonan! Thank god Myrna was in this film or else it would have been totally forgettable. Well, the location shooting was also great.All in all, I enjoyed watching THE AMBASSADOR'S DAUGHTER for what it was but it could have been much better, a classic in fact. Now it's just average. 
tt0048944; This was a very entertaining film from 1956 with some great veteran actors who have had great roles in their careers and this is a rather silly film which seems to go on and on. However, this is a comedy concerning an American Ambassador's Daughter named Joan Fisk, (Olivia De Havilland) who live in France and meets up with a soldier named Danny, (John Forsythe) and Joan is modeling various dresses for an American Red Cross Benefit and Danny becomes very attracted to Joan. Joan does not tell Danny she is the daughter of an American Ambassador and pretends to be a French girl who is a professional model. There are wonderful actors in this film, namely, Myrna Loy, (Mrs. Cartwright), Adolphe Menou, (Sen. Jonathan Cartwright) and Tommy Noonan, (Cpl. Al O'Connor all gave outstanding supporting roles. If you like old time comedy films, this is the film for you. 
tt0048944; What I learned about the fascinating Paris sewer system was easily the best part of this film. Unfortunately that scene lasts for about 2 minutes. The rest of the film just seemed flat, dull, limp.The production values of this film are the next best thing. It is, indeed, a Technicolor treat to the eyes. The women's costumes are lovely. The sets are also nice. However, the director is totally clue-less about the artistic use of a camera or a soundtrack. Much of this film lacks background music. This lack of comedy-mood-setting music is devastating because this story is not inherently funny, and the only member of the cast that has a sense of comedy (or really has any funny lines) is Tom Noonan. So whatever comedy is there, is undermined by the lack of an appropriate soundtrack. There are a couple of scenes when we hear some ambient, "street" music - the predictable Parisian accordion, and the completely unexpected Breton bagpipes droning in an over-packed Eiffel Tower elevator - preposterous and rude, but not funny! There is also music, of course at the ballet, where the scenes are photographed in a totally static, pedestrian, uncreative way. However, background piano or light string music is conspicuously absent in the charity fashion show scenes. And transitional scenes such as Forsythe's walking along a street toward the airline ticket office are music- less. Without music, such scenes contribute nothing to the erstwhile "comedy" atmosphere of the film. Instead, they are just flat plot devices. The entire film is similarly flawed, leaving it to the actors, themselves, to convey the comedy. Unfortunately none of these actors is up to the task.The plot is a lot like Clash of the Titans - a mythical melodrama! But instead of Greek gods testing the character of a "mortal," here we have a senator, a general and the U.S. ambassador to France testing the character of a U.S. serviceman in Paris. Except for Noonan, the cast plays this movie like a Greek tragedy. Noonan is a little more restrained than usual, although he still seems very hammy because his role is in such stark contrast to the rest of the cast. He seems like he is performing in a completely different movie.The repetitious wallet-losing has potential for comedy that is totally lost. The first instance sets off a heated accusation-and-denial confrontation between Forsythe and DeHavilland. After such heat, it is so suddenly and easily dismissed that it is very awkward. It is not simply a lost opportunity for comedy, but it's unreal. When the wallet is lost a second time, while DeHavilland and Forsythe are at a nightclub, the comedy is supposed to be conveyed by the two actors yukking it up with stage laughter. DeHavilland's predictable line, "I didn't steal it" is supposed to be the cause of such belly-laughing for them (and presumably for us). Sadly, the line would have been only moderately humorous had it been well delivered. The nightclub has another lost opportunity for comedy. Instead of ending in a funny encounter between Forsythe, the club host and the gendarmes, it is a mere plot device - everybody playing it straight - most polite, gracious and sincere!What one commentator mistakenly calls the final scene is actually the penultimate scene. It is admittedly one of the better scenes AND (coincidentally) one of the few with soundtrack music to help set the mood! (This scene WOULD have made for a nice ending, but the director is too heavy-handed for that. So in a totally superfluous scene tacked onto the end, we see Bride DeHavilland and Groom Forsythe, with the rest of the cast kneeling in a cathedral before a priest during what is obviously their wedding ceremony.)Olivia DeHavilland is, as several commentators have noted, hopelessly miscast. She is not only too old, but comic delivery is a part of her craft that totally eludes her.John Forsythe, likewise has no sense of comedy or comic timing. He plays his role almost exactly the same as Harry Hamlin portrayed Perseus in Clash of the Titans!Menjou, who I usually enjoy, delivers a very unfunny performance as the senator. The senator is (unbelievably!) a tightwad. His touching of DeHavilland's face at the ballet is not only unsporting, but also offensive. His character is very unsympathetic, if not downright despicable - and definitely NOT funny. And the lip service paid to penny-pinching is not ever comical.Myrna Loy... WHY? She is another one of my faves, but here she seems bereft of energy. She seems rather wistful or even sad when attempting to discuss the Prince with Menjou or offering "motherly" advice to DeHavilland. Then her scene with Forsythe at the ballet is definitely NOT funny. She tells Forsythe that she was in the presence of Menjou when he struck "a woman" (HA-HA! Now THAT'S hilarious! I wonder who she meant? Wink, wink, nudge, nudge! )The general is a mere functionary, and Edward Arnold almost a non-entity.Finally, there is DeHavilland's fiancA©, the Prince. What was he doing in this film? He has about 3 "straight" lines, and the rest of the time he strains to sit around looking "princely." He provides no conflict with Forsythe or resistance to DeHavilland's leaving him. He is a totally superfluous "prop!"I never felt any chemistry among ANY of the cast members. Consequently, I was pretty indifferent to their respective fates. They all seemed to be actors delivering lines and receiving a paycheck at the end of the day. I suspect each one of them regards this film as a personal embarrassment. The plot is weak, the lines weaker. The cinematography is totally unimaginative, wasting some nice sets. The direction is clue-less. The acting is uninspired, failing to strike the right tone. And the lack of a good soundtrack is the nail in the coffin of this cadaver. Lifeless. 
tt0048944; Frothy bit of fluff but with a great deal of charm. The entire cast are expert comedians excepting Forsythe but his role is really that of the straight man anyway. This was Myrna Loy's first supporting role after years in the star spot but while she is clearly secondary her skillful presence keeps her in mind even when she is off-screen. Tommy Noonan is most amusing as Forsythe's befuddled pal, his gauche hayseed with a good heart makes a nice counterpoint to the sophistication of the other players. Shot entirely in Paris with clothes by Dior this is a chic soufflA© of the type that Hollywood has no idea how to make anymore. 
tt0048944; Two elements noticeably kept "The Ambassador's Daughter" from becoming a classic: Norman Krasna's uninspired direction and Olivia de Havilland's age. I've always enjoyed Krasna's writing, finding it charming, witty, and slightly subversive. The script for this movie carries all of the "Krasna touch", but none of this is apparent from the lifeless direction. As a result, jokes were held too long, the actors stood around looking uncomfortable in long-shots, and it wavered between sharp social satire and frothy romantic comedy, touching neither elements successfully. As a result, Olivia de Havilland appears a bit out of place as a 40 year old woman, for the plot and direction kept trying to palm her off as someone 15 years younger. Granted, de Havilland was beautiful and elegant, but she brought too much maturity and groundedness to the type of character who launch such a harebrained scheme and lead John Forsyth on a merry chase across Paris. I would have believed her portrayal of Joan had she been written as a widow or longtime spinster devoted to her father, rather than a sparkling, youngish role in which Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, or Jean Simmons could have filled without a hitch. The rest of the cast gives a game performance, though as stated above, the direction really did them a disservice. Really wasted was Myrna Loy, who was only 10-12 years older than Olivia de Havilland, and was much too luminous and witty to be stuck in such a small part! However, the main issue I had with this film was its inability to make up its mind. By the second half of the film, de Havilland and Forsyth are obviously very smitten, but a series of contrivances keep them apart. I also found the outrageous matchmaking mind-boggling, considering that de Havilland's character clearly had a fiancA© (underused Francis Lederer) who we know nothing about to make us believe he is wrong for de Havilland. Ultimately, the direction, flat jokes, and under-written script leaves this a classic-that-could-have-been, and is a dull point in Krasna's long and celebrated career. 
tt0048944; Norma Krasna has a reputation for being one of the best of Hollywood's script writers, but even he made errors. He was the co-writer, with Groucho Marx, of the tepid play TIME FOR ELIZABETH, which Groucho's fans point at as proof that Groucho had vast literary abilities that he really did not have (based on this play one might say the same about Krasna). THE AMBASSADOR'S DAUGHTER was one of Krasna's errors. It was also one of Edward Arnold's final films. One wishes that Arnold's listing of credits had a better one than this silly comedy.Arnold is playing Ambassador William Fisk of the United States, who is stationed in Paris. He is currently being host to Senator Jonathan Cartwright (Adolph Menjou) and his wife (Myrna Loy). Cartwright is a cantankerous but smart Senator (somewhat isolationist in sentiments - he voted against the St. Lawrence Seaway, and the only country involved in that with us was Canada!). He served in World War I, and remembers how he and his fellow Doughboys had misbehaved in Paris. So he wants to make Paris off-limits to G.I.s. Ambassador Fisk and his friend General Andrew Harvey (Minor Watson) feel this is unfair, but are trying to diplomatically convince the Senator that his views are too draconian. Aiding her father in the matter is Joan Fisk (Olivia De Haviland) who is currently engaged to an older man (Prince Nicholas Obelski - Francis Lederer). The full party are attending an upper class fashion show for charity, which is crashed by two G.I.s: Danny (John Fortsythe) and Al (Tommy Noonan). They start making themselves too visible by mildly ogling some of the young women. When Joan shows up as one of the models, they turn their attention to her. Knowing how Senator Cartwright feels, she decides to make a test of the situation using Danny and Al as guinea pigs. She manipulates Danny into inviting her out on a date (Al is to be sidelined with the assistance of General Harvey). It works too well, of course, as she and Danny fall in love, but Danny believing her to be a French model (or part-time model).I won't go any further in the plot. It's a comedy so one can guess the eventual outcome. It is an old kind of plot, with a socially prominent person mistaken for a plebeian type. The cast does try hard to push the material. Arnold is restricted to a few scenes (his appearance shows his aging and it is just possible that his health was beginning to fail). Watson is also in only a few scenes (best with Noonan). Menjou's perfect delivery of lines remains intact. Witness the scene when he has to help keep Noonan incommunicado, and finds that Noonan is on the phone trying to "get some aspirin" (actually trying to speak to Forsythe). When Noonan hangs up and says that he had a slight headache and needed the aspirin, the smart Menjou says, "In that case, you shouldn't have the phone because it will affect your headache", and he has the phone taken out before Noonan can stop him.Loy is good in a scene that shows her reminiscing about the courtship by Menjou when they were young. She is trying to show De Haviland that Forsythe's behavior is typical of men's behavior in general (like her husband's). It's a good scene, but it reminds one of a better, briefer scene with Fredric March and Theresa Wright in THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES. Forsythe, just starting his career (which included other films like TOPAZ but was mainly on television with DYNASTY and BACHELOR FATHER) gives a good account as a lover. But Noonan really takes acting honors here. He is tagging along with Forsythe for a good time in Paris (precisely what Menjou was warning about) and then finds his hopes for that good time screwed by the test set up by De Haviland, Menjou, and Watson. As he is not the sole target of the test, he has to be controlled, and Watson and Menjou are just the sort to do it. So as the film progresses Noonan gets more and more jittery, to the final part of his performance when he has to race up and down about eight flights of stairs at the Paris Ballet to speak to Forsythe (who took him there) and to Watson, Menjou, Loy, De Haviland, and Arnold. Even as a messenger he is screwed, as he has to report that Forsythe thinks Menjou looked like an old goat (much to Menjou's resentment).Finally the real flaw of the film (outside of the story): De Haviland is charming in her role, but she is not a twenty year old or twenty four year old. In fact (as several have pointed out here) she and Loy look like what they really were - contemporaries. Because of his aging, Arnold does look older than De Haviland, but not older like thirty years. One can make a illogical jump (for the purpose of enjoying the film) accepting her as a younger woman. But it is very hard to do so. 
tt0048944; I encountered this movie again the other evening. This is a quite horrible movie despite a typical but reasonable storyline and a generally wonderful cast. It features great supporting players like Myrna Loy, Adolph Menjou and a longtime favourite Edward Arnold. It could have been a sweet love story had the producers only had the wit to cast a capable young pair as the love interest. But of course two young actors would not have provided the marquee names that some thought necessary to fill those theatre seats. So instead they offered us a 38-year-old John Forsythe as the clever GI and a 40-year-old Olivia de Havilland as the ambassador's daughter, this must rank as one of the worst casting decisions of all time. 
tt0071535; When the screaming stops?!? The screaming NEVER stops, baby! This sadly obscure and obviously cheap-produced gem is an authentic Spanish exploitation highlight and it's about time it gets the appreciation of real horror fans it deserves! Even though more than 30 years overdue, director Amando de Ossorio finally received the much-earned respect for his "Blind Dead" quadrology and I hope that "Lorelei's Grasp" follows soon, as it's as least as fascinating and memorable as the saga of the Templar-zombies. The basic premise of this film is inspired by a terrific ancient myth and centers on a beautiful girl living in a cave underneath the Rhine. When the night falls, Lorelei mutates into a hideous watery creature and sets out to maul defenseless people, as she needs to eat the hearts in order to prolong her own existence. Considering the brutality of the first killing, the concerned teacher of a nearby girls' school insists on hiring a watchman to protect her students and he Â<U+0096> the hunky Tony Kendall Â<U+0096> quickly becomes obsessed with the mysterious Lorelei and, of course, romantically involved with the beautiful teacher. As said, "The Lorelei's Grasp" is a magnificent film! Amando de Ossorio masterfully combines old-fashioned tension with stylish eroticism and really graphic gore. The build up to when the Lorelei-monster mangles another victim is atmospheric and creepy, yet the actual kill is nasty as hell! The decors and filming locations are often breathtaking and every woman that walks through the screen is a genuine beauty, especially Silvia Tortosa in her role as the teacher. There's not a single boring moment in the entire film and even the slightly disappointing finale didn't bother me that much. The monster design and some of the bloody make-up effects will probably seem ridiculous to nowadays CGI-horror fanatics, but they won't be searching for this rare film, anyway. To any other fan of vintage 70's euro-horror, "The Lorelei's Grasp" comes with my highest possible recommendation! 
tt0071535;  This movie is almost as good as Ossorio's blind dead movies (I must add it's even better than Ghostship of the blind dead). It is interesting that it consists of only one man, among many girls. Unusual in films of any genre (except porn).The two best things about this movie are:The monster and its attacks. You really get the picture that the monster is VERY aggressive, and the attacks are FURIOUS! Later on, you will also see a kind of sad twist to the monster's entity.The atmosphere and the setting. There are many intriguing scenes with dreamlike landscapes, a magic and mysterious counterpart to the violence at the mansion.I give this 10 out of 10.
tt0071535; "The Lorelei's Grasp" is sadly hard to find at the moment. The awful re-release "When The Screaming Stops" makes a mockery of the heart of the film, dressing it up as drive-in trash. In it's original version, it's still a bit cheesy, but I think it's a pretty good horror film. The plot centres on beautiful girls at an exclusive school who are being terrorised by a killer...some of the girls are already dead and so the school calls on the help of a handsome bodyguard called Sirgurd to protect the rest of them. Sirgurd has his hands full as all the schoolgirls soon develop a crush on him, but he also has to work out who is responsible for the gruesome murders.Although the English version has terrible dubbing and most available versions are bootleg copies with a poor picture, it's possible to see that there is a good film hiding in here somewhere. The Lorelei creature itself is a bit hokey, but it doesn't hold back on the violence, with lot's of gory chest ripping shots(the Lorelei likes to rip people's hearts out). It also features some beautiful actresses of the period, notably Silvia Tortosa as the heroine, and the fabulous Helga Line as the mysterious beauty who seems connected with the murders somehow. It also has a poetic ending of sorts, and a great dreamy musical soundtrack. This film could gain a lot more appreciation if it was given a re-mastered DVD release. As they have recently done a make-over for the director Amando De Ossorio's "Blind Dead" series, maybe this one could be next? 
tt0071535; According to ancient tradition of seven moons , a horrible creature called Lorelei emerges from river Rhine to eat human hearts . Every night when the moon is full, she turns into a reptile-like monster craving for human blood and begins her criminal rampage .

tt0071535; "According to the legend of the seven moons, Loreley will come out of the river in the form of a filthy beast to devour human hearts that will return her to her sleep of centuries."The film opens with a scaly monster exploding through the windows of a bride-to-be ripping her flesh with it's claws in gory splendor..making no bones about it director Amando de Ossorio sets the viewer up with what his film has in store for those who continue watching. A mythic beast, who takes shape from the Amazonian goddess Helga LinA©(wearing nothing but a lizard green bikini the entire time on screen, which was fine by me), rises from the river to rip the hearts from victims to feed on while an all-girl's school calls on the skills of master-hunter Sigurd(Tony Kendall)to protect them while trying to find and kill it. What eventually occurs is that Sigurd falls in love with the beast in female form, Loreley, as well as the school lovely Professor, Elke(Silvia Tortosa, one of the most beautiful women I've ever laid eyes on), an uptight and proper disciplinarian. Elke, at first, resists her attraction of Sigurd, but eventually lets her hair down. But, Loreley is a jealous "Siren of the Rhine", which will put Elke in jeopardy as Sigurd begins to express his feelings for the professor. Meanwhile, a scientist(Angel MenA©ndez)has studied the myth of Loreley and understands her "condition" from a completely realistic way..with a "radioactive" blade, the doc hopes to "destroy Loreley's cellular mutations and send her back to the dark night of legend from which she has emerged." When Loreley begins attacking in the village nearby the girl's school, the citizens pick up their lighted torches and rifles ready for action. But, under the river is an underground cavernous dwelling which houses the "Treasure of the Nibelungs", taken by Loreley's father Wotan for her to guard. Loreley has plans for Sigurd..he will live with her eternally. Sigurd is torn between killing the beast responsible for mutilated bodies left in it's wake and the love he has for the woman behind the monstrous shell.John Stanley, behind the horror review book CREATURE FEATURES, proclaims that Ossorio utilizes the "kitchen sink" theory in "Loreley's Grasp", which actually is what appeals to me. Plucking elements from various horror films and mythological tales, Ossorio creates this smA¶rgAYsbord of ideas packed in 80 minutes. Filled with eye candy(..lots of lovely ladies to feast our eyes on, including three water nympths who live with Loreley and her guardian grunt, Alberic, portrayed by Franco vet Luis Barboo)and nasty flesh ripping(..including the removal of hearts from torn wounds) Ossorio knew the crowd he was catering to, and delivers a fun exploitation flick using fantasy and the supernatural in a sexy, bold, graphically violent way. Might appeal to fans of "Humanoids of the Deep." The monster is rubber suited, but Ossorio wisely uses mostly point-of-view shots allowing the camera to be it's eyes, only showing the creeping reptilian clawed hands as they prepare to strike their victims. 
tt0071535; The iconic Spanish Horror director Amando De Ossorio is doubtlessly best known for his four 'Blind Dead' films starting with "La Noche Del Terror Ciego" ("Tombs of the Blind Dead") of 1971. "Las Garras De Lorelei" (aka. "The Lorelei's Grasp"/"When the Screaming Stops" of 1974 is yet another great little gem in the man's repertoire, which must not be missed by any Eurohorror fan.The film, which is (very loosely) based on the German Loreley myth and the Niebelungen Mythology, is set in a Village by the Rhine, which is struck by a series of gruesome murders. After a girl has been found with her heart ripped out, some voices claim that the gruesome murder was the deed of the Lorelei, a beautiful woman who turns into a monster by nights and devours human hearts. The hunter Sigurd (Tony Kendall) is assigned as a watchman for a nearby boarding school for (hot) girls, lead by the drop-dead gorgeous teacher Elke (Silvia Tortosa)...Connecting the fascinating Niebelungen myth with Eurohorror simply must result in great entertainment, especially since the man in the director's chair is Amando De Ossorio. It is undeniable that the film has a strong (and charming) camp-factor, but it has just as many moments of genuine creepiness. While the dialogue is sometimes camp and some characters' actions make little sense at times, Ossorio succeeds once again in creating a rich and menacing Gothic atmosphere. The photography and score are great, and the locations and set-pieces are beautifully gloomy. The female cast is full of beautiful women. The Regular redhead Eurohorror beauty Helga LinA© shines in the role of the eponymous she-monster, and looks both incredibly hot and somewhat eerie. Silvia Tortosa, who plays the sexy young teacher, is even more ravishing. Miss Tortosa, who is also known for "Horror Express", must have one of the most impeccably beautiful faces ever seen on screen. The cast includes many regular Eurohorror actors, such as the creepy-looking Luis Barboo, Luis Induni (who also was in many Spaghetti Westerns) and JosA© Thelman ("La Noche Del Terror Ciego"). There is some female nudity, but compared to other contemporary Spanish Exploitation films (such as some by Jess Franco, Paul Naschy,...) the film is rather low on sleaze. As usual for De Ossorio, the gore is very graphic and intense, and very well-made in spite of a low budget.Besides the "Blind Dead" cycle, "Las Garras De Lorelei" is one of Amando De Ossorio's most memorable films, and an eerie and outrageously entertaining little gem that no fan of European Horror should miss. Highly Recommended! 
tt0071535; A Lorelei emerges for a periodic feeding somewhere in Germany, the foxy proprietress of a foxy girl's school full of stone cold foxes hires a "hunter" to take care of the problem. This guy is pretty foxy himself, in a Seventies kind of way, all big sideburns and chest hair and velor sweat-suits. The girls love him. So, in turns out, does the Lorelei herself, who when she isn't going around slicing people up is kinda foxy in her own right. As does her two hot assistants in their secret underground lair (don't ask, it's silly). Violent at times, and there's a whole bit where the screen flashes red when somebody's gonna die Â<U+0096> that's when the screaming's supposed to start, see. Unfortunately doesn't really work out the way it was probably planned: instead of heightening tension it effectively kills it. No, more interesting for the bevy of fine ladies on display (my favorite being Sylvia Tortosa). 
tt0071535;  May contain some small spoilers.I vaguely remember the German folk story about the Siren that lures sailors to shore only kill them and take all their treasure.  To say That I vaguely remember it means that I have heard of it in passing.  It is an intriguing story and to make a horror movie out of it is a pretty good idea.  You have all the settings for a typically frightening shock fest with intangibles like a small sleepy town located on the Rhine River.  The nights are mist-filled and fog covered.  And since there has been something about small ghost towns like this one that have captivated a horror audience, I have to say that this adds nicely to ambiance and potential of the film.  Also typically present in this film is an all girls school that feels threatened by a murder of a young girl and needs protection from the beast that is on the prowl.  In short, there are some very powerful elements working for this film and it has all the ingredients to be a great entry in the horror genre, but ultimately it falls short of achieving greatness and that has to be attributed to the flimsy story, amateur directing and a conclusion that ultimately lets you down.The english translation to this Spanish film is When The Screaming Stops, when really the film is titled Las Garras de Lorelei, which I can only assume means the legend of Lorelei or the revenge of Lorelei or something to that matter.  It was wise to give it a different english name but as I stated earlier, the legend of Lorelei is a very intriguing story and it should be been better than this.  As it stands, the film begins with a young woman brushing her hair, alone at night.  We see a large, scaly hand envelop the screen.  We hear heavy breathing and soon the creature attacks the young woman and tears her apart quite well.  Blood splatters everywhere and her skin is literally excoriated, in quite a gory fashion.  There is little editing here to preserve the appearance of non-violence.  In other words, the Ontario Film Board has not gotten their paws of censorship into this one.  Many times various other films have been hindered because the OFB has deemed the scenes too violent for our fragile little minds to embrace.  And although I have to admit that my wife was looking away in disgust, I was quite impressed with the amount of gore and the quality job they did of making it seem like a heart was being ripped out and that skin was being torn from the body.  So on that level the film is worth seeing.  There are not many films that remain intact--from the directors view-- and straight to us.  Most of the time ( take many of the later Friday the 13th's ) films are cut and then pasted back together, but not this one.Back to the story:  So now the all girls school hires a hunter to hunt down this animal and to protect them.  This is one of those 70's porno-girls schools where the girls don't ever go to class, get giddy at the site of a man, run around in the skimpy bikinis, laugh for absolutely no reason (all of the time) and behave like sex starved kittens from hell.  The only thing we don't have in this film is lots of gratuitous sex.  There is a fair bit of nudity, but only when someone is getting filleted. Now the hunter finally meets a mystery woman that shows up in strange places, first with hooded men that act as body guards and then as a half naked gorgeous looking "siren" that sits on the beach and then flees when he approaches.  Soon enough she reveals to him that she is Lorelei and that she is here to eat people's hearts so that she can survive.  That is all you need to know about the film because as I said, what starts out as an interesting idea is wasted by the inneptitude of all involved. The direction is amateur at best.  To build tension, there is nothing but bushes that shake everytime someone is about to be mangled.  There is no build up and ultimately no pay-off.  You know who is going to die and by the second killing you know that you are going to see the same manner in which it is done everytime.  I have seen some excellent gore in my horror days so watching eight or ten people get their hearts ripped out grows cumbersome and a little boring after the first two or three.As I said, the denouement is absurd and silly.  The film could have been saved had the ending been a little better.  Our fearless hunter has fallen for Lorelei's pulchritude and this has been disguised as love.  And although he has to kill her, he is finding it increasingly difficult to do so, even though she has promised him a life of enslavement and the fact that she has gone onto kill a multitude of towns folk.  Maybe the film can be forgiven because it is Spanish ( no disrespect to Spanish people) and maybe the whole culture and legend of Lorelei is above my comprehension, but lost in all of this is the fact that this is first and foremost a horror film and beyond the blood and gore and dripping hearts, there is nothing horrific about it.5.5 out of 10-- If you come across this film at your local video store, it may be worth a look.  It is, as I said, not the greatest horror film but if you are hoping to one day make a good one, this will show you what not to do.  Anyone can make a model of a human and fill it with blood and organs, but not everyone can emulate John Carpenter ( when he was making Halloween). 
tt0071535; This goofy horror movie is about the Lorelai, a mythical demon that collects people's hearts. Its set in a village where young girls are being slaughtered by the beast. They use a lizard costume with a hood for the creature's visage. The murder attacks look fake enough, like the Lorelai is attacking mannequins. It is fast paced, though, and its silly enough to keep trash fans interested. Directed by Amando Ossorio of the Blind Dead fame. Released in 1985 as When the Screaming Starts where they gave out barf bags, although there really isn't anything barf-worthy in this movie. Lots of good looking naked girls though. This film isn't available on DVD yet. I saw it on the When the Screaming Starts VHS. 
tt0071535; Amando de Ossorio's "The Loreley's Grasp" is a nice mix of art and exploitation, a flavourful and atmospheric tale of a legend proving to be all too real. In Germany, a horrible reptilian beast is on the loose and tearing out hearts from assorted victims. A girls' school hires rugged hunter Sigurd, played by studly Tony Kendall, to act as security guard and beast slayer. However, the beast also takes on a human form, played by the ravishing Helga Line, and Sigurd finds himself drawn to her, even as he sets off sparks with uptight professor Elke (Silvia Tortosa). De Ossorio, best known for the "Blind Dead" series, does a bang up job with this entertaining terror tale, which has an old fashioned sort of story but is set in modern times. This blend of old and new is another element that makes this irresistible, and contrasting each other are the variations in the music score, sometimes it's funky psychedelic stuff, sometimes it's ethereal stuff with mournful chanting on the soundtrack. Adding an interesting touch is the presence of a scientist (Angel Menendez) who's determined to put an end to the legend using scientific means. The actors do good work, especially Line, who would be hard to resist for most any man. The monster itself is especially creepy, and commendably, we never get too good a look at it, but bits and pieces and brief flashes. We also get some juicy bits of gore as the hearts are ripped out, and there is absolutely no shortage of smoking hot young ladies to ogle, the character of Martha is particularly luscious. One thing that really makes this film work is its aura of sadness as the relationship between Sigurd and Loreley plays out, the ending is quite poetic. This film comes highly recommended to any fan of European genre cinema. Eight out of 10. 
tt0040869; If you have the opportunity to catch this one on TV (It's in American Movie Classic's library, I believe, and doesn't appear to be available on video.) and you're a fan of Ernst Lubitsch, don't expect much evidence of his famous "Touch."  Herr Lubitsch died before completing very much of this production and the directing reigns were turned over to Otto Preminger.  Apparently the studio felt that an artist whose ancestral origins shared to some degree those of Mr. Lubitsch was the proper person to complete this project.  My own impression of the final results makes the passing of the talented Mr. Lubitsch a great misfortune for all concerned.  As I watched it on a TV broadcast several years ago I stared in amazement at what seemed an extraordinarily clumsy and heavy-handed attempt to tell what is, essentially, a fairy story for adults.  There are definitely elements to enjoy and Betty Grable is, as always, appealingly lovely in Technicolor and has a lively and natural presence as an actress.  But Mr. Preminger's reputation, without later critically praised films, such as "Anatomy of a Murder," was not greatly enhanced by the final cut of this film. 
tt0040869; I enjoyed this film far more than anything had led me to anticipate, from reading other comments here, I suspect it benefits enormously from being seen on a full-size screen in the cinema, in the company of a cheerful and enthusiastic audience. I was lucky enough to have that experience, borne up on ripples of laughter from all around, and had an immensely good time with this undemanding comedy.For it is as a comedy that it shines, if it shines anywhere at all. The music is nothing special -- in fact, I hadn't realised it *was* a musical, and was very surprised when the assembled ancestors burst into half-spoken lyric -- but I do have to admit that the half-threat, half-promise of 'Oh, what I'll do...' has proved far more catchy than it ever seemed at the time, as it's still going round and round in my head!The plot, such as it is, largely pivots around the past history of the eponymous Francesca, a sixteenth-century portrait sporting a distinctly anachronistic hairstyle and fur-coat. Her idea on the sanctity of marriage don't quite jibe with those of her distant descendant, the Countess Angelina, and one can almost hear the storyline creaking at the seams under the strain of the Production Code in order to ensure that the heroine arrives unsullied in her much-delayed marriage-bed with the right man...The romance is scarcely earth-shattering, and in fact the first few scenes, played pretty well straight, verge on the tedious. But where script and film really come to life is in the battle of the sexes that follows. The impudence of Douglas Fairbanks Jr's courtship of Betty Grable's married Angelina is equalled only by Betty-Grable-as-Francesca's pursuit of him in turn, culminating in complete role-reversal in the hilarious fantasy sequence where she -- literally -- sweeps him off his feet. This is probably the comic climax of the plot, although the consequences of the Colonel's understandable confusion are worked out with a deft touch in the remaining two 'acts' of the operetta-structure, and the spectacle of Fairbanks' blissful, bemused awakening is more or less worth the price of admission on its own.Grable is entirely convincing in establishing her two contrasting characters, wisely gets almost all the (limited) singing opportunities, and shares the honours where the swathes of quotable dialogue in the various verbal duels are concerned. But in the field of unspoken reaction she is really outclassed by her male supporting leads, Fairbanks in particular is an absolute treat in a number of wordless sequences whose set-up and humour is worthy of the silent screen.This film is too uneven in style to be a classic, varying from sparkling repartee to hackneyed tedium. But at its best it is quite honestly very funny indeed, and brought a round of spontaneous applause and laughter across the auditorium at the end as the lights went up. Out of tune with its times, it may have failed to draw contemporary audiences -- but, on this showing, really didn't deserve to be disowned by both Grable and Preminger, the (uncredited) director. This is no masterpiece, but a thoroughly entertaining minor work, and I for one found myself grinning in remembrance all the way home. 
tt0040869;  In 1948 this was my all-time favorite movie. Betty Grable's costumes were so ravishing that I wanted to grow up to be her and dress like that.  Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., was irresistible as the dashing Hungarian officer. Silly and fluffy as this movie might appear at first, when I was eight years old it seemed to me to say something important about relations between men and women. I saw it again the other day, I was surprised to find that it still did. 
tt0040869; THE LADY IN ERMINE certainly has its moments, but it can't decide if it wants to be a romance or a comedy. Parts of it are very funny indeed and had me laughing out loud, while others seem to fall as flat as a lead balloon.Douglas Fairbanks Jr. is handsome and dashing, as usual, providing a much needed surge of energy when he is on screen, but Betty Grable seems uncomfortable in her double role. She's far more enjoyable to watch as the ancestor than she is as the descendant. The opportunity for her to display her most valuable assets (her legs) is limited.20th Century Fox has surrounded the two leads with good character actors from its stable, including Cesar Romero showing some versatility, Walter Abel in two roles, and Harry Davenport as the likable old retainer. Reginald Gardiner is wasted as Alberto.It's a shame that the songs are so ordinary and mostly forgettable. Was this the best Fox, the studio that brought us STATE FAIR, could do? All in all, you're not missing much if you don't see it, but it's a pleasantly diverting way to pass an hour and thirty minutes. 
tt0040869; Watching That Lady In Ermine I was wondering what Betty Grable was doing in a project that seemed to be aimed for Marlene Dietrich to do. Someone over at 20th Century Fox may have decided one sex symbol is as good as another. Darryl F. Zanuck should have known better.Betty plays a 19th century Italian countess whose domain has been invaded by a troop of Hungarian Hussars captained by Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. Her ghostly ancestor whose portrait hangs in the palace hall along with the rest of her distinguished family tree, sees no small resemblance in Doug now and another invader some 300 years earlier whom she dealt with when armies failed.Besides that the current Betty has just been married to Cesar Romero and the invasion has come at a most inopportune moment, before things have been consummated. That's going to give anyone a bad attitude, I guarantee.Fresh, wholesome all American Betty is NOT the actress to do seductive and mysterious. Marlene Dietrich might have put this over, but with Betty it falls flatter than yesterday's presidential candidate. She and Fairbanks have no chemistry at all, though Doug is as charming as ever and someone I can watch in anything.Frederick Hollander and Leo Robin wrote the score for this film and This Is The Moment got an Oscar nomination for Best Song. That Lady In Ermine's one chance for Oscar glory fell to Buttons And Bows.Ernest Lubitsch died midway during the film and Otto Preminger finished That Lady In Ermine. I can't believe Lubitsch had Grable in mind for the lead here. Neither will you if you see That Lady In Ermine. 
tt0040869; Betty Grable is "That Lady in Ermine" in this 1948 musical, also starring Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Cesar Romero, Reginald Gardner, and Walter Abel.Frankly, it's hard for me to believe that Lubitsch directed this. And in fact, he died eight days into production and the film was finished by Otto Preminger. The story is taken from a 1922 musical, and originally Lubitsch wanted Jeanette MacDonald for the role, Zanuck wanted Gene Tierney, finally Irene Dunne and Charles Boyer were announced, but it didn't happen.Grable has a dual role here, as Angelina in 1861 and her ancestor Francesca, from 1561, whose portrait hangs in the great hall. Angelina has just been married to Count Mario, who, as soon as they get into her quarters, is called to action against Hungarian invaders. The Hungarians also invaded 300 years ago, and Francesca was able to save the castle. Can her ancestor do it again, in spite of feeling attracted to the handsome colonel (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.)? The film takes us into the past and back into the present, and it's a lush, gorgeous production. Grable's gowns are exquisite, and she looks gorgeous. Someone here noted she was past her prime (at the ripe old age of 31) and a little plump. She sure didn't look it to me, she looks fantastic. The color in the film is eye-popping as well.There is really no music to speak of, except for a couple of songs that are continually repeated. There are some funny bits, and it's a fine cast. The ancestors step out of their portraits and come to life, and at one point, Fairbanks is dubbed and sings gloriously in an operatic tenor voice. Fairbanks is wonderful, Grable is perhaps a little too vanilla for the role, but she gives the role a youthful energy. Other than Tierney, the other stars, who were legit sopranos, were a bit older. The story, what there was of it, really needed the lightness Grable gave it.See it for incredible color and costumes and a fine cast. The music and the story aren't of much consequence - it's nice postwar fluff. 
tt0040869;  I really enjoyed this Lubitsch movie with Betty Grable. It made quite a change from her usual "musicals", and I cannot again understand why there have been no videos or DVDs made of it. Younger viewers who don't even know who Betty Grable is will surely appreciate this Lubitsch movie. Here's hoping! 
tt0040869; Let me start out by saying that I used to really like Betty Grable, particularly from "Down Argentine Way", but by the time she got around to this disaster, she had also got "round" and frankly the whole film was an embarrassment. Costarred with Douglas Fairbanks JNr (who must have been fairly desperate) the story was bad, the colours good, and the film far too long. It had some of the old standbys in it like Harry Davenport and Reginald Gardiner to try and stimulate interest but with no success. The music score was woeful, and I have to say not one tune was memorable in any way....as I was such a fan of Miss Grable, I always wish I had never seen this one! 
tt0040869; Lubitsch's last film - completed by an inept Preminger - is a remake of BRIDE OF THE REGIMENT _ a 1930 all two -strip Technicolor film, starring Walter Pidgeon, Vivienne Segal and Myrna Loy - which is now lost - although the Vitaphone disc soundtrack survives at UCLA.This was in turn derived from a stage musical entitled THE LADY IN ERMINE by Lonsdale and Wood, adapted from an operetta, DIE FRAU IM HERMELIN by Schanzer and Welisch.It drags badly and Grable is as inept as Fairbanks is fabulous, doing all the work here, full of life and vitality, taking the Lubitsch direction perfectly. It is tired Lubitsch and rather dull and boring during most of its length, although it perks up occasionally. Interesting more as an artifact than a film. 
tt0040869; This movie is a fun low-pressure comedy. It uses dry wit... people who can't process that type of humor might not enjoy the movie as much. The costumes are lavish, the colors are vivid, and Betty Grable looks hot as always.To see an interesting breech of continuity, watch Betty Grable's high-heels change into completely different shoes midway through her dance (roughly 1:01 into the movie). It was likely intended to protect her from injury during the acrobatic moves, but it is surprising that so little effort went into matching the alternate shoes with the originals. 
tt1206283; Okay, now I'm not exactly sure how to put it. I just returned watching the great showman's latest presentation "Black and White" and I am pretty muddled up because I have very mixed reaction to the film. Perhaps I am the only one contented out of the 17 who turned up for the show, or this film has been badly victimized of bad publicity and lack of good starcast. I say bad starcast because I am sure I felt exactly the same sitting there in the couch and watching the promos, but I did not know I would be proved so wrong once I watched the movie.Kudos to Subhash Ghai for picking a subject like this who otherwise took great pleasure in doing musicals targeted towards NRIs. I suppose this is very different as it has very less to do about life outside India and speaks more bravely of matters that have not been quite able to grab the attention of big film studios. Not that Yashraj (phew!) did terrorist movies like Fanaa and Red Chillies did Main Hoon Na, but this latest attempt is more subjected and particularly tackling to the main theme of the movie Â<U+0096> global terrorism. Kudos once again to a setting that not for once you realise you're being shown a "commercial" (mind the term here) movie, yet at the end of the day it leaves you feeling that it has hit the spot.The movie served another good purpose to me as I was able to re-cherish my moments I spent in Chandni Chowk. I was there for a fortnight in 2005 so I was like "oh that's Shishgunj Sahib" and "look at the spot we had kulfis" through the movie. Quite mesmerizing though. However, I think Ghai has very well justified as why the movie should've been there and not anywhere else.Character wise, debutant Anurag Sinha fits in very well Â<U+0096> be it the first scene where he's shown recording a TV feed or the later ones where he shoots. His serious, calm look is very intimidating though charming. Good find, Mr. Ghai! Anil Kapoor shows he is a good actor and not someone irritating like in Tashan trailer. I mean, we were shown Tashan's trailer before the film started, and later when Anil appears in this Black and White movie Â<U+0096> just look at his versatility. At times when Anil himself is into curves and six packs, it indeed takes a lot of guts to get grey sideburns and glasses and perform with equal dignity and vigour. The new girl does not convince and I doubt if she'll go very far. However, Shefali Shah once again proves her metal. A very good work there but the one who steals the show is undoubtedly the old poet who is both charming and inspiring. Milind Gunaji cannot be remembered for the role. Scenic wise it's again so-so. You can't expect lot of scenic beauty for hazy Delhi plus the pollution. Music is okay, not a very good choice for repeated listens. Nice driving of the story, but whatever that makes me feel like taking back all the good words I've said so far is the screenplay Â<U+0096> believe me, I found it haunting.I specially remember two over-the-top scenes: 1) where Anurag has to choreograph a shootout to win over Shefali Shah's confidence, and 2) the scene where Shefali dies and Anil Kapoor overacts. Notwithstanding that, I would definitely recommend this story to any sensible movie lover and ask them to try it at least once.I expect more of similar works from the great Showman who finally seems to have realised that he is indeed falling down and needed to take some serious steps to reclaim his image in the industry. 
tt1206283; I saw at the beginning that it was a Mukta Arts movie. Given the history of the banner, that could lead me to expect a lot. Look at the sweet part Anil Kapoor got in Taal. And here's Anil again, with Shefali Shah this time. I always look forward to seeing her.Short answer is that this movie isn't that good. The music is no more than average. The script is very awkward a good deal of the time. The plot asks a lot from your credulity. Just one blatant example is when they want to get the protagonist close to the Urdu professor, they fake a terrorist attack and then have him rescue the professor's cute young daughter. For that plan to work, the kid has to wander away from her parents. Since the kid isn't IN on the plan, they seem awfully lucky that she somehow gets separated on cue.Anurag Sinha, who plays the terrorist, is certainly a kid with some potential, but how great it is doesn't show in this movie. Compare him with J. D. Chakravarthy in Satya and it becomes obvious what I mean. Satya had the same kind of protagonist, but the director did ten times as much with the same sort of personality.Also, to me this is a different angle on the Dil Se story, but having Dil Se makes this movie look like a comedown.It might be worth one look, but no more. 
tt1206283; "Black and White" directed by Subhash Ghai is about a Muslim terrorist from Afghanistan who aspires to come to India and cause a Hindu massacre. Anurag Sinha, who plays this role, looks as shady and dangerous as the role permits him to, from the moment he first steps out of that train ,into Delhi. He lives undercover in a friend's house, changing his identity so that he's not discovered. All the Muslims around seem to know his secret, although they don't know how mean and fanatical he is. This is a man purely acting on revenge, and not reason. Anyways, Anil Kapoor plays a kind-hearted professor that has a lot of tolerance. You can imagine when he is Hindu and has the Quran memorized. Now, the regular Indian clichA©d plot of this movie would be that Anil Kapoor influences the terrorist so much with his compassion and love, that the terrorist doesn't end up bombing the Hindu temple and killing all those people. Although the movie works towards this ending, the terrorist doesn't. Sinha's face is pretty much that of a terrorist: his expression is dead serious. I can't imagine him hugging anyone or even smiling. It looks so ridiculous when Aditi Sharma (a Muslim girl who loves him) imagines them running around on a train, hugging and laughing at each other. The general fantasy and dreamy spirit that wells up inside of me when listening to such songs, wasn't thereÂ it didn't work as well as I wanted it to. 
tt1206283; Black & White Â<U+0096> Subhash Ghai returns after the debacle of "Kisna". But unfortunately I was again disappointed and found the Ghai spark missing in the movie. In fact, I am quite surprised why the filmmakers keep on using the same plot again & again even when they know that it has been exploited before by others in the industry. We all have seen the plot of "Inviting a new person to live in your house which in disguise is a terrorist and a suicide bomber" used many time before also. The main source behind the inspiration is "The Devil's Own" which came in 1997 starring Harrison Ford as the house owner & Brad Pitt as the guest. It was followed by Raj Kanwar's "Baadal" released in 2000, in which Amrish Puri played the host and Bobby Deol was the terrorist. We also witnessed the similar kind of thing in the second half of Maniratnam's "Dil Se" (1998) which had Manisha Koirala, staying in Shahrukh's house. And now again it is repeated in "Black & White".Subhash Ghai surely moves ahead with an offbeat and an unusual track for Mukta Arts and he has broken his own old pattern of film-making with this venture. But its quite questionable why he chose a story which has similarities with many other movies. The film lacks the grip from the first half hour itself and then the only engrossing aspect is the music which comes as a background theme in many scenes. The screenplay is predictable from the first scene and the viewer also cannot relate to the secular them in a big way.The only impressive elements in the film are : 1. The unmatchable act by well know theater activist Habeeb Tanvir as the old poet. 2. And the Soul Stirring music by Sukhwinder Singh. In fact this is the first time I am impressed with this music for a film soundtrack. Way to go SukhwinderÂ Keep it up.. Subhash Ghai undoubtedly has a gifted ear for good music which he has proved again with this latest offering.Anil Kapoor is impressive and establishes himself as veteran actor in the industry who can be a strong pillar for any project. The debutant Anurag Sinha is a good find, but he has got not much to do and only has to give the starring looks according to the his role most of the times. So he can be judged better when he emotes, fights and dances in his next movie. Shifali Chhaya is loud at some places and the rest of the cast just OK.The climax is the major letdown. The similar kind of climax you may recall in "Dil Se" and "Hu Tu Tu" when the suicide bomber is heading towards a national meeting place on 15th August or 26th January. Chandni Chowk and Heritage Sites in Delhi are the new craze in Hindi Films now a days. The best part remains the music by Sukhwinder Singh, though he borrows a lot from the Punjabi Traditional Music Treasure, still I will rate it as his best work for a film soundtrack till date. In simple words, its Subhash Ghai's attempt towards a different kind of cinema. He excels in parts no doubt, but I wish he had chosen a virgin topic for this move. Watch it for Habib TanveerÂ and do listen to its complete soundtrackÂ Rating : 2 / 5 
tt1206283; i am a hardcore horror/thriller/mystery fan, and watch very few movies belonging to other genres. I watched this movie only because it had a theme which was very fresh in the minds of all Indians..."The Terrorist Attack on the Delhi..." and i must say i enjoyed every bit of this movie. a thought provoking, heart wrenching movie... Anil Kapoor was at his best in this film. He portrayed the role of a moralistic Urdu professor with such A©lan and elegance that i was amazed. The scene that i felt best was the one when Anil comes to know his wife was dead and in spite of being totally shattered and shocked, he asks his daughter not to cry as that might lead to Hindu-Muslim riots !!!! Amazing!!! Watch it and enjoy it!!i am sure u will!!! I will highly recommend it to everyone who likes intelligent movies.. a 9.5/10 rounded off to 10/10 !!!! 
tt1206283; I didn't expect much from this, just another film about terrorism. But saying that it was very good and heart-warming film. It wasn't against Muslim's or Pakistan as some movies, but showed what terrorists believe and that this world isn't simply black and white. The songs were nice to listen to, and the acting was overall quite good. The film didn't drag at places. Being a Muslim i liked the fact that the true meaning of jihad and how Muslim's should behave was shown. Overall a very entertaining movie which kept my attention throughout and had a really good message. For an Indian movie it was quite well made, but this is what is expected from a great director like Subhash Ghai. 
tt1206283; Subhash Ghai's Black & White is an amateurish effort from a filmmaker clearly out of his depth as far as his subject matter is concerned. The film follows the story of a suicide bomber who seeks refuge in the home of an unsuspecting professor, while all along involved in a plot to blow-up the Red Fort. Loosely inspired by the Harrison Ford-Brad Pitt starrer The Devil's Own, Ghai's film explores the relationship between a terrorist and the couple who open their home and their hearts to him. Well-intended the film may be, but at plot level itself there's a fundamental flaw with Black & White, and that flaw is the writer-director's sheer inability to set the tone of the film. Opening on a note that's so pretentious you want to puke, Ghai uses redundant symbolismÂ<U+0097>like a child with a candleÂ<U+0097>to make a point that's been made so many times before. To top that, his every character is a caricature that spouts clichA©s instead of dialogues. Take Anil Kapoor playing the Urdu professor, for instance. How you cringe at those long sermons he delivers, and then his shameless hamming, especially in that scene where the professor returns home one night to discover a horrible brutality committed on his wife. Not that Shefali Shah, playing the professor's activist wife is much better. Hysterical for the most part, she's so over-the-top even in comic and supposedly emotional scenes, you want to remind her, this is film not street theatre where melodrama can be used to great effect. Newcomer Anurag Sinha, who plays the mysterious stranger with dishonourable intentions, has an arresting screen presence, undeniably, but straitjacketed in a loosely developed role he has little scope to really perform Â<U+0097> unless you count his brooding and that 'angry young man' impression as a performance. Black & White falls like a pack of cards because it's meant to be a serious, even realistic film, a departure from Ghai's trademark masala musicals. But problem is the director is so unfamiliar and uncomfortable with minimalism that he cannot resist the urge to throw in some of his typical formulas, as a result delivering a film that is both confused and sloppy. Look at that presumably symbolic scene in which a deaf-mute child plays out a patriotic tune on her piano to a man just hours away from committing a ghastly act of terror. Or that supposedly comic scene in which an elderly poet makes repeated telephone calls to the professor's home late one night. Or even that indulgent dream song between the terrorist and the young student who's clearly falling for him. The sad thing is, for a film that was meant to address an issue, Black & White doesn't say anything that you don't already know. The film makes only token nods to patriotism, and if you ask me, I'd say the very themes of terrorism, patriotism and nationalism are just incidental to Ghai's story which is in fact, about the power of goodness and love which can convert even the serious non-believers. And that, my friends, let's not forget, is one of mainstream Bollywood's oldest and favourite themes. So you see Ghai never ventured too far from his comfort zone anyway.It's a miscalculation in every sense of the word, a film that makes Kisna and Yaadein seem watchable. When it comes to Subhash Ghai, I'd much rather watch his masala musicals any day. 
tt0236167;  Remember Koji Yakusho from SHALL WE DANCE, UNAGI (THE EEL), CURE or TAMPOPO? The Japanese box-office star is the new magistrate in a corrupt town who spreads rumours about his negligence and dubiosity only to get rid of all the bad guys he has to face and who underestimate him then completely. Dora-heita is an example for a streetwise and easy living guy with the classic abilities of a samurai - although he is making fun of them. The sword fighting seems to be classic but is hidden in camera movements, cuts and other tricks because Yakusho hasn't got the presence and fighting abilities of a Toshiro Mifune. The film was planned long ago by the four famous directors Kurosawa, Kinoshita, Kobayashi and Ichikawa who formed Yonki-no-kai (The Committee of Four Knights) in 1969 and wrote the script together. Only after three of them had died, Ichikawa could finally make his 74th movie out of their script.  
tt0236167; The City of Horisoto is in bad shape. It's full of gamblers, thieves, prostitutes, smugglers, drug addicts, and Yakuza. At the center of this are three bosses who each control different aspects of the Hirosoto underworld, specifically Bosses Taju, Saibei, and Nadahachi. Magistrate Dora-Heita is dispatched by his lord to clean up the City... and possibly the local government as well. The only problem is Dora-Heita is infamously known as a drunken, debauched, samurai with unusual tactics (to say the least). Will he be able to clean up the City or is he just-as his reputation suggests-a philandering, gambling, drunkard?Although produced in 2000, Dora-Heita is truly a product of the late 60's. Written by the "Four Musketeers" (Akira Kurosawa, Kon Ichikawa, Keisuke Kinoshita and Masaki Kobayshi) in 1969, and directed by the last surviving member of the troop, Kon Ichikawa. The film's script sat around for 30 years until Kon decided to commit the text to celluloid. For those reasons, the film closely resembles 60's Chambara in form and tone. Those familiar with Kon Ichikawa and Akira Kurosawa will know what to expect, and they won't be disappointed.But for those who aren't familiar with the works of Kurosawa and Ichikawa I will elaborate. Dora-Heita is a slow but correspondingly paced samurai epic. Don't be expecting a non-stop slaughter-fest or you'll be disappointed. The film actually only features one true sword fight(which is incredible) and if your only in it to see the obligatory blood splatter from sword strokes... than this isn't your film. In fact, Dora-Heita doesn't even enter the City until the film hits its 45 minute mark. Dora-Heita's true allure is in its direction, dialog, plot, and acting. Kon Ichikawa's direction is excellent and typical of early Chambara. Kurosawa fans will be especially delighted to catch shades of the late masters great repartee throughout the film. The plot is also reminiscent of Kurosawa's dual masterpieces Yojimbo and Sanjuro, (although Dora-Heita isn't on the same level as those masterpieces). And Koji Yakusho is great as the cryptically competent Magistrate Koheita (a.k.a. Dora-Heita). On top of everything, the film has some pretty funny comedic elements to it too, I found myself chuckling throughout at Koheita's exploits. Add all these qualities up and you have a very fun and involving film.The film does have some minor faults. The plot might be a little too much like Yojimbo for it's own good. Some scenes run on a little long, and sometimes the dialog becomes a bit superfluous.Bottom Line- Not an outright Masterpiece, but a damn fun two hours. 
tt0236167; Because a film may have some comedic elements it does not make it a comedy or even a funny movie. We often have amusing scenes to "break the tension" in "serious" ventures. This was neither of the above - not a comedy, not a "serious" film.Nor was this a Chambara film. There was swordplay, but the artistry of the blade was missing, and, there was but one scene where steel was drawn.So, we are left with a story of a sheriff who comes to town, and cleans the place up. I mean Samurai. It's your typical Eastern-Western that holds no surprises and our hero never needs to reload his blade.It could be that the collaboration of four of Japan's greatest directors makes this film a bit of this and a bit of that and a lot of disappointment. 
tt0236167; Another project from the files of Kurosawa gets completed, this time by master director Kon Ichikawa who co-wrote it with Kurosawa and other directors during an aborted attempt to create an independent film company in the early 1970's.A samurai is sent to be the new magistrate of a very corrupt fiefdom. Never reporting in to his office, the samurai immediately creates the impression that he's about as immoral a samurai as one can be without killing or abusing anyone. He insults the chamberlain and head officials of the fief and spends most of his time gambling and carousing with prostitutes. All the while he's really investigating how the local yakuza are working in league with the lords of the fiefdom. While this is a very amusing film and quite enjoyable for most of it's length, it's not a deep movie. However, the humor is good and the action is well handled. It's a good looking production with one minor drawback. The anticipated sword fight showdown happens (it's a very good scene) but the film then goes on for another twenty minutes so all the loose ends can be tied up. I didn't mind but it felt lop-sided.Recommended. 
tt0236167; A late film from Kon Ichikawa, approximately the eightieth in his sixty-year directing career. An honest magistrate uses guile as well as samurai skills to clean up a corrupt feudal fiefdom. The tale is framed by two scribes recording the "official" version of events: their ironic comments are funny as they gossip about all the juicy stuff they have to leave out of their chronicle, but behind their worldly-wise cracks, they really don't know what's going on, so the irony doubles back on them. The hero plays a shifty game going after his prey, his dodges are very amusing, and the star Koji Yakusho really seems to be enjoying himself. The corrupt port city, a medieval Big Easy, is a big rotten playground in nacreous colors that bleed into each other. About the only hard edges to be seen - until the blades come out - are the checkerboard squares on the robe of the determined Miss Keiko, who pursues the magistrate all the way from Edo. Ichikawa keeps his touch light and sure - what other great director has aged so well? - his mastery intact, with no sign of faltering or hardening. 
tt0236167; This film begins with a new magistrate being appointed. He's apparently the fourth appointed in the last year in this film set in the feudal period in Japan. Past magistrates were frustrated by the in-grained corruption and gave up--but this one is a bit different--he ALREADY is corrupt."Dora-heita" was an enjoyable film but I can't help but think that I was always expecting more--like there would be some amazing resolution to make it all magical or at least more interesting. That's because you know that the incompetent debaucher is going to eventually spring his trap and reveal himself to be a gifted and powerful foe. But, while this eventual unveiling occurs, it all just seemed quite anticlimactic. Also, the action, sometimes was pretty good (such as when Dora-heita fought guys with swords with only his bare hands or a knife), at other times seemed a bit second-rate as well. And, oddly, there wasn't any blood. Overall, it's okay... 
tt0236167; someone calls this a detective story, and that is apt. the film reminds me very much of an American detective tale, something hammett might have written, but it is effortlessly translated into another world, one of swords and sake. there is one point, a night shot, when the magistrate has first entered the corrupt town he is to clean up, and the camera catches faces that reek of depravity, hopelessness, vacancy, these are the seedy, misbegotten, down-and-out characters of a low rent street of burst dreams, it is an almost noir shot of the underbelly. for a moment you are in some other movie, a bleaker seemingly more modern place where concrete hems the characters in and no escape exists. it is a very western shot in the value judgments it makes for the viewer. the shot is jarring and you never have to ask again why this place needs to be cleaned up.the main characters come off with a western outlook quite often. the geisha who tracks the magistrate is a regular hell-on-wheels girl who knows about life and has the bit in her teeth - maybe almost a harlow part. the magistrate really lacks the veneration and gravity you will find in any similar Japanese movie that features clans, a hierarchy, bushido, men of status and the formality normally associated with samurai society. the protagonist is a trickster and an irreverent scoffer. it is nearly sam spade looking for lew archer's killer.i found the flic to be a really nice mix of western attitudes and samurai story in a comedic melange that was not in the least bit overdone or offsetting.i give it a seven because i didn't "love" the movie, but i did like it a lot and will watch it again. 
tt0236167; As a random pick from the shelves of a Japanese DVD store, largely chosen simply on the basis of having English subtitles and the words 'Kon Ichikawa' in big roman letters, the list of names attached to Dora-heita comes as quite a surprise, though it never really stacks up against the best work of any of its four writers. Which is not to say it's a bad film, far from it. It is, though, a rather uneven one...The story is solid enough, Mochizuki Koheita is the newly appointed magistrate in a small rural fiefdom, sent to clean up the corrupt town of Horisoto in his own unorthodox way, facing off against a trio of gang bosses and the complacent and complicit council. In the lead, Koji Yakusho plays the part perfectly, making Koheita both genuinely likable and credibly hard-nosed. Support ranges from the fairly good to the utterly mediocre, though none of the actors come off too badly. The strongest scenes of the film are those set in the streets of Horisoto, Mochizuki's first visit to the slum being the most striking sequence in terms of visual flair. Elsewhere, there are a few great scenes, the visit to Nadahachi's abode in particular, despite the paint-by-numbers action scene that follows.It's certainly a film with plenty to keep the viewer's attention, but it never really coagulates into a sleek, unified whole. There are problems with some of the comedy elements and with the Kosei character, both of which feel as though they were shoehorned in at the last minute, in the misguided fear of putting off viewers with too serious a story. In actual fact, it would probably be possible to cut Kosei out completely, contrary to expectations, she actually has no connection at any point to the main thread of the story, instead providing only a couple of laughs, an underwhelming brawl with some smugglers and a penultimate scene that errs the wrong side of ridiculous.Still, it's entertaining enough, though it'd be best not to have too high expectations simply because of the names on the screenplay... 
tt0120378;  I've seen the movie long ago, however, few days ago (and it's late sept 2004) something reminded me of it. Doesn't matter much, local politics... Still, Pintilie went beyond the art-fancy-sophisticated movie maker style he had so well embraced before. In "prea tirziu" he shows a brutal reality, a strange kind of reactions, bad persons, bad relations, bad values (if there is such a thing), bad everything... And he shows it in a good way. Watch it closely, even though you are not accustomed to the Romanian style, observe some people that exist - of course, not that dramatically, but still - and think that this can happen today, somewhere not far from us.It's not Romania, it's not the real stuff, but it's about some people that exist. Somehow, this drama is a comedy. And I definitely suggest you to watch it. You won't regret it.  
tt0120378;  Lucian Pintilie's film is an exploration of the life of the miners disguised as a thriller.  The events of the infamous "mineriada" - when in June 1990 miners attacked peaceful protesters in Bucharest and have been thanked by Romanian president Iliescu - are not the main focus of the film but they do provide a background as well as a starting point for the film.  Pintilie does not try to excuse the behavior of the miners but he does try to see what makes people behave in such an appalling way.  His alter ego in the film is the investigator, a young and inexperienced Dumitru Costa brilliantly portrayed by Razvan Vasilescu who tries to uncover crimes committed in the mine and discovers a myriad of corruption.  This allows Pintilie to show the difficult, often dehumanizing life of the miners. The film is full with unforgettable grim images such as the scene of a dead body coming in a conveyor belt.  While being critical to the behavior of the miners, Pintilie also shows a remarkable sympathy for those who work in such difficult conditions.  But do the victims of the "mineriada" agree? Nonetheless Pintilie makes clear that there is no hope for life and even the idealistic investigator ultimately chooses the way of exile. 
tt0120378; Romanian director Lucian Pintilie's film "Trop Tard" starts in Germany with three young violin players and ends in Romania.We are shown that these talented musicians cannot bathe themselves due to acute water shortage as taps run dry.This is something which normally happens in third world countries but some communist countries of Europe are no exception to this rule.In some of these early scenes, there is a real sense of constant movement,a desire to escape bitter,harsh realities of Romania.This feeling of evasion is very much evident throughout the entire film.In Prea tAcrziu,(Trop Tard/Too late)Lucian PintiliA© exposes miserable plight of hapless miners who are at the mercy of corrupt mining officials.Too late is also a story about guilty conscience.It is more of an exposA© about corruption than being a detective story involving a public prosecutor who is determined to solve a difficult case of two dead miners.PintiliA© tells us that it is too late for some communist societies as things should have been corrected a long time ago.The film send us a message that there is an imminent need to change the ways a communist society functions. 
tt0120378; An incredible piece of trash, with cheeky "artsy" pretensions.The cardboard myth, the cinematic Potemikiniade, the clay-footed colossus that is Lucian Pintilie shows again his hideous and incompetent face.He was once upon a time, several decades ago, a talented theater director and a promising movie-maker - but he never had the resources to substantiate his career. He simply has no grasp of what the cinematographic aesthetics MEAN. He believes that filmic art is synonymous with hysteria, brutality, vulgarity - and, oh yes, exhibitionism! If he doesn't command the actors to take all their clothes off and parade their nakedness in front of himself and the camera, he doesn't feel he's alive! This scabrous piece of film about the Romanian miners is one of the most amateurish and trivial he ever made. It's amazing, how certain semidoctes can achieve intellectual orgasms by watching this worthless insult to decent cinema. 
tt0120378; It's a well known fact that the 10 years break between "Reconstituirea" and "De ce trag clopotele, MiticA¤?" was fatal to Lucian Pintilie, making him lose his movie-touch in a terminal way, his last sparks in cinema being noticed in "Balanta" and "O varA¤ de neuitat" - two movies that contained a few good scenes. Unfortunately, the shameful "Prea tAcrziu" is only the beginning of the author's final decline...While fancying to attempt an in-depth analysis of Romanian society of the '90s, the story only juggles with some opportunist concepts, speculating in a gratuitous and expositive way the painful impact of the so-called "Mineriades". The conclusion is ridiculously hysteric: Romanian people turned into an underground killing beast, hungry for blood, for whose redemption it's "too late"...The directing is primitively-violent, using cheap naturalist tactics that try to pose as "style". And Pintilie's personal obsession for full frontal male nudes, showing their genitals without the least aesthetic or semantic legitimacy, reaches here nightmarish proportions... We are deeply sorry, but NOT EVERYBODY is fascinated by staring between the legs of naked men, thank you very much! 
tt0368375; I recently saw this film as part of the Cinemuerte Horror Film Festival in Vancouver, on the closing night, and it was a great way to wrap up the final year of that particular festival."Trouble" is one of those thrillers that you wouldn't want to give away too much about, suffice it to say that the main character, Matyas, is a photographer with a wife and adolescent kid, who one day discovers that he has a twin brother! The film has elements of Hitchcock and Cronenberg, and is well shot and acted, and well paced. Even the music lends an element of tension to the way things unfold in the film. You easily get caught up in Matyas' circumstances, and his slow, gradual revealing of his murky past as a child, and how his twin, Thomas, figures into that.A great Euro thriller! Hopefully, it'll arrive in North America soon on DVD, or in theatres. Definitely worth checking out. 
tt0368375; The photographer and family man Matyas (BenoA®t Magimel) is married and has a happy life with his beloved wife Claire (Natacha RA©gnier), who is pregnant and near the delivery, and his young son Pierre (Nathan Lacroix). Matyas was raised in an orphanage, and he believes his mother died when he was six. However, he receives a correspondence and discovers that his mother has just passed away and that he has a twin brother, Thomas. Matyas does not recall his childhood with his mother and brother and has problems with blood. When Thomas visits his family, Matyas becomes paranoid, believing that his sibling wishes to takeover his family."Trouble" is a great and dark thriller, with a weird suspenseful and original story that recalled me the style of David Cronenberg and Dario Argento. The screenplay is open regarding the accident with Thomas Â<U+0096> it is never clear whether Thomas self-inflicted the mutilation or Matyas did. The rage and feelings of Thomas together with the fact that Matyas was abandoned by his family seem to indicate that Matyas was the responsible, but the attitude of their father also seems to indicate that Thomas was abused by him. Anyway, the plot is dark, the cinematography and the special effects are excellent and the performance of BenoA®t Magimel is top-notch. The final twist was really unexpected and I do not understand why some people compares this film with other movies with twins (like for example Bette Davis' "Dead Ringer" or David Cronenberg's "Dead Ringers"). My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Duplicidade" ("Duplicity") 
tt0368375; The film has a very interesting story. I found all players very successful. However, i think there were 2 points in the story which i could not understand: 1- At the beginning we had the impression that when Matyas was together with Elina in the dark room, Thomas went to Matyas's home and beat his wife. Then we find out that Elina and Thomas were same persons. Therefore, how could Thomas be in 2 different places ? 2- When Manyas went to Thomas's home for the first time, he met with Elina there. At that time, Thomas had been to Manyas's home and met with his wife. Again, how could this be possible?Is there something i was missing? 
tt0368375; CONTAINS SPOILERSJust viewed a copy of this film, and what a ride. Freaky as hell, and an ending that is extremely unnerving. I kinda had a feeling Tomas was the victor, but was still disturbed nonetheless. I though the twist of Tomas/Elina was a nice touch, and an excellent plot twist. Great performances from the cast all around, and tons of suspense that kept me on the edge of my seat. Some nice cinematography , and the scene with Matyas arriving at the home with the bathtub running sent chills down my spine. Lets hope Hollywood does not decide to stick its dirty fingers in this film, and produce a remake. 
tt0368375; I have to agree with one of the previous reviews when they said that this was the best 'twin' special effect that they have ever seen- I honestly thought at first that they were using identical twins. It is dark and dreary, is layered with meaning and brings some really dark questions out in the open.Spoilers In the end I found Matyas to be the victim, the wife's behaviour was appalling and it really makes you think. I agree that it seems unlikely that Thomas could have been in two places at once, but at the same time Elina was played by a woman. So perhaps this belongs in the message board.Otherwise, a great, dark film. 
tt0368375; Please do not mention Hitchcock!The Master knew that without a solid screenplay it's a waste of breath.All those "modern" French thrillers suffer from approximative vague scripts.The directors think that special effects ,disturbing music (here very Chabrolesque),and an ominous soundtrack can make the job done.Spice with uninspired flashbacks and nightmares .Add some sex.Serve tepid.Benoit Magimel is too limited an actor to suggest two different personalities (Jeremy Irons he is definitely not).Even the final trick is not new.It was invented by Sacha Guitry half a century before.And whereas "trouble" takes finally the easy way out ,the 1953 film did not give the audience any answer.Like this?Try these ...."Dead ringers" David Cronenberg 1988 Irons and his twin "Dead ringer" Paul Henreid 1965 Bette Davis and her twin (2)"Toi Le Venin" Robert Hossein 1958 Marina Vlady and Odile Versois "La Vie d'Un HonnAate Homme "Sacha Guitry 1953 Michel Simon and his twin."A stolen life "Curtis Bernardt 1951 Bette Davis and her twin."The dark mirror" Robert Siodmak 1946 Olivia de Havilland and her twin. 
tt0094210; ...Even in death.  This movie is more than anything anyone can tell you about it.  It is not a cop-action movie, not a sociological study, nor an emotional drama.  What you will find yourself watching is what you want to really see.  But what mostly comes through, however the director gets there, is the love lost between a father and a son.  The father having never questioned his love for his son, the son never having thought about his love for his father.  They come together after events in the son's life that could be any other hardship a man goes through in his life.  This time it's prison.So the premice is not that original... So the treatment is a bit artsy.  But the emotions that flare up between the two men are stronger than the story line, and the acting is what makes it all seem so close to home.  The fear of rejection that parents feel when they see their child become an adult, and the feelings of being controlled by their parents, that adults still feel because they haven't grown up yet.A wonderful movie, powerful, simple in it's message but complex in it's meaning.  I would pay anytime to watch it again! 
tt0094210;  The principal attraction of this movie, a family and police drama set in contemporary MontrA©al, was the great play by Gilles Maheu, which has since then become a sucessful theatre director in QuA©bec and around the world. Seeing him ride a motorcycle and fighting against gangsters was very interesting!People shouldn't expect to see a similiar movie from "LA©olo" of the same director, this one proves to be way less artistically refined. 
tt0094210;  In my opinions of course...This film is to be appreciated by those with a bit of insight (or at least a desire to experience different things), an open mind, and sick of same old predictable script hollywood cr*p. If hollywood is your basis for comparison, Un Zoo la Nuit will either enrich your understanding of what movies should be, or show you that you should stick to with hollywood flicks. Not that hollywood doesn't put out good movies. It's just finding that one in a few hundred movies that winds up being a gem.Un Zoo la Nuit is a depiction of deceit, drugs, and dysfunctional human relationships. The father/son relationship is classic, sad. Some scenes are extremely memorable (of course the prison rape scene isn't, but things like that do happen in that real world out there). This movie is not brain dead, it might make you think about your situation and of those around you... The son's emotions of love and compassion come through clearly with his father and you are forced to feel for that relationship. The relationship takes a surrealistic twist when it becomes clear no time is left to catch up. However, the son remains a crook and a murderer.There are no good guys in this movie. Not the stuff of hollywood.What hollywood did to the original versions of Nikita and The Vanishing, just as a couple of examples, should be enough to turn anyone off. When Pacino kills Deniro at the end of Heat, it's just plain wrong!!! :)If you want something that is even more outside the box than Un Zoo la Nuit, check out the recent Maelstom with Croze. Keep an open mind with the fish... But again, a realistic and honest view at real humans.  
tt0094210;  I have read the posted comments on the website and I found they are all from Canada.  It goes to show that many interesting films are never outside the country of their origin.  I came across "Un zoo la nuit" in the suspense section of a local video store and it appeared to haven't been rented in some time.  The cover was beyond deceptive because I saw a woman on it who was screaming and the title "NIGHT ZOO" in bold red caps.  I usually take a chance on watching many different movies and this is one I do recommend on some level and here are my reasons (spoilers herein).(1) Gilles Maheu and Roger Lebel portrayed the father and son in probably the most realistic father-and-son relationship that I have ever played out on screen.  It was shockingly deep considering the negative events surrounding it. (2) Marcel's (played by Gilles Maheu) interaction's with his ex-girlfriend Julie were plotted and written correctly.  I think if that angle had been explored more, it would have stolen very much from the film. (3) When it comes to being realistic, I think this film shatters the good guy-bad guy stereotypes and how they interact.  Marcel is threatened by a rather unsavory pair of cops and one of them cuts him in the face with a switchblade and beats Marcel with a garbage can when Marcel tries to retaliate.  No special effects or explosives needed there. (4) I liked the mixture of English and French speech used in the dialogue.  The dialogue wasn't hokey or forced at all. (5) My favorite scene was the shoot-out between Marcel, his friend from prison, and the two cops.  It wasn't a typical action sequence at all.  (6) There a small scattering of humor throughout the film so it didn't seem so utterly hopeless. (7) The feel of the film to me dealt mostly with loss and I felt the cinematography and musical score backed that aspect rather well. (8) This was a rather stunning debut from Jean-Claude Lauzon.  His writing and direction were (considering the times) definitely out there talentwise and I think that is grounds to for award consideration.  He took home two of his own Genie awards for both writing and direction.  Eight reasons give this film a score of eight.What robs this film of a perfect score is the gross nature of some scenes.  I nearly wanted to gag when Marcel was raped at the beginning.  I guess the material was needed to show how negative this film actually is.  There is no shortage of misery and I call viewers to beware this film if they don't have a strong stomach.  The other reason was the zoo scene where the elephant was shot.  I actually thought that elephant had been killed inside of its cage.  I am not anti-hunting but I don't believe shooting a caged animal is right unless it needs to be euthanized.  If you are an animal lover, shut your eyes when you get to that scene.Overall, I found "Un zoo la nuit" to be a rather watchable film.  It is perfect for a movie fiend looking for something completely different.  Despite a few nasty and misery-laden scenes, it is perfect for anytime viewing.  Here ends my rant! 
tt0094210; Four years were necessary by this film's creative team to raise funding adequate for screening the work, with its setting in Montreal, and its essence as a narrative wayward albeit its production characteristics may well offset its storyline weaknesses for some who will view it by video tape. Winner of a record-setting 13 Genie Awards (Canada's "Oscar" equivalent), the film was the directorial dA©but for Jean-Claude Lauzon, who received a standing ovation at Cannes in 1987 after the picture's showing there, the audience obviously of the belief that there were more than enough artistically positive elements within it to counterbalance its patchwork plot. Lauzon directed but two films prior to his death caused by piloting his airplane into the side of a mountain. He once stated of himself "I always need to be in motion", and this trait, in conjunction with a career background in advertising, probably accounts in part for his maintenance of a frenetic pace for this violence weighted affair. As action begins, Marcel (Gilles Maheu) is being stripped of any dignity that he may have possessed by being forcibly sodomized within his prison cell, and soon after we watch him exit from the prison after completing a two year sentence for some type of narcotics violation. Marcel returns to his apartment that he somehow has managed to retain during his absence and is immediately after visited by a pair of dishonest police detectives who demand $200,000 in cash that he "owes" to them and which he apparently has secreted in too cunning a manner for them to uncover. One of the detectives, George (Lorne Brass) is a homosexual steeped in sadism and it is Marcel's determined efforts to keep the hidden money from the duo while fiercely struggling physically against them that comprise about half of a plot line which also focuses upon the young man's endeavour to repair a severed relationship with his dying father (Roger Le Bel). While Marcel's behaviour upon occasion seems to be vacant of sensate purpose, a viewer will be thankful that his girl friend's appearances in the film are brief, and that the bizarre climactic scenes involving father and son are not lengthier. Some of the film's setups must be deemed as intentionally, in addition to symbolically, grotesque, and there are too many instances when both logic and continuity go begging. Endeavours by a viewer to hearken back to any sort of justification for such episodes will be futile. The earnestly diligent cast members work at creating their roles, with Brass being especially effective as an unprincipled policeman. Dialogue is largely QuA©bA©cois with a sprinkling of English. Subtitles in the latter tongue are for the most part accurate. Although difficulty for viewers to ken a meandering narrative will be a bit of an impediment, the film is not dull. Well past the film's initial release date, the many awards given it for performances by its crew members are completely understandable, as production quality is never less than excellent. However, the general acclaim from Canada and at Cannes might lead one to presume that its competition may have been, at best, somewhat weak. 
tt0094210;  It has its shocking elements, but Un Zoo La Nuit is, in the end, a  touching film about a son trying to re-establish his relationship with his dying father. The zoo surreal zoo scene is particularily touching, in which the father and son, in an attempt to relive their past by going hunting, shoot an elephant with a sleeping dart gun and put him to sleep. Overall, a well-executed and thoughtful movie. 
tt0094210;  I saw this film in a Canadian university film history class(where they made us watch lots of Canadian movies you would never pay to see). The teacher told us that this film proves that Canada can make a Hollywood-style cop-action flick.I can only assume he was joking. This was a convoluted, out-of-touch-with-society mess. It starts out with the main character getting raped by an inmate--then we see him engage in a near pornographic display with a hooker. It becomes  down right hokey near the end when(SPOILER WARNING)the main character's father suffers a heart attack and is being rushed to the hospital and the young man is chasing after it...Then we have the zoo incident. The father and son decide to go moose hunting so they can experience the good ol days. If this was meant to be a tender scene it sure didnt make me sympathetic to them. They cant find a moose in the city so they go to the Zoo--and decide to shoot an elephant instead. The way the elephant "lies down" was pathetic and fake-looking--and I dont see how shooting a caged animal is going to generate any more sympathy from the audience than if they had gone into the forest to shoot a moose--but that's a Canadian film for you. Strange social customs. I'll take a formula Hollywood cop-buddy flick over this any day.  
tt0077538;  "Enter the Fat Dragon" is one of the funniest martial art movies I had the opportunity to see. Sammo Hung portrays a Chinese farm boy that comes to visit a city friend. Just like Tang Lung of "Way of the Dragon." Wherever Sammo goes, trouble starts, therefore he has to rely on his martial art skills to solve the differences. Luckily, Sammo's character learns martial arts by imitating and mimicking his idol, Bruce Lee. He even strokes his nose with his thumb exactly the way Bruce Lee does and also releases his screeching yell. He also uses nunchucks in a scene. It was like watching a fat Bruce Lee. There's a great showdown near the end of the movie which consists of foreign fighters. Sammo has to encounter each opponent one by one. Sort of like "The Game of Death", where each fighter possesses a different martial art discipline from one another.This is one of the films I really enjoyed watching and also the very first Sammo Hung movies I've seen. Excellent fight scenes and a lot of laughs. A rare classic Sammo Hung film I highly recommend for all you martial art fans out there. 8.5/10! 
tt0077538;  This is of of Sammo's great early comedy films. This isn't a parody of enter the dragon, the main character (Sammo) is obsessed with Bruce Lee and emulates him freakishly well for a man of his size. Nominal story about how his fighting keeps causing his loved ones trouble - then fighting. Oh, the fighting. Good, fast-paced scenes with high impact (the white guy who plays a boxer looks like he really gets hurt by one of Sammo's kicks).The funniest bit of this movie was purely unintentional. There is a Jim Kelly looking guy (one of three experts hired to take out Sammo), but he was a Chinese guy in blackface with an afro-wig. Come on, didn't they have any real black people in Hong Kong in 1978? Well, I guess I've seen enough white fake-as-hell "Chinese people" in old American movies too.This is one is for any Sammo or Bruce Lee fan. 
tt0077538;  Sammo Hung directed and stars in this parody of Enter the Dragon. Parody might be a bit strong, it's somewhere between a parody and a tribute to the late great Bruce Lee. You can't take this movie too seriously, but if you go in with the right mindset it's fairly entertaining. There is a lot of comedy thrown in with a few really good kung fu scenes. No surprise that Sammo is good with the jokes, but he definitely has some kung fu skills! He has an uncredited role in the original Enter the Dragon where he fights Bruce Lee.**1/2 (Out of 4) 
tt0077538; The most agile fat guy in martial arts does it again. An early Sammo film that has him imitating his character's hero, Bruce Lee, Sammo is amazingly Lee like in his actions and fighting. The way he slips into Bruce's style and then back to his own, more familiar kung fu is a joy to watch and shows how accomplished and adaptable he is at his art. Throw in a bit of slapstick humour so beloved of this type of flick and this a movie that has it all - comedy (some unintentional, like the fake black guy), action and some incredible fight scenes.A great beer and buddies movie that is worth an hour and a half of anyone's time. 
tt0077538; This movie is not a kung fu movie. This is a comedy about kung fu. And if, before making this film, Sammo Hung hadn't spent some time watching films by the great French comic filmmaker Jaques Tati (i.ie., e.g., esp. Jour de fAate), he is certainly on the same wave length.Personally, I think Tati's films are hilarious, but they're not to all tastes. Some have told me that they loathe his work. I've never figured out why, but I think it's because the character that Tati usually plays himself is so totally dead pan, so unaffected by the events around him (which he is usually causing) that many miss the more subtle comic bits happening around him.At any rate, Tati's main shtick - or at least his best known - is to take a pretentiously upright petite bourgeoisie with 19th century sensibilities and drop him into 20th century France where he must confront a society that is largely defined by the gradual eroding of those sensibilities. He usually has serious difficulties with little things like record players or radios. He's a hazard in a car, but the world's no safer when he rides a bicycle. But through it all, he never loses his aplomb, which is derived from his inner recognition that the nineteenth century was more interesting than the 20th overall.In a similar fashion, the character Sammo Hung himself plays is a country boy come to the big city of Hong Kong, utterly convinced that what makes the city interesting is that Bruce Lee made kung fu movies there. This gets him into trouble in small ways, since he takes in stride happenstance which would never be noticed in a small town but which are deemed inappropriate in a big city - such as the moment when he appears to be urinating in the street, A cop stops him, only to discover that Hung is actually just squeezing water out of his shirt, soaked during an accidental dip in the bay. What's interesting about this gag is why it is Hung doesn't understand what the cop's fuss is all about - in a country town, as long as no one's looking, if you gotta go you gotta go. In other words, Hung is not really urinating in the street - but he certainly would - and what's the problem officer? Of course Hung's obsession with Bruce Lee also gets him into big troubles as well. He beats a gang of thugs who have refused to pay his restaurant-owner uncle. Of course, in a Bruce Lee movie, the thugs would be considered trounced, and they would have learned their lesson. But in Hung's Hong Kong, reality unfortunately prevails, and the thugs return when he's not around, to trounce his uncle.Of course, Hung finally triumphs in the end, just as Tati always did. Characters like this must always triumph (at least in comedy) because they are completely innocent, and as such, despite their comic missteps and misunderstandings, they really represent what is best in the humans we admire and wish to be. We don't really want to be Bruce Lee (who has to experience the loss of all of his friends before he gets a chance to beat the bad-guy), we, in our own innocence, really want a world where Lee's heroics are possible.Unfortunately, that world only exists on film."Ah, but what if...?" - and in that question we find Sammo Hung at his comic best. 
tt0077538; "One of Hung's better early efforts. The humor is dead-on in parts as Hung tries to imitate Lee's moves and facial expressions, and also in a bit where Hung pokes fun at Jackie Chan's Drunken Master. The action is also pretty good, especially when Hung takes on a trio on martial arts experts at the end. It's not the greatest film, but pretty good for '70's kung fu, especially if you're a fan of Hung and/or Lee. Be warned, though: most video versions of the movie have pretty shoddy quality. There is also a character in blackface which some people might find offensive.Sammo Hung is a rural swine-herder who moves to Hong Kong to fight off some bad guys. Sammo turns on his dead-on Bruce Lee impersonation when fighting! This film is often billed as a parody of Bruce Lee's "Enter The Dragon", but it's not exactly that... Sammo is a rural swine herder--obsessed with Bruce Lee--who moves to Hong Kong to help his relatives run a small open-air restaurant. Once situated at the new job, he is forced to defend the eatery from local gangsters looking for protection money. When Sammo switches into fighting mode, he switches on his Bruce Lee impersonation, which must be seen to be believed! This film is pretty sloppy, in many of the fight scenes Sammo battles against people who are obviously actors rather than martial artists, and there's one character who's supposed to be black who is played by an Asian man in heavy (and preposterous) makeup. But what this film lacks in budget and accuracy, it more than makes up for in atmosphere and energy. Highly recommended for a good mood." 
tt0077538;  I saw this film as part of a Hong Kong double bill at a local arthouse cinema and surprisingly it went down pretty well. It has an endearing quality that shines through the confusing, `make it up as we go along plot', bizarrely staged action sequences and unintentionally surreal comedy. In Kung Fu comedy star Sammo Hung's second directorial effort we see him go through a series of barely connected adventures as a fat Bruce Lee fanatic working at his uncle's Hong Kong restaurant. Seemingly meant to be some kind of parody / homage to Bruce Lee's Enter the Dragon, it bares little or no relation to the aforementioned film, with the exception of a fight scene involving a western boxer, a black guy and er .. some other guy. Rather than using a black actor, the film makers decided to black up a Chinese actor for the part. It's hilarious to watch the actor approximating how he thinks a black man might act, as he minces around in some kind of attempted jive swagger! Sammo does quite a good job of imitating Bruce Lee's mannerisms and although this is primarily a comedy, some of the fight sequences are great. It is easy to forget that Sammo is quite an accomplished martial artist when he spends most of his screen time as a big fat bumbling idiot!Overall, there's a great sense of fun running through the film that makes it difficult to dislike, even though it's terrible. If you enjoyed this, check out Sammo Hung in The magnificent Butcher or My Lucky Stars, which are just as ridiculous ridiculous but with more fighting!  
tt0077538; I am a big fan of movies coming from Hong Kong, though I must admit that I go for Hong Kong movies made from the early '80s to the present day - I find Hong Kong films from the '70s to be fairly dull and mostly indistinguishable from each other. But I enjoyed this early Sammo Hung movie. True, there isn't a great plot here - the plot only starts after thirty minutes, and it moves VERY slowly. And I think there will be some viewers who will be offended that a character of African descent is portrayed by an Asian man in an afro wig and blackface. But despite flaws like those, the movie overall is fun. The fights are pretty good, and the movie's sense of humor (mostly in a slapstick vein) is genuinely funny at times. The movie is a good showcase for Hung's fighting and comic skills, and will entertain fans of Hong Kong movies. 
tt0077538;  Overall I would have to say that I liked the movie. Some of the fight scenes are really good. Especially the fight against Leung Ka-Yan. One point that really bothered me was the fact that they used an Asian to play a black man. I mean really. Talk about bad taste. During a fight scene, you see one of the fighters on the floor is laughing. Otherwise, Sammo copies Bruce Lee's fighting moves perfectly. 5 out of 10 Stars. 
tt0349116; Interesting movie, presenting a glimpse into another culture, undergoing massive changes, affecting everyone. Nostalgic, for it presents scenes from our past - cars, home interiors, different appliances. Nostalgic, for the lucky ones among us have been brought up with the aid of a grandma/grandpa - and we miss them a lot now. And of course - Russian - the view, the snow, the music and the people - such a great country, such a powerful life! I enjoyed the film for all possible reasons, it moved and stirred a lot. IMHO - especially for over 30s, for we all remember who helped and loved us in our upbringing years, and feel so lonely without them. It offered me a strange view into so many souls, all so common to our own. 
tt0349116;  This is about Russia of today. A nation there, according to this movie, not only the economy is wicked but the people too. Even towards their old relatives.Nobody wants the Babusya. Everybody thinks about themselves and their comfort. It's not a question of economy, it's just that they don't want the old lady in their homes, even if she digged trenches at Stalingrad, even if she sold her house and gave the money to her grandchildren and even if she is their grandmother.People say things that you realise afterwards is important. "Satan exists" is said as a joke, but it isn't a joke, it's true. Some of the relatives have conscience and cries about their evilness and the fact that there is nothing they can do about it. A very dark film and also a religious one. See it, if you have the oppurtunity.          
tt0349116;  Tolstoy said that happy families were all alike, unhappy families are unhappy in their own distinct way. In this family, grandmother Tosia - who dug ditches at the front in WWII, took care of her daughter's children, and divided the proceeds of the sale of her house to her two sons and daughter - is threatened with homelessness. Regardless of her sacrifices in the past for her extended family, scarcely any of her relatives express willingness to take her in. And the more well-off they are, the more antipathy they seem to possess.Not necessarily a pleasant theme - but one probably existent in all cultures to some extent. 
tt0349116; Many people in the West have a difficult time understanding why Russian's seem to be so indifferent or even supportive of the slow erosion of freedom currently underway under Putin's regime. Some of this is due to the fact that Western media makes Putin's "reforms" seem much worse than they really are. However, much of this misunderstanding in the West is due, in large part, to the West's ignorance of all the troubles the peoples of the former USSR have had to suffer in the 1990's. These troubles have shaken up society so much in Russia, that stability is what matters now, more than anything else.This film does a fairly good job of presenting much of the societal upheaval that took place during the 90's in Russia, by focusing on the relationships of one family that had to live through them. The film portrays traditional Russian (rural) culture and its conflicts with the new. At times the subject matter can be very funny and at other times downright heart breaking.The acting, writing, and direction are all superb. This is one of those movies that I would say is a must see for anyone that is interested in Russian cinema. 
tt0349116;  This is a made-for-HDTV film, and it shows. The cinematography itself is not great either, and the acting and direction are highly uneven (The title role is admirably played by Nina Shubina, but most of the cast is non-professional.) Put that down to the cost of getting the film made at all. Story background -- The film takes place in the Archangelsk region. After raising her family, Tosia raised her daughter Vera's four children while she and her husband were off working on the trains on two-week shifts. The grandchildren are raised, Tosia has sold her house and given them the proceeds, and lives with Vera and her husband. For a tragic reason, she's sent off to her widowed younger sister's, in a village. The sister breaks a hip and her daughter Lysa, a successful TV journalist, tries to put Granny (Babusya) up with her cousins (Tosia's grandchildren). She essentially fails. The object of the film, however, is not this story which, as others have noted, in one form or another is an ageless classic. Rather, it is the contrast between what may be called "old Russians", still centered on their village (mostly women and mostly old), and what the film calls "new Russians", the younger generation busy making it in the city, and which in ten or fifteen years has managed to perfectly learn to look out for numero uno. (Or perfectly unlearn humanity, as one "old Russian", Oleg (?), puts it to a new Russian.) The hardest blows aimed at Granny occur in her absence, addressed to Lysa, who in a sense stands for the audience. Lysa explains to Oleg that "the new Russians are the masters of *that* world". Oleg answers, "Are you sure you're part of *this* world, then?"The "old Russians'" daily life is carefully depicted. The film will interest those who are attracted by this depiction, and only then by the contrast with the "new Russian" class.  
tt0349116; because it is a touching picture of Russia because it is a good support to understand the East Europe. because the performance of Nina Shubina is admirable. a not complicated story. nothing spectacular. not judgment or verdicts. only testimony about an old woman and the relations with her relatives. and it is enough. a film with old special flavor. almost a fairy tale who reminds the solid walls who defines our lives. a film about love, miracle and forgiveness, sacrifice and wise choice. and an amazing character who gives answer to blindness of the other grace to her huge dedication and manner to discover life sense. must see it only for rediscover science of profound simplicity to be heart of existence. 
tt0349116;  I say "Babusya" at the International Film Festival of Rotterdam. It's quite an entertaining movie, but the story takes too long to be told. The acting is good, as is the Russian scenery. The direction is quite good.The story of the film is its biggest flaw. It's nothing more than showing different relatives of "Granny", and how they all refuse to take her in. The movie is only 90 minutes long, but it seems so much longer because of this boring storyline. 
tt0107877;  Pay television has the best late night films an insomniac could want. Prison Heat has all the elements of the other _ _ _ _ _ heat films, you have a little T and A, a shower scene, an imposing lesbian who rules the cell block, a trip to solitary confinement, a male/female warden who desires one or all of the new chicks, and a rape scene, usually by one of the aforementioned parties.This one was surprisingly amusing. The acting was ... dare I say it, decent, on some level. If you've seen one of these babes behind bars movies, however, you've seen them all, and the only true change in store is a different set of bodies.I found a little of their situations a bit too unbelievable, especially some of the things Colleen had learned at her vet, had seen at her.....you get the idea. This one actually tried to stick with the story line more than others. I said story line, not plot, the movie isn't that deep. The T and A was minimal, and I didn't really miss it. As far as this genre goes, this is one of the better movies, but it's no Citizen Kane and still  not as enjoyable as Reform School Girls. 5 out of 10 
tt0107877;  With a climax escape scene rivaling the frightfully awful belly laughs of Plan 9 From Outer Space, Prison Heat boasts a bevy of bimbos behind bars enduring a host of midnight male abuse from the usual suspects.If one isn't careful to pay close attention to what would seem was just another excuse to drop drawers in the wee B-hours, one could miss the genius behind this stupendous assault on cinema.Clad in mini-skirts and body stockings for their stretch in a Turkish cooler, a quartet of framed females sidestep lesbian lovers and Curly Joe prison guards with an arsenal of lame escape tactics that would put the Lucy Show to shame in the just-crazy-enough-to-work department.The four foxy heroes play it painfully straight in contrast to their cartoonish stereotype-on-steroids foes.(As Prison Heat can be enjoyed many times over for connoisseurs of bad film, those who have yet to see the film might not want to read the following as some key elements are revealed.)The whimsical writing flip flops the characters from 'fraidy cats to vicious vixens without missing a beat of nutcase rhythm. At first, the girls seem skittish to actually hurt anybody. Rather than shooting anyone with their purloined pistol, they dump sleeping pills down the gurgling gullets of guards and others in their way.But the kid gloves come way off when they whittle down the sadistic warden by conking his cranium with everything from crash cymbals to the kitchen sink -- before castrating him with a penknife (!) and making a run for an unattended rental car.And what prison escape epic would be complete without breaking into a melancholy sing along of `Oh Susannah?'The quirky, weird-o-rama dynamics of Prison Heat are guaranteed fun for lovers of scatterbrained B-hits.  
tt0107877;  If you loved the classic "Caged Heat", you'll like this one. The plot is silly. The acting is lame. The believability factor is almost zero. But it does have some beautiful women wearing next to nothing (during the few moments when they're not wearing absolutely nothing), not to mention the obligatory lesbian scenes. The killing is at a minimum (How many sleeping pills did they find, anyway? It must've been a full case.) and the T&A is at a maximum. If you like movies that make social and political commentary, skip this one, but if you just want to waste 91 minutes looking at beautiful female bodies, this is the movie for you! 
tt0107877;  I have to admit that this is what I would call a guilty pleasure. The acting is poor, the plot predictable and the story leaves little to the imagination. However, if you like women's prison flicks then check this out. Basically 4 American babes get framed for drug possession and thrown in to a Turkish prison. Here they meet up with cruel lesbians and a sadistic warden. Lori Jo Hendrix plays the "innocent" of the four. She is repeatedly raped by the creepy warden and shows plenty of skin. Rebecca Chambers has a good lesbo shower scene and of course they are all eager to show skin at one time or another. The ending is not hard to figure out but Lori Jo Hendrix makes this show worth watching just to check out her hot bod. The one scene where she gets raped doggy style by the warden on his desk is fairly memorable. 
tt0107877;  This is a standard prison chick flick that after I saw it, I had to rush to Ebay to pick it up....cheap.  Yeah, I wouldn't spend alot of money on this one in getting an uncut version cuz it's really not that good.  Lori Jo Hendrix posed some for Playboy and she's got one helluva body on her.  She makes the flick by herself.  Her character gets singled out by the prison warden and the cell block tough lesbian because she is such looker.  She gets raped and ravaged by both and you the viewer get to see all the goods.  Lori has them and you won't be disappointed by her.  Oh, were there really other chicks in this movie?  None of the others really did anything for me and other than Lori's nude and sex scenes, this movie sucked! 
tt0107877; (small spoilers about the characters and the troubles they get into. Fussy people should see the flick first.) If you are a politically correct person who would be upset by scenes of naked women or stereotypically nasty portrayals of followers of Mohammed doing nasty things to above mentioned women, please skip this movie. But if you like WIP movies, this movie has all the requisite elements of such movies combined with great greaser villains and nice Turkish background music, plus an awesome lesbo queen bee. Playboy model Lori Jo Hendrix is cast as the big tit bimbo who "protects" herself by wearing a babydoll nightgown, and Rebecca Chambers is cast as the brunette brain (following the Charlie's Angels Theory of Hair Color and Intelligence) who plots the escape, and fights with the evil queen bee in the shower.Today WIP pictures seem to require a serious social drama plot to make them PC, they don't make 'em like this any more, and I wish they did! 
tt0107877;  Sure it's not a great drama,but is this the reason you wanted to see it? Four young females (College Coeds) are on a vacation close to the border of Turkey when they are falsely arrested by guards and the next thing the girls know is that they are undressing before an oily prison director and his guards. Lori Jo Hendrix, blond and bosomy is the main reason for the strip search and we see Lori in a number of scenes where she is in her Birthday suit or partially clad: the shower scenes, the one where the lesbian gang leader has her way with Lori and a few more where the prison director rapes Lori.  The scenes that were not very believable are mainly where Lori submits to the female gang leader who uses just one hand to hold her down.The film is most effective in showing Lori Jo reacting to the sexual advances of the prison director in the early strip search  as her clothing is removed and her ample breasts and firm bottom are revealed and later on as she submits to his control of her body as she tries to protect her friends. 
tt0107877;  Plenty of T & A, shower scenes, and full breasts straining against flimsy cotton blouses in this beyond-belief exploitation film.  Four gorgeous American babes are wrongly jailed in a Turkish prison, where they face the expected sexual threats from cruel jailers, lesbo-inmates, and the inevitable warden-rapist.  Perhaps the best reason to see this film is for the wardrobe:  all four of the curvaceous cuties wiggle around the prison in Daisy Mae Dogpatch-style butt-twitcher cutoffs and oh-so-tight, braless tops.If you really have 90 minutes with nothing else to do, you might watch this Israeli curiosity, be warned, however, that the reason for its existence will mystify you.   
tt0107877; The first time I saw Prison Heat, it was on Cinemax back in 1997. It originally came out in 1993 along with "Chained Heat" and "Chained Heat 2" (there must have been some sort of fetish about women in prison?).Anyway, "Prison Heat" is about some young women travelling across foreign boarders near turkey who are framed for drug possession and put in one of these foreign prisons. Unknown to them is the fact that the prisons are flesh traders and selling hot young women into sex slavery/harems/etc.The story follows Rebecca Chambers and Lori Joe Hendrix's characters closest. Rebecca is the tough, more mature woman while poor little Lori Joe with her massive breasts, small waste and girlish - innocence becomes the target of the Prison Warden Saladin. Saladin starts by giving her the eye and then proceeds to molest her (in one of the most erotic sexual assault scenes I've seen on film).This type of film must fall into some sort of rape fetish category because in addition to Saladin, little Lori Joe is targeted by prison lesbians too.Once the girls figure out that they are about to be trafficked, they must hatch an elaborate plot to escape the prison.The story isn't bad actually and the film is watchable. If you like this type of film, its an *instant classic* but many of you, understandably will not be interested or sexually aroused by a rape fetish flick. 
tt0107877; This movie has made an indelible mark on my memory - probably from the pouch on the warden's desk supposedly made from part of an inmate. Eeew.With items like that, the titillation (absolutely no pun intended) is moderated by some really creepy moments and pathos. On the upside, the protagonists are cute, with a little something for all male tastes, there's a tough one, a seriously pneumatic one, etc.There are moments though- I still laugh when I remember one line from the scary warden, threatening the girls with a "painful, unremitting death."Isn't all death unremitting? 
tt0107134; Iranian movies came to my life in the early 90's. Very frequently, they surprise me, just like this one.When the entire world wants movies to be sexed up by more sex, violence and kinky scenes, I greatly appreciate the Iranian film makers that they produce outstanding movies with children and ordinary people in this supposedly closed Islamic country. This brings along a new breath into the world movie scene.The themes of actors' identity on screen and off screen, acting or living (autobiographical) in the camera are both most studied in Iranian movies.Akbar (played by Akbar Abdi) is a accomplished Chaplin-like comedian wishing to do serious and challenging art movies but circumstances just prevent that from being materialized. His seemingly barren wife, Simin is so anxious to give him a child to an extent that she seems to be pretty mad and eccentric in many bizarre ways. To cut the Gordian Knot, she arranges for him to marry a dumb-deaf gypsy girl. In between, bunches of crazy and funny moves. Yet, when he decides to get rid of commercial films once and for all, his own wife is pregnant, which may alter his plans.The ending impresses me the most: Akbar wants the gypsy girl to leave because his wife is expecting now, she is a "surplus". The girl reclaims her all her "insanity" and opens her mouth to seriously tell the truth that her acting is for making a living, she has been acting all the time. Who would disagree that she is the best leading actress in the show? 
tt0120372; Kira Muratova is one of my favorite directors. She combines in her movies such an unusual and interesting blend of feminine subtlety and masculine hardness and power. This movie is a perfect evidence of it. The movie consists of three unrelated stories, which, as I see it, reflect the director's view on dark sides of various demographic parts of contemporary society. The first story is by far the best on my opinion. Though this part of the movie can be easily regarded as misandric, I especially love it for absolutely excellent and sparkling playing of actors.Definitely recommend all to see this movie. 
tt0120372;  I love Kira Muratova. This movie's said to be cruel and empty, but it's a masterpiece. What is "Three Stories"? The three stories. Murder stories. It's about how we become aliens to each other, how we don't care, don't see and don't hear each other. Alienation - the main theme of the movie. And it grows more in scale from story to story. First - friends, neighbors, just ordinary people. Second - mother and daughter. Third - generations conflict. And in the third story (Muratova is a co-writer) alienation achieves the extreme degree - old, handicapped, intelligent man and little, healthy, ordinary girl. The key to the whole movie is a scene between two old women - mother and daughter - in the second story. The only people in the film who REALLY WANT to hear, DO care, but they just CANNOT reach one another. Muratova's directing, Tabakov and Makovetzkiy's acting and cinematography (forgot the guy's name) - surely the best of recent Russian movies.My rating is 100 of 10!PS. Watch undubbed!  
tt0134854; Everyone knows Robin Hood, but not many has parodied him so well as Pasanen has done. Finnish movie-wizard Pasanen created a medieval world into late 1960's Finland and made a movie that is really fun to watch, though not all jokes give you another laugh after viewing this item about twentieth time. Despite this there are still some really good ones, that make you laugh every time you watch the film. The preface in the film makes a parody of Finnish literature and history so well that you can't but admit Pasanen's genius! Great is also the music. The 'almost' a title song is sang by Danny, who plays a minstrel in the movie. As this movie is a comedy, not everything need to be from medieval age. You may forgive Pasanen for dragging Leonardo da Vinci from the Renaissance to somewhat earlier time. Some of the jokes are a bit contemporary and are difficult to comprehend as they were meant to be, but who cares. With 'Noin 7 VeljestA¤' Spede created a movie that is a complete entertainment with all necessary item: drama, action, music, jokes, strange machines, hot women and funny faces. 
tt0134854;  Noin 7 veljestA¤ shows us a various group of funny men in medieval surroundings.Juhani Kumpulainen is Linnanherra von Wurtzburg, Spede Pasanen is in a double role as Sir Wilhelm and Robin Hood, Simo Salminen is Mauno Munalukko, Leo Jokela is SeppA¤ Leonardo, Helge Herala is Rautahanska, Vesa-Matti Loiri is Huovi, Ere Kokkonen is PitkA¤-Jussi, Jukka Virtanen is Veli Tuck, Olavi Ahonen is Pappi, Veikko Sinisalo as Takku and the legendary singer Danny is the troubadour.Then there are the beautiful women Pirkko KankaanpA¤A¤ as Venla, Kaisu Vuoristo as Helena and Krista Sihvo as Leonardo's wife.This movie was directed by Jukka Virtanen in 1968 and Ere Kokkonen and Spede Pasanen wrote it.The late Jaakko Salo made the music to it.Spede movies were funniest among all Finnish movies.This isn't an exception.I found myself laughing at loud many times.And so did my whole family.Spede movies are great fun for the whole family.I have watched these movies with my family since I was a kid so I was very sad when I heard three years ago that Spede Pasanen has died.He was a great comedian.Sort of like Finnish Jerry Lewis.I could say Finnish comedy movies were funnier in general in the old days than they are now.Just take a look at this movie.I mean, when you see Spede singing his hilarious song, you can't do nothing but laugh.  
tt0070795; Perhaps because I was so young, innocent and BRAINWASHED when I saw it, this movie was the cause of many sleepless nights for me. I haven't seen it since I was in seventh grade at a Presbyterian school, so I am not sure what effect it would have on me now. However, I will say that it left an impression on me... and most of my friends. It did serve its purpose, at least until we were old enough and knowledgeable enough to analyze and create our own opinions. I was particularly terrified of what the newly-converted post-rapture Christians had to endure when not receiving the mark of the beast. I don't want to spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it so I will not mention details of the scenes, but I can still picture them in my head... and it's been 19 years. 
tt0070795;  I saw this film so long ago I can't recall how old I was--had to have been less than 8 years old but older than 4. After watching it with my parents, it haunted me for the longest time, particularly when connected with the song "Wish We'd All Been Ready". Made in 1972 and having a low-budget feel to it, the acting was terrible and effects were poor, but the message was strong and persuading. The intent was obviously to scare the viewer into salvation. However, depending on your mindset while watching A Thief in the Night, you may or may not take any of it seriously. That is why as a child, lacking the experience, understanding, and ability to compartmentalize it was the most disturbing...for me anyway.  
tt0070795; I was raised in a "very Christian" household since birth. I was saved before I saw this movie and the rest of the series and was forced to watch it in a youth group at my church. This movie was highly disturbing. I saw it when I was about 12 years old and literally had nightmares about it for years. I used to lay awake in bed and listen for the sounds of my mom's footsteps upstairs. If I didn't hear her footsteps, I would sneak upstairs to make sure she hadn't been raptured. I used to pray so hard every night for salvation because I was terrified of Jesus forgetting me. This is definitely not something I will show to my kids until they are much older, if at all. It took me years to shake the fear that this movie gave me. 
tt0070795; Long before Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins would shake the world of the Christian subculture (and make millions in the process) with the LEFT BEHIND books, MARK IV Pictures, the Christian film distribution company of the Billy Graham evangelistic association, gave us this masterwork. What I love most about this genre is its incredible attention to detail, sitting in a living room. Instead of taking us to the dramatic scenes of this "post-rapture" tribulation, we sit in the living room, hearing about it on the news because the filmmakers can't afford to show it. The film's premise is grounded in Pre-Millenial, pre-Tribulation eschatalogy, believing that Christ comes once for the secret taking of the true church, and then comes again at the end of the seven years of hell on earth. What used to terrify me in junior high now makes me laugh. The intriguing adventures of Patty and her journey throughout the tribulation (and two of the film's three sequels) tells her remarkable story of unbelief and ultimately damnation. I hate to admit it, but I still thoroughly enjoy watching this. It even has the SAME EXACT score of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I think I'm the only person in history to make that observation. 
tt0070795; I saw this movie twice through a pentecostal church my family attended in Nanaimo BC in the 1970's. I was of the tender age of 6, my brother 4, then again when I was 8 my brother 6. This movie terrified my brother and I and shaped how we viewed the world with distrust. It wasn't just the movie, but it was also the philosophy that engulfs so many "christians" about the "mark of the beast"and the rapture. This movie, the church, and a volatile neglectful upbringing, lead to severe paranoia towards the future. For years, I lived under the delusional affects of the church and fear of being forgotten by Christ. I am now 40 years old. Went through years of counseling. I once explained to a psychiatrist this movie and the belief system of the church and family. I was pegged with a delusional disorder. I actually began to believe this, it was my brother who reminded me, that this cultic philosophy actually happened. I no longer fear the future, I have come to terms with the fear injected into it's members by the church. I have taken this experience to fulfill a purpose, I am nearing my licensure as a Psychologist specializing in childhood trauma. 
tt0070795;  SPOILERS AHEAD! I saw this film at the urging of the girl who works at the videostore, who described it as "Total MST3K." And how right she is. Granted, the film has a regional interest for me, as it was filmed in my hometown of Des Moines, Iowa. Basically, this is Left Behind from the early '70s, and it goes to show that the evangelicals have been pumping out religious propoganda aimed at scaring non-believers through the art of film for over thirty years now. The music is also right on, from the hit "You've Been Left Behind" (later covered in a decent version--something i can say even though i'm not a fan of Christian rock) to the thematic drum 'n' trumpet music reminiscent of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Also, the clothes and hairstyles are the best, Linklater surely stole the look of the character Jerry in this film for Dazed and Confused. As for story, well, the rapture comes and millions of Christians simply disappear--non-believers are left behind and life goes on as usual (except for the bit about the UN making a single global government called Unite, which uses the mark of the beast--your choice of back of the hand or on the forehead--for commerce and labeling of citizenship).  Honestly, everything seems fine, except for the easily swayed citizens of the world who willingly accept one government, oh, and the underground new Christians, who are freaking out nonstop. Stuff gets crazier and crazier and the heroine--who I've failed to mention--thinks her old friends are trying to kill her.  And then, yup, turns out it was all a dream.  Granted, after she wakes up, we have a deja vu moment where her husband's electric shaver is in the sink--just like the beginning of the dream!  But who's to say he didn't step out for a smoke?  Eh...  Whattaya expect from Russell Doughten (who appears as the grandfatherly preacher who misled his flock), the man who produced 1958's smash hit horror film starring Steve McQueen: The Blob!  And thankfully for us, this wonderful golden nugget of gold was followed by A Distant Thunder, where we discover her husband really did disappear in the rapture...  (by the way, the whole series of 4 films has been released on DVD with loads of cool extras!) 
tt0070795; I discovered this "End Times" movie on Google Video when I typed in "1972". It's basically the story of Patty and how she gets left behind with other non-believers after the believers (which included her snake-bitten husband) were perished. I liked the opening song in the beginning credits and some of the chase scenes. I'm just not sure the movie was a good lesson on the benefits of devotion to the teachings of the Bible since it gives us the fear but not the joy of the exercise. And then there's that cheesy montage of domestic life of Patty and her husband that screams '70s. This film is very much of its time. However, it is pretty effective as a story and it does make you think about the filmmaker's intentions. So see A Thief in the Night with an open mind and don't think too much about the uneven acting or writing but about how effective the movie's message is. 
tt0070795; I watched this movie when I was 9 years old. Unlike other people I seem to be the one that loved this movie when i watched it. I do not believe this is as some say a scare tactic. I believe it is a warning, a chance to make your life right, to be prepared. I have watched the entire series and still to this day continue to watch it whenever i get the chance. People who loved this movie would also love the Left Behind Series. God loves all of you and he does not want you to have to go through the horrible things that will happen after the rapture. This movie talks of salvation and it explains the consequences of deciding against God. If you where scared.... then you knew in your heart that you where not saved. This is more then just a movie, it is God calling people to him before it is to late. 
tt0070795; All these reviews I've read so far are from kids that got scarred for life or from anti-Christian views. Now first of I was one of those kids "forced" to watch this movie, though I never felt forced. I attended a Christian school and the whole school watched it together. Did this movie scare me? Hell yes I was about 6 or 7 when I watched this.. This movie is based on the book Revelations from the bible. It's basis starts that a pre-tribulation rapture occurs (if you are unfamiliar with that it basically means that the Christian people of the world will be taken from the earth before the start of the 7 years of tribulation). I would never recommend that you sit a child down to watch this movie, I don't really know what it is about it the visuals or the haunting feel, but it will scare just about any kid, especially if they come from a background of knowledge of the "End Times". The movie itself is done in a 70's theme, bell-bottoms and the whole bit. The acting is pretty bad. Though if you want to learn a little about what Christians think will happen in the not so distant future watch it. For those people saying this is a scare tactic movie for the Christian movement, I would say yes and no. In the movie if you accept Christ as your savior before the rapture, you are spared living through the 7 years of tribulation, but on the other hand, if you accept Christ after the tribulation you will be hunted down and killed. It was meant as a Christian movie. I believe those that don't have some knowledge of the Christian faith or have it themselves will just dog this movie because it is from that view. Though I'm not saying this is a great movie by any means, but it definitely was an interesting view especially when I watched it again as an adult. 
tt0070795; As some other comments show, this movie might scare you, when you're a little child. (And that is probably all that it is good for.)However, if you're older, this movie only does one thing: suck majorly -and thereby I don't mean the acting, its soundtrack, cutting or s.th. like that. I'm simply talking about the "plot" (if you can call it that). SPOILERS ahead ------------------------I don't want to give any more spoilers than necessary (if after reading this, you really still want to watch this movie) but if you graduated from any school, this is just a big insult of your intelligence. When watching this, I was stunned most of the time, because what was happening was just THAT stupid.This includes:-the forming of UNITE (an evil UN-association) --> we are just supposed to believe it's evil. is it even evil at all? if so: why is it evil?-the mark of evil in the form of a tattoo --> there is no necessity to impose this on the people, so why the hell (no pun intended) are they doing it? -inviting Christ to your heart merely as lip service -->because there's nothing anybody, who in this movie is considered "a real Christian", ever does, besides saying that stupid prayer. so...just say that prayer before the rapture and you're saved - no matter what?! Thus, rating 1/10 
tt0822856; Ordering/renting TLA Video Releasing products is a hit-and-miss affair at best, unfortunately marked by a whole lot more "misses". The gay and lesbian independent film movement is still finding its feet yet, it is still pretty difficult to sift through all the coming out/coming-of-age/romance-against-all-odds stories and find something that seems fresh and original. I have seen a few standouts, like ANOTHER GAY MOVIE, EATING OUT, the surprisingly moving BOY CULTURE, and the slasher-film-with-a-gay-twist HELLBENT. SOCKET, in spite of flaws that come mostly from its VERY low budget origins, can still be added to the list. Writer/director Sean Abley, who is a self-admitted fan of David Cronenberg's films, may have aimed a little too high with this semi-homage to the director, but one can't blame him for giving it a good try, or for coming up with something that's more watchable than your "average gay movie" about drugs, dancing, casual sex and all the melodrama that comes with it.Dr. Bill Matthews (Derek Long) awakens in the hospital one day with no memory of the event that put him there, until it's explained to him that he was struck by lightning. A very attentive intern named Craig Murphy (gay indie staple Matthew Montgomery from GONE, BUT NOT FORGOTTEN and LONG TERM RELATIONSHIP), also the victim of a lightning strike, warns Bill that life for him will never be the same, and hands him a business card with a phone number to contact a "special group" of other people who will be able to "help him when he's ready." Baffled but curious, Bill takes the card.Later, convalescing at home with the help of lesbian buddies Carol (Rasool J'Han) and Olivia (Allie Rivenbark), Bill discovers that his ordeal has left him with some very curious side effects, not the least of which are the compulsion to clean and organize his house meticulously (amazing for the formerly sloppy singelton) and a strange attraction to his TV set, even when it's not showing anything but static and snow, (shades of James Woods in VIDEODROME!) Eventually, all this weirdness finally does lead Bill to contact the group and reconnect with Murphy, leading to a remarkable discovery: an underground group of lightning strike victims who not only survived, but have developed a craving for electricity and the temporary "high" it brings them. Reluctant at first, once Bill's had his first taste of "juice" since his accident, he develops both an addiction to it and to Murphy, whom he engages in a torrid affair. As the story progresses, Bill's addiction grows stronger and he becomes more desperate to find ways to feed it, just like any crack head or heroin junkie, leading him to commit some horrifying acts - the kind you see in most sci-fi/horror thrillers where the hero suddenly loses control of himself to external and/or internal forces . I guess I don't have to tell you that the story doesn't exactly have a happy ending.And actually, that's one of SOCKET'S biggest drawbacks - that it doesn't really have an ending. Where VIDEODROME, the movie that this most closely resembles, had kind of an ambiguous ending that left the audience to decide for themselves what actually happened, SOCKET just kind of...comes to a halt. It's almost as if Sean Abley had a much more elaborate ending written, but because of time and budget constraints, just sort of "winged it" with what he could come up with.Which is too bad, because unlike a lot of gay indies that are barely watchable, this one has its very strong points. And, of course, that list starts with the leads. Long and Montgomery have great chemistry as the "charged-up" lovers, plus it's refreshing to have two actors so easy on the eyes engaged in some great love scenes that are neither as gratuitous or as forced as they have been in other movies. J'Han and Rivenbark also shine as the gal pals, though Rivenbark could've dialed the butch Olivia's character back just a tad. As Bill's stoic colleague, Alexandra Billings does a good job playing Dr. Emily Andersen, and though it could've turned out to be a bit much, Sean Abley hits just the right notes as the leader/moderator of the "group." David Kittredge's editing seems jumbled and very disorienting at first, until you 'get' the gist of it about a third of the way through the movie. In hindsight, he and Abley made some very ingeniously creative choices, minimizing the need for special visual effects and setting the tone for the story. The effects makeup by Gage Hubbard is surprisingly effective for the kind of thing you'd get if you tried to achieve "VIDEODROME"- level ambitiousness on a "BLAIR WITCH PROJECT" budget.There aren't nearly enough writers and directors in this particular niche of indie film-making, who are willing to go out on a limb and take some real risks with style and storytelling. With a little more time and money and opportunities to tweak the script a bit more, SOCKET could have definitely been closer to a ten-star worthy effort. As is, though, the aspects of the film that succeed far outweigh the ones where it doesn't. I would hope that future circumstances will bring director Abley together again with the engaging leads, with a project that will enable them to raise all of their talents to the next level. 
tt0822856; If your expectations are so low that nudity in a non-adult film is sufficient to get you to watch a movie, particularly given how easy it is to find nudity and near nudity on line without going to an adult site, then this is probably the movie for you. If you expect good technical production values, an excellent and plausible story, good direction and acting, then you want to avoid this film. It does feature a unique element in the plot - at least for a gay theme indie film, and the director did do a little more with the low budget than some other films out in the past five years have accomplished. However, this is another case where a first time director, working from his own plot, is felled (and his projects fails miserably) because there is no director to call the writer on the weakness of his plot, or no writer to argue with the director about where the move is being moved or pushed away from the script -- or simply to toss ideas around with.The performances aren't horrible, but the two leads are not as charismatic, particularly Montgomery, to get the plot from point A to point B as per the story, and the movie finally fails on the weakness in the plot, particularly towards the end of the film. 
tt0822856; Sean Abley's film "Socket" fails in every respect, the story is flat, pointless, and uninteresting, the acting is remarkably unprofessional, the cinematography reflects a frightening absence of creativity (or even competence), and the director reveals that he has no eye for screen presentation. One wonders how it's possible to expend the time, money, and effort required to create a film, and to then turn an apparently blind eye to the final product. The movie is presented as a gay horror film, so we're treated to pointless sex-oriented nudity, which delivers no heat whatsoever. Indeed, one wonders whether director Abley was more concerned about the film's gay/nudity aspect than its horror aspect. Either way, none of it delivers. These characters give gay people a bad name: boring. The DVD offers a "special feature" section wherein the cast and crew discuss the making of the film. It is pathetic to listen to these people discuss their effort as though they had created something worthwhile. Sorry, this film is terrible. 
tt0822856; Are you gay (or just curious)? Do you like David Cronenberg? Are you especially fond of his movies "Videodrome" and "Crash"? Do you like looking at naked men? If you answered yes to all of those questions, then "Socket" is meant for you, but you stand a better chance of enjoying it if you only want to look at naked men.That's not to say that nudity is all "Socket" has going for it. This story about Bill Matthews (Derek Long), a surgeon who survives a lightning strike only to discover he gets an erotic charge from electricity, is a fairly promising Cronenberg homage/rip-off, the weird sexiness almost drowning out the story's overarching silliness (which is more than could be said for Cronenberg's "Crash"). Matthew ("Pornography: A Thriller") Montgomery is well cast as Craig, the hospital intern who introduces Bill to a cult of electro-fetishists, becoming the doctor's Energizer love bunny in the process. Not only does Montgomery deliver one of the movie's stronger performances, he and Long actually look like a believable couple, the two men attractive without being unattainable hunks. Also, they look pretty good naked, which they prove early and often.But "Socket" also has a lot going against it. While Long looks good in the buff, his performance isn't as captivating, his acting style leading me to wonder if he was a porn star trying for legitimacy (he isn't). At least he's better than Allie Rivenbark as Olivia, one of the doctor's lesbian friends. Crass lesbian friends have emerged as a gay movie staple, second only to gold-hearted drag queens, but Rivenbark's Olivia is just obnoxious, barking her sarcastic lines like an angry pit bull. When she berates Bill for not calling I had hoped his response would be, "I'm sorry, I meant to call but then I remembered I don't like you" (but it isn't). Maybe the doctor would've been better off with some drag queen pals.Ultimately, "Socket" is brought down by ideas that aren't fully realized in the script and can't be realized with the minuscule budget. Snowy TVs are omnipresent throughout the movie, but their significance is never explained. Does Bill's mere presence affect TV reception? Does he, as suggested by a few "Videodrome"-like scenes, get off on a static-filled TV screen? Did he forget to pay his cable bill? Even loudmouth Olivia doesn't remark on the snowy TV in Bill's living room, as if it's merely an art installation common in L.A. households. Writer-director Sean Abley finds some creative ways to stretch a dollar, but by the fourth rapid-cut, seizure-inducing montage Â<U+0096> used to illustrate characters dosing on electricity Â<U+0096> I was wishing Abley had rustled up some additional funds for F/X before going into production. But I kind of enjoyed this attempt at a gay-themed erotic horror movie, despite its underdeveloped script, lackluster performances and bargain-basement production values. Bad as it is, I've seen much worse, and I applaud any gay filmmaker who tries something other than the usual coming out stories and campy romantic comedies. Also, did I mention Long and Montgomery look good naked? 
tt0822856; Wow - some reviews have been rather harsh, don't you think? Here are my thoughts on this movie without giving too much away. It had an interesting premise that I haven't seen before. It moved along at a nice clip and never left me bored. The actors were handsome and it had enough nudity to be "fun" without being tacky. It was an enjoyable way to spend part of an evening and it is a movie I would watch again.Yes - there are times in the movie where the smallish budget is evident - but it didn't really take me out of the movie. Yes - some of the actors might have been a little stiff, but once again, didn't take me out of the flick.So often, people complain about the "gay stereotypes" in these movies. Guess what folks. "Stereotypical" gay people exist. Just because they aren't as "straight acting," "hipster," or "edgy" as you are does not make them less relevant.Kudos to the director, staff and everyone else involved for making something interesting and fun. 
tt0822856; I don't mind all the male nudity in this movie, the only thing I mind is female nudity (don't ask me why, I just don't like it) (Thankfully there is none in this movie), so if you can get past all the male nudity and stuff that is similar, then you might like this movie.There is a really neat plot, about people that are addicted to electricity, and each time someone electrifies themselves on purpose (of course) then I felt a rush throughout my body (who else felt like that?). This happened a few times throughout the movie, and when they put actual plugs into their hands, this feeling intensified a bit.The thing I don't get is, "why him?" a guy that just joined already making huge changes to the organization? That part I don't get. It doesn't seem right to let a newbie create something that could change the whole organization, but...After about an hour (maybe) the movie starts getting boring. All you see is stuff you've already seen before: electrifying themselves, the two gay characters "hooking up" in explicit detail (kind of) that you've seen before, nothing new. Got a little too repetitive to me. 
tt0822856; First let's note that this is not a common genre in the gay themed films. I think it is a bold attempt and all involved should be commended. The basic plot is a young doctor is struck by electricity and recovers in the hospital, only to find out that he is not alone in this experience. He is invited to join a group of other survivors and then the "fun" begins. Socket tackles addiction on a whole new level.With that in place let's discuss the performances. The two female actresses bring a sense of comedy to the movie and are well cast in the roles they perform. The cast that form the circle of the non-typical support group are well played in a spooky addictive way. Which leaves us with the two main actors, Derek Long and Matthew Montgomery.Derek Long gives us a quality performance as the doctor on the brink of addiction. His development goes from the laid back doctor with flirtatious intentions towards Murphy to the heightened psychopath consumed by his addictions. Matthew Montgomery does well, as always in slowly letting his character develop in front of you. In this case going from a caring intern, to a taste of the dark side of electrocution addiction, and begins to really care about Dr. Matthews. It is Murphy's seduction that takes us on the journey that will eventually lead them to the destruction of the addiction, and Matthew Montgomery handles that journey and seduction masterfully.This is not an easy genre to step in and out of and I think it was for the most part a good effort. 
tt0822856; I give it two stars for frontal nudity and the rest is garbage the movie stinks so bad I had to fast forward to bear it...as a gay man I always hope for a fine well done movie and unfortunately this just wasn't any of those things. Convoluted, stupid, boring, utterly a waste of time. Montgomery I have seen him in other films he just can't act, the other actor was decent but the movie just isn't any good terrible direction, awful script just skip it, there are better gay films out there to bad most of them are foreign made or else come from a non gay filmmaker. I guess it was a big stretch to try and make a meaningful movie and have it be sci-fi horror. 
tt0822856; Dr. Bill Matthews (Derek Long) is hit by lightning. He survives and intern Craig Murphy (Matthew Montgomery) gets him to join a group of people who were also struck by lightning. They all felt terrible--till they find that a jolt of electricity weekly makes them feel great. Bill and Craig fall in love and everything is fine...but Bill craves more and more electricity and becomes addicted.It sounds silly and it was for a while. But the good acting and directing kept me in my seat and (as it went on) it started to work on me. The movie slowly gets more and more dark and disturbing leading to a tragic end. I saw this on LOGO so if there was any explicit sex or nudity it was cut out (Montgomery bares his butt once and that's about it) but the gore was kept in and it WAS needed for the story. This is no classic horror movie but Long and Montgomery are likable (and hot guys) and it DOES become very disturbing at the end. Worth a look--especially for gay horror fans. I give it a 6. 
tt0100251; The rock star Brian Walker (Warwick Sims) is surprised by his wife Nicky (Tanya Roberts) shagging a woman in the bathroom in a party. Nicky asks the divorce, and Brian hires a security company to spy on her to prove that she is unfaithful and has love affairs. The security guard Will Griffith (Andrew Stevens) hides a camera in her bedroom and peeps on Nicky having sex with her lover but he hides the truth from Brian. Will protects Nicky from the violent Brian and they have a love affair. Nicky gets a restraint order against Brian and one night he breaks in the house and Will, who has fallen in love with Nicky, kills him with three shots. Will is prosecuted for the death of Brian, and he finds that Brian apparently was not the responsible for the aggressions to Nicky. Will investigates and discovers the truth about the whole case. "Night Eyes" was a successful erotic thriller in the 90's, when I saw this movie twice. Today I have decided to watch my VHS again and the sexy femme fatale Tanya Roberts really makes this flick worthwhile. The flawed story has a reasonable development but the conclusion is absolutely disappointing and senseless. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Olhos Noturnos" ("Night Eyes") 
tt0100251;  Better then you might expect sex thriller finds Andrew Stevens being security guard for sexy Tanya Roberts who is in the middle of a multi-million dollar divorce. However, the better he gets to know her, the more he wants her and soon the two of them are engaged in a passionate affair. Not much plot wise to recommend about this movie, but Tanya Roberts good performance keeps you watching and the sex scenes are nice and steamy with the score providing just the right touch. Unrated, Extreme Sexual Content, Nudity, Mild Violence. 
tt0100251; The most common description used about "Night Eyes", both on this board and elsewhere, is "eroticÂ thriller", no fewer than seven of the previous twelve reviewers use this phrase. It is not, however, a particularly accurate description. The phrase "eroticÂ thriller" generally suggests a softcore porno film in which a generic thriller plot is used to provide the links between, and a rationale for, numerous sex scenes. There have, of course, been plenty of films of that type, but this is not one of them. Although an adulterous love affair forms the mainspring of the plot, there are no actual love scenes and no nudity. There is a lot more eroticism in some mainstream Hollywood thrillers from thisÂ period such as "Fatal Attraction". Nikki Walker, the estranged wife of a millionaire British rock star, hiresÂ Night Eyes, a firm of security consultants, to provide security at her mansion. Unknown to her, however, the company has been bribed by her husband Brian to spy on her and find evidence that she is having an affair. Brian Walker and his lawyer believe that if they can find such evidence they will be able to achieve a much more favourable financial settlement from the courts. (This implies that the Californian courts take, or at least took in the early nineties, a very moralistic attitude to divorce. I cannot imagine a British court reducing a wife's financial settlement on the grounds that she had formed a sexual relationship with another man after separating from her husband). Things, however, do not go according to plan. Will Griffith, the bodyguard who is supposed to be spying on Nikki, falls in love with the attractive young woman. Not only does he hide from Brian's lawyer the fact that Nikki is having an affair with Michael Vincent, a film star, he also begins sleeping with her himself. The movie then chronicles the disastrous consequences of this relationship. The best among the cast is probably the little-known actor Warwick Sims as the hedonistic, self-obsessed rock star Brian, probably based on a combination of several British rockers from around this period. (No names mentioned). None of the other actors, however, makes any impression. Tanya Roberts could hardly be described as little-known, indeed, as a Playboy model and Charlie's Angel and Bond Girl she was a well-known celebrity during the eighties and early nineties. Her fame, however, had more to do with her looks than with her talent, a quality with which she was notably under-endowed. (Having a Hollywood scriptwriter for a husband probably helped as well). Here she seems to wander through the film as though in a trance, unable to connect with anyone around her. She had already received two Razzie "Worst Actress" nominations for "Sheena" and "A View to a Kill", and was lucky not to receive a third here. Andrew Stevens as Will is slightly better, but "slightly better than dreadful" is hardly high praise. In 1990 some people obviously liked this film, it was a financial success at the box-office, having been made on a very small budget, andÂ spawned three sequels, none of which I have seen. Today, however, it comes across as a very poor example of the standard nineties thriller, with second-rate (or in Roberts' case third-rate) acting and a hackneyed paranoid plot revolving around the questions of "who can trust whom?" and "who is betraying whom?" Less erotic thriller than neurotic thriller. 4/10 
tt0100251;  Well, I stole my summary comment from another film, but that is what this movie is about.  Tanya Roberts and her rock-star husband (boy, does this creep fall short of her) are falling out, he hires a security guard to spy on her, they then get it on, and thus the guard has a conflict of interest. Sex scenes and videotapes and trickery are all around.  Tanya is the sympathetic figure for most of the film, but slowly and subtly the femme fatale is revealed.  The ending is disappointing--one of those situations in which it then seems the movie has no meaning. 
tt0100251;  Tanya Roberts and Andrew Stevens together heat up the screen in this scorching erotic thriller.  I swear, I think (referring to UNRATED version here,) that this is the biggest amount of sex scenes I've ever seen in a movie!!!Well, I don't want to spoil the plot for anyone,-)Basically Nikki (Tanya Roberts) hires Will Griffith (Andrew Stevens)  to be her security guard.  Trouble with her scuzzy ex-husband ensues, and Will and Nikki have wild passionate sex from there on out every 71/2 minutes of screen time.  But, Nikki has some secrets of her own...I loved this movie.  It's my favorite erotic thriller because of Andrew Stevens (great job, Andrew), and Tanya Roberts, although this is the only erotic thriller I've seen her in.  I feel the major faults of the movie, are few, but there could have been a bit more character development in the case of Tanya.  Overall, sumptuous sets in her mansion.  A true winner.  But I think this will probably ONLY be liked by straight-to-video erotic thriller fans.**Review based on UNRATED version**Parental Discretion Advised:Contains:Nudity(a lot) Sex(every 10 minutes) Violence Profanity (not much) 
tt0100251; In the early 1990s, there was a craze in Hollywood (mostly in the direct-to-video industry) for the "erotic thriller". After several years the craze came to an end and has not made a comeback, probably for one simple reason - these movies were awful, and "Night Eyes" is no exception. For a real cheapie, I'll admit that the production values aren't too bad, and the acting by most of the players is passable. But the movie is for the most part a chore to sit through. I rented the unrated version, but there is surprisingly not a lot of nudity (and no full-frontal nudity) or on screen sex. In fact, there is only one scene that I found was erotic (and only mildly so), and it happens after more than an hour of the running time has passed. Maybe others might find this movie hot - the movie was popular enough to spawn three sequels - but as for me, I was bored by the experience. 
tt0100251; This wallow is an "erotic thriller" and we can be certain of that because it is called so upon the home video box. There are many examples of this seamy genre, particularly prevalent since the late 1980s, the film under discussion here being perhaps the most financially rewarding, earning more than 30 million dollars above its production cost of $750,000, but only a rabid fan of this cinematic category may consider it to be an artistic success, as well. A very small company, Night Eyes Security, composed of two Griffith brothers, is tasked with guarding the Beverly Hills estate of a British pop musician, Brian Walker, and his wife Nikki (Tanya Roberts) but after she discovers her husband making the grade with a young woman during a party in their home, Mrs. Walker files for divorce, following which Mr. Walker hires Night Eyes to supposedly protect his soon-to-be former wife at their Malibu residence, although his true purpose is to obtain damning video tapes from surveillance cameras that he hopes will record Nikki's own sexual misconduct, thereby crystallizing his courtroom defense for their looming civil trial. The younger of the brothers, Will (Andrew Stevens, who also produces here as well as contributing heavily to the screenplay), a rather artless character, does in fact espy Nikki in flagrante delicto, but this apparently fortuitous event for Brian is nullified because Will has succumbed to the physical charms of the wayward wife and has decided to withhold the evidential tape from the musician and his attorney, played by able supporting player Paul Carr, causing a viewer to recognize that the lovestruck security guard can not be considered as an example of rectitude. Becoming involved in his duties well beyond the operation and maintenance of his mini-company's surveillance equipment, Will is delighted as Nikki ostensibly matches his passion, as is evident from a cluster of scenes wherein the two explore each other's private areas, but complications appear when murder, rape and sundry other felonies occur in conjunction with their affair, Will being the primary suspect for the crimes. The substantial profit garnered by this movie prompted production of three sequels, each continuing the amourous adventures of young Will and his trusty spy cameras, and even though their potential merits cannot be determined by this viewer, the first number in the series does provide an unexpected element of suspense in addition to capable costuming from Ha Nguyen, fine stunt performing, and a polished turn from Carr. An unrated version is available that seemingly promises to provide additional footage of the ardent romantic actions shared by the mismatched lovers. 
tt0100251; A security expert (Andrew Stevens) is hired to watch over a millionare's soon to be ex-wife (Tanya Roberts), but temptation proves to be to much for Stevens. And he is thrown head long into an affair with Roberts.This hot, steamy erotic romantic thriller features near X rated sexual encounters. This film will definately cause a few temperatures to raise. This is one movie that can truly be classified as erotic.Tanya Roberts is very good and looks very good, especially naked. Andrew Stevens is nothing more then scenery and turns in what can be described as a clunky performance. But still don't let that turn you away, this is very good for a  erotic thriller. Released in a few theaters before going to video. My rating is a 7.5 out of 10.Night Eyes is unrated and contains Strong Sexual Content, Nudity, Violence, and some Language. 95 very hot minutes. 
tt0100251; Washed-out drunken rock star Brian Walker is having sex in the bathroom at his party and his wife Nikki (Tanya Roberts) catches him. He immediately announces their divorce in front of the guests. He hires security guards Ernie and Will Griffith (Andrew Stevens) to spy on her. They install cameras around her home as well as a secret one in her bedroom. Will watches her have sex with Michael Vincent. He hides it from Brian. He becomes obsessed and starts an affair himself with her. Brian runs into them at a gallery and gets combative. Brian breaks in one night and Will chases him off. After almost running over her, Nikki gets a restraining order against Brain despite his claim of an alibi. Brian comes in with a gun and Will shoots him but there's more to the story.The plot is actually functional considering its B-movie nature. The acting is pretty stiff and the production is second rate. Stevens and Roberts are basically good enough and pretty enough to do the job. There is some T&A but it's not actually the main driver in this movie. The twist isn't unexpected. This is either a well written soft porn movie or a weakly made real movie. 
tt0100251; I'm not giving this film a vote because -- Tanya Roberts or no Tanya Roberts -- I couldn't get through the first few minutes. Evidently a lot of people have, which explains why democracy can never be a success.It's a turn off from the very beginning. The colors are achingly lurid, mostly a kind of neon blue. The acting is about at the level you'd find in a high school play in Freeport, New Jersey. The writing is terrible, as far as I could tell. Two times in the opening minutes, people shout orders at one another followed by an intensifying "now," as in, "Drop the gun in the fireplace -- NOW!" Here's an example of the direction. A would-be rapist is escaping from an apartment and runs into a security guard. The guard takes a swing at the miscreant and misses by a mile. Then he simply stands still, his fists clenched, while his opponent takes his time winding up and finally belting him on the jaw.In 1982 "Body Heat" was a great success, and it deserved to be -- a slice of colorful neo-noir, that was called an "erotic thriller." That means a combination of suspense, action, nudity, and simulated coitus. It gave rise to a spate of imitations. Some of them were enjoyable. "Unlawful Entry," for instance, is commercial junk but it's well written, involving, and gives us a villain who is human in his flaws.This one stinks, but it apparently revived a genre that was slowly slipping into Cheyne-Stokes breathing. Too bad. 
tt1992147; I almost didn't watch this because I tend to steer clear of movies with a rating below 5 but once I read the synopsis I was hooked. It sounded like the kind of movies I typically enjoy and I was not disappointed. It's listed as a thriller but I definitely found some dark comedy in it especially once some of the other characters entered the movie. Lindsay Rose Binder, the lead, has only done one other film but I liked her and thought she did a great job portraying the single woman so desperate to find love she goes to extreme measures once she finds a potential catch. Nothing justified her crazy action but I have to say that even though she was insane I didn't completely hate her because the guy was definitely a jerk. I had to wonder at the end if she would ever find someone to fit into her insane idea of the perfect relationship. 
tt1992147; Norman is a busy, successful real estate agent who is deeply interested in making money, no matter how much time it takes. He likes his girl friends, but tends to cycle them, a new one every so many weeks. Dori, however, gets him to go on a long weekend early enough in the relationship that he decides to go.Dori has surprises from the beginning. She goes through the 'I love you' dance a bit early. The next morning, Dori introduces Albert and Dolly, her son and daughter. Then she introduces her grandfather and grandmother as well. Norman is by no means ready or willing for this to happen.Norman attempts to leave, but Dori has sawed off the steering wheel on his Porsche. This is where he needed to do anything he could to leave. He comes close to it, but his cell phone reception is poor. Dori slams him over the head with an iron, then ties him down to a bed. The kids are on with it, as are grandpa and grandma.The festive tortures that the kidnappers put Norman through are both ordinary and disgusting. They celebrate all sorts of holidays during the long weekend: Valentine's Day, Easter, Father's Day. They tie him up with duct tape, chain his legs together, then make fun of him when he cannot hold his bladder after a long time.Norman does his best to leave, but the ball and chains make it difficult. They talk, and talk, and talk.Norman does get free, locks Dori away, then starts to run away. Dori suckers him in by yelling that Dolly had trouble breathing. This was an horrid moment, when Norman's small piece of compassion is leveraged by this family of psychos. They re-capture him, then subject him to Christmas carols while dressed for Halloween.Norman knows he's in trouble when the New Year's celebration involves voting, rather like the voting in an elimination derby, such as Survivor. Is there any way out for Norman?------Scores--------Cinematography: 8/10 Well done.Sound: 10/10 No problems.Acting: 8/10 I liked the performances of the veteran actors. The child actors did well in their roles.Screenplay: 7/10 Story makes sense in a sick sort of way.-----Conclusions-------A bit too much of the PC bovine scatology. Dori sounds oh, so calm and clear and philosophical as she drags Norman's body into the shed. This is one of the harshest crushings of the human spirit I have seen in quite a while. This is horror at its purest, not a thriller, as billed. 'I still believe in love,' says the kidnapping multiple murderess at the end. A much better ending would be that Norman escapes when he had the chance, comes back with police, and the four kidnappers are killed in a hail of bullets. That would have been a thriller, as opposed to this embrace of murderous madness. 
tt1992147; Ostensibly marketed as a thriller, this little independent film is anything but. It's more akin to a black-comedy that has vaguely thriller elements. I didn't mind the 'all women are nuts' undercurrent running through the film, as its merely a flip side of all the 'guys are evil pigs' Lifetime TV movies out there. What I did mind was that all the characters were rubbish, improperly motivated and felt unrealistic (even In the confines of the movie) I got some chuckles out of the grandparents played by veterans Charlotte Rea and M. Emmet Walsh, however not enough to say that this silly lil movie is worth watching.Eye Candy: Katia Winter is topless for all of one second 
tt1992147; This movie meets Misery with a twist of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, great movie, well written, Katia Winter is perfect as Kathy Bates. This movie would make a great boyfriend girlfriend movie to watch together. Love sick love would make a great husband wife movie to watch together. The movie uses great props, great usage of automobiles, great usage of homes. The grandparents home reminds you of the great movie Psycho. Love sick love passes as a realistic movie, something that could very easily happen to you or I. Love sick love is a must see for any serious movie watcher or movie critic. The movie was released in 2013 and should win many awards for great acting, great writing, great camera work, this movie should leave you with a sense to look closely at your very own relationships, rent or buy this movie is worth the green money. Enjoy the movie. 
tt1992147; First, what is with the ratings on IMDb. Seems like bull. Man was it entertaining. I will watch this friends next time. Rotten Tomatoes gave this good enough props audience anyway. who the hell believes critics? I thought i'd check it out Sunday night. It gave me gas watching the man get tied up and rolled up and pushed around by the family. I nearly crapped myself when Norman decided to think of the kid instead of his sorry self getting kidnapped by a bunch of hillbillies. I once had a girl, a serious girlfriend not just a fling, tell me she had never been married before... Not only was she married, she had four kids from different men and she was looking to find a father for all of them. No way in hell do I want to raise another man's spawn. It's called responsibility as they say, 'Not My Kid Not My Problem'. This movie was twisted and alright. And save your money. OBLIVION is garbage. 
tt1992147; For those out on the single scene, there's so much of the dialogue in this movie that makes you cringe only b/c you've said it or you've definitely heard someone else say it. Katia Winter does an amazing job with this role & carries the cast quite well. Really interesting role for Matthew Settle. What can be left to be said about Charlotte Rae? She's a class act from start to finish & this is a role I never thought I'd see her in (she's still Facts of Life Den Mom for me). The director & screenwriter must be some kinda warped if any of this is related to any of their own dating experiences. All in all, Really Great Flick and a refreshing change from the usual that's currently out, Engrossing from start to finish. Makes you wish for a Part Two too. 
tt1992147; For an unemployed single mother of two a Porsche driving company owner sure seems like the man of her dreams, but it is not the same for him. Her unrealistic expectations turn to bitter disappointment when her 'I love you' is not reciprocated, and she becomes vengeful. She expects a lifelong financial support both for her and her two kids in exchange for some bedroom and occasional kitchen action, and that is what she calls Love, and being in touch with her emotions! The storyline portrays psychotic, but comments on ordinary, everyday relationships. A sad state of gender affairs. Bitter, but all too realistic film.Seduction that turns into obsession, and then torture. Comments on family as 'ball and chain' for the male, in this movie literally. This is a serious date movie, not a romantic comedy. It is not a triller, but social commentary. 
tt1992147; This movie had an interesting plot and had quite a few twists and turns. The idea of surviving holidays with a new boyfriend is different. I would recommend it as a date movie as it definitely gave my date and I a few conversation pieces. I've always been a great fan of Charlotte Rae and she didn't disappoint as a crazy, yet kind grandmother. It's also great to see newcomer Katia Winter play a very convincing psycho. It was a good mix of laughs yet the suspense made for some great goose bump moments. In this day and age of internet dating, this movie seems appropriate as a cautionary tale for those in the dating world. 
tt1992147; I'm single and living in Vegas. There's nothing more terrifying to me then bedding one of the millions of scumdolls who descend on the Strip. So yeah this movie is more like a warning label the government should put on dating sites and bar counters. The problem is that women go into relationship with too high an expectation. Relax. You're on a date. It it doesn't work out, obviously, you were attractive enough to get a date in the first place. And the other thing leave your kids out of it. Seriously. It's mental to drag family and kids into your dating life. Mental. This film is NOT a horror by the way, Thank God. I can't stomach guts and gore. It's just one of my really really bad nightmares played out on screen. I am passing this to all my bros. Heads up. 
tt0820914; Just watched Left for Dead and loved it! I don't know why the haters come on here and disregard the talent of these independent artists! I thought the story was basic, but fitting for this slasher flick. Overall it was a really fun film and I think anyone looking for a horror film done in the same flavor as the classics will love Left for Dead!I also want to mention the great work done by the special FX people. All of the masks were awesome especially the killers mask well done! If anyone knows how I can get a copy of this please message me. I would love to add it to my collection of horror films! 
tt0820914; what the .....when the film started i want to turn it out...the picture looked were cheap, and so the torture goes on, i cant describe how bad this film is....the story okay...nothing new, but that not the matter, the actors are not so good, the effects are bad, dialogs are bad....to make it faster..."everything" is bad, don't understand how the film get a rating of 5. the problem is....maybe this film was good before 30-40 years...but now...this is very bad, like Texas chainsaw....if you look that today...it is really bad, so i vote the films at the time i see them. i don't want to write a penny dreadful, so .... do your self a favor and skip this one ! sorry for the English, greetings from cologne, Germany 
tt0820914; I remember reading a brief article in Fangoria back in '07 when this was being made. It sounded pretty decent, albeit, treading familiar territory, but since it has Danielle Harris in it, I didn't think it would be too bad. I was so wrong. I just finished watching this. It's not only bad, but terribly boring.Here is the plot. Five frat brother's accidentally cause the death of a young man who stole the wallet of one the brother's during their annual "Devil's Night." One year later (shades of IKWYDLS anyone?) during their Halloween party, the frat brother's and their girlfriends begin to die, one by one, at the hands of a masked killer brandishing a machete.Yes, this sounds like every other revenge slasher before and after IKWYDLS, but I still thought it had potential. The acting was sub-par, at best, the violence and gore disappointingly minimal, and the killer from far threatening. The Halloween mask looks like it costs $10 at Wal-Mart. None of the characters (with the exception of Danielle Harris' character, Nancy and her boyfriend Tommy) were worth rooting for. Hell, even Tommy's character really wasn't worth rooting for. All he did was whine and whine about what had happened last year. Not much more. The only real positive thing in this movie was the body count. It was actually pretty decent.I cannot for the life of me understand why the wonderful Danielle Harris saw in this project. She was woefully underused, and her role was nothing but to be the weak-willed victim that graced many 80s slashers.For something that had so much PR hype going on for it, it sure delivered poorly. In my opinion, only watch it for Danielle Harris. Other that that, it isn't worth the 78 minutes of your life that you will waste on it. 
tt0820914; I came across this film at random on a late night. It's a good film, made like an 80's slasher. Masked killer hunting down frat boys with a knife due to a secret they share in the past. Not groundbreaking, but still a decent concept. Nice story and talented young actors, especially solid performance from Steve Byers and Shawn Roberts. The older actors seem to not care as mush about the film though, poor performance. Which was too bad, even if you disregard the bad acting it ruins the experience. It's a cute nod to all the old horror films, complete with blood, gore and basic nudity. As a fan of old horror, it was worth watching. 
tt0820914; This may not be the worst movie of all time, but it at least deserves to be in the top 10. Horrid acting, over-dramatized scenarios, unbelievable scenes and situations, and the best looking nude may have been a 6. I'm being generous. Normally I would have given this film a 2 or 3 (depending on how drunk I am) rating, but I feel I must give it a 1 to offset the truly poor judge of taste that so many have languished on this film that does little more than lay there and pine for our attentions, using 3rd rate acting and 3rd rate nudity. I could almost swear that one chick had a cesarean scar. I was lured to this crap fest by the IMDb rating. I can only assume that every student at the college that filmed this must have logged in and up'd the ratings. Save your time and don't bother with this one. The worst part of the whole movie is they opened it up for a sequel. 
tt0109760; This was Steven Segal-lookalike Jeff Speakman's third starring role, as a special kind of cop who decides to exact his own brand of vengeance on the man who brutalized and murdered his sister. The guy is convicted and locked away, but this isn't going to stop The Expert. Pretty lame action flick, with a couple of clumsily staged fights and a big showdown in the prison, where the bad guy is about to bust out when Speakman arrives to exact his revenge. Nothing much to recommend here, although I always liked Speakman, who apparently stopped making movies in 2006. However, I think I've seen him on TV occasionally, but I'm not 100 percent sure. Skip this one and check our hero out in The Perfect Weapon instead.. 
tt0109760; John Lomax (Speakman) is a civilian military CQB, or, "Close Quarter Battle" instructor. When his beloved sister Jenny (Nagy) is tragically murdered by a serial killer named Martin Kagan (Shaner), initially Lomax is satisfied when Kagan is sentenced to die by going to the electric chair. When an inexplicably sympathetic doctor, Alice Barnes (Datcher) insists that Kagan is schizophrenic and that any and all murders were committed by his alter ego Martin Mirman, the dangerous psychopath is granted a stay of execution. But not for long, as an incensed Lomax decides to put his CQB skills to work to finally erase Kagan from the planet. But first he needs to get weaponry from his old buddy Snake (Varney) and find time for romance with reporter Liz Pierce (Gracen). Will Lomax's Expertise be enough to get the proper revenge? The Expert starts off in classic Martial Arts movie style, with a shadowy figure displaying his moves as the opening credits roll. Unfortunately, the rest of the film doesn't live up to this promising intro. The actual action scenes are minimal, and Speakman only Kenpo's it up on the baddies a scant few times. The first major action scene feels strangely slow and confused. A lot of the running time is spent as a Prison Slog, with no action whatsoever. Despite the presence of James Brolin as the warden, these scenes are ultimately pointless. We liked the moment when Brolin becomes unhinged, but overall neither he, Speakman, or the rest of the cast can overcome the mediocrity within.Michael Shaner, who we remembered from Bloodfist (1989) where he played the infamous "Baby", and Angelfist (1993), or possibly other movies with the word "fist" in the title, portrays the main baddie in a boo-hiss hateable style. His resemblance to a young Robert Davi made us believe fan favorite Davi also could have assayed the role. Because of the fact that when we first see Martin Kagan he's fixing a copying machine and has ink on his face (and because the camera keeps cutting closer and closer on to his leering face with each successive loud musical stab), we were prepared for a first, an evil copying machine repairman. Sadly, despite the hilariously ham-fisted telegraphing of his evilness, he was just your standard baddie.Let's not forget that Jim Varney is also onboard as a Vietnam vet who works at a store called Gun City USA. Now that's what I call shop 'til you drop. Even though it's a glorified cameo, it was nice to see Ernest himself call Speakman "The Best" and act as this movie's Machine Gun Joe. Elizabeth Gracen played the typical female reporter, this time resembling Teri Hatcher, not to be confused with fellow cast member Alex Datcher. The main problem with The Expert is that it ceases to be an action movie for vast portions of the running time. And anyone renting or buying a Jeff Speakman movie called The Expert isn't expecting that, and it's a disappointment. Supposedly the great Larry Cohen and the equally-great William Lustig had something to do with this production, but went uncredited. We can see why.A prime example of 1995 video store shelf-filler, regrettably, we were not impressed with The Expert. 
tt0109760;  Oh, well I thought it should be a good action, but it was not. Although Jeff Speakman stars there is nothing to watch.Only two fight for almost 1,5 hours, yak.A lot of talking and everything is so artificial that you could not believe it. The plot is clear from the beginning. If you want good action don't rent this movie. 
tt0109760; Jeff Speakman never really made it beyond the lowest ranks of martial-artists-turned-actors (lower than Don "The Dragon" Wilson, for example), and with vehicles like "The Expert", you can see why. There are three major problems with this movie: 1) The plot - or should I say plots - are all over the place, there are some characters who get a lot of screen time but serve little purpose, 2) There are only 4 fight scenes in total, some of them completely unrelated to the main plot and some taking place in the dark, 3) The music score is overzealous and overbearing. Strange as it may seem, this is really the most annoying thing about this film: the score persistently tries to convince you that you're watching some sort of grand epic, instead of the low-budget limited-action film you are indeed watching. With all that said, at least there's James Brolin around to lend a touch of credibility. *1/2 out of 4. 
tt0109760; Poor Jeff Speakman! He should have been the next great martial arts movie god, but didn't make it! He looks so puffy from the 'roids in this movie he can't even move fast! How did he gain so much weight from "Street Knight" in such a short time? Can you say "steroids"?. Too bad, because he is such a normal actor, and much better than the crappy people who stepped into his place after this! I wish he had kept up his progress from his first starring movie, but he went (to me) downhill after his 3rd movie. Too bad, but he seems to be doing great with his martial arts schools, so I am happy for him. I wish he was doing great movies again, but at least he is doing something for the martial arts community. 
tt0109760; i can't say i loved this third film featuring Jeff Speakman in a starring role.but i didn't hate it either.i thought it was a bit better than his second effort,Street Knight,though that's pretty faint praise.this one's a little less boring,and the fighting sequences are a bit better.the acting is not great,though Speakman himself actually isn't too bad,and actually seems to have improved since Street Knight.however i thought Michael Shaner as the Villain was a bright spot in an otherwise dense sea of fog.again,this is one movie that fails to distinguish itself from the rest of the pack and is no more than average for the genre.for me,The Expert is a 5/10 
tt0109760;  THE EXPERT, starring Jeff Speakman, is the definition of DULL!!!Dull, characters, dull situations, dull direction, dull actors, dull cinematography, dull music.I don't really understand this movie. Is it supposed to be an action movie? It's almost as if Speakman wanted to be in a serious movie but the level of acting and writing found in THE EXPERT is below your average TV drama. And there are some typical "Speakman pummeling bad guys" scenes here and there but the main aspect of the movie relies on some sort of believable drama, which is totally wrong for Speakman or is so badly directed that it just doesn't work with the action star. In the end, this confused movie looks and feels very nondescript and bland. The worst aspect of THE EXPERT is the music. The composer is a Jerry Goldsmith wannabe, with his pompous and melodramatic score, which simply doesn't belong in this kind of (dull) movie. It's as if the producers knew they had a very dull product on their hands and they asked the composer to make the film feel more compelling and dramatic with his score, which makes the entire movie look even more confused, goofier and dull.Don't waste your time watching this, even if you're a Jeff Speakman fan. 
tt0109760; This was Speakman's fourth big film, wellÂ  in low budget way. As usual in these low budget action films, he is an former trainer of special units, who seeks revenge. Normally, typically, and as usualÂ  NowÂ  I haven't seen any other Jeff latest film, they are kinda hard to come byÂ  but, he is busy today with Kenpo seminars all over the world and I think it's a good idea to stop when you are supposed to and keep a low profile and do what you like to do. I kinda doubt in Jeff latest filmsÂ  maybe because I am a fan of 90s action films. OK, the story is usual, a sadistic maniac Kagan (played by Michael Shaner, who you probably remember for "Lethal Weapon" (1987), he was the guy who was "saved" by Mel Gibson from suicide jump. He made an interesting performance, but not too well to be noticed for more upcoming roles), kills John's (Speakman) sister and, thereforeÂ  he seeks revengeÂ  his own way. You know, kinda badass and radical. There's actually nothing that quite special in the film, the action scenes were solid, the movie has an interesting music score that fits perfectly in the scenes. Jeff is really good in his fighting scenes, as always. We got actors as James Brolin (as a cold prison warden) and Alex Datcher (as a liberal fighter for convicts rights, or whatever), other actors didn't do anything much with their performances, well what did you expect from a low budget film? ButÂ  here's what's coolÂ  I was quite surprised by this. Jim Varney appears in film as Speakman's war buddy who is a pawn shop owner, and who also supplies Speakman with some cool weapons and equipment for his revenge. Varney is a comedian, but even in this 5 to 6 minute role, he proved otherwise, he was really cool in the role. And I really suggest all Varney fans to check him out here, you'll love it. Ernest P. Worrell can be a badass, I tell you. Well, overall, low budget action film fansÂ  here's a real treat, enjoy it. 
tt0109760; The working title of this film was "Brute Force"I worked on this film and never got paid. It was a typical Hollywood shell game. The production company declared bankruptcy and was bought by a sister company. This film aired on Showtime. My name appeared in the credits.When I called the production company about payment (after airing) they asked I "prove" I worked on the show. LOL. How about my name being in the credits? LOLI was surprised to find it under my name on IMDb. Once again, they credit me with the work, but never paid me. It's so typical of Hollywood. 
tt0109760; Of course I am going to think it was a great movie. I recognized several people I didn't see during filming also. I was the one playing the guard about an hour into the movie in the death row exercise yard asking for a light for a cigarette. I also changed this one scene. They had originally had it set to go into the rec yard and straighten out the inmate and turn him around and walk him out. The Director said "It is taking to long, what would you do Gower." I said, "We need to go in and hook the arms and drag him out backwards. That way your camera can stay on his face as we take him off set." I also lived at this same prison as a young child as my father was the Assistant Warden of Security. I am also a current employee with the Tennessee Deaprtment of Corrections as a supervisor at the Riverbend Maximum Security Institution. Even though a lot of the movie was a joke, the part I was in was reality enough. Also in the bar scene the dancer kicking high in the air and leaving the stage was an actual stripper I use to work with at a club called "The Classic Cat". 
tt0105599; "TIRANGAA" is the story of love, war and patriotism in which todays India is shown in its true colors.Pralay Nath - Gunda Swamy - is a foreign agent who has sown the seeds of terrorism throughout the country. He wants a total destruction of the country followed by a foreign rule. The people who support his evil intentions are some corrupt ministers and police officers. Anyone who dares to raise his voice against them is automatically silenced.After failing in all their efforts to stop this terror, the government appoints a brave and courageous military officer, Brigadier Surya Deo Singh to complete this mission. An equally brave and honest Police Officer Shivaji Rao Wagle joins hands with Surya Deo Singh to complete this mission. Together they attack and destroy Pralayanath's evil empire. But they are unaware of Pralayanath's ultimate weapon. The weapon that can destroy out entire mother land. What is this weapon? Does Pralaynath succeed in his evil intentions? Will the glory and splendor of Tiranga be upheld? The answer to all these questions is "TIRANGAA". 
tt0451166; I am not a "film person," per se. I accompanied my 17 yr. old son to the Newark Black Film Festival because he wants to be a film person, and I wanted to introduce him to the Film Festival world. I found Premium to be witty and hip, as well as, textured and sophisticated. A Black man's story about male/female relationships, strike that, any man's story about non-buddy relationships....now that is groundbreaking in the film world. Not only was it new, it was fun. I also found Chatmon's and Missicks' handling of the Q and A after the film aired kind of engaging, like the entertainment I had seen on the screen, which leads one to believe there is more good film where Premium came from. Premium showcases the strong and confident voices of the cast and the writer/director that deserve to be heard, because they "get it," and give it right back...so that you can be in on the fun and "get it" too! 
tt0451166; I'm a filmmaker myself and I see quite a few films. Premium was one of the most enjoyable and well done films I've seen on the festival circuit this year. Part of the genius is the direction. Pete Chatmon confidently lets this perfectly cast group of actors perform without trying to use any tricks to make the story more interesting or feel like a studio project. Zoe Saldana was excellent as usual but I was pleasantly surprised by the way the lead actor, Dorian Missick was able to handle himself in a cast that includes Hill Harper and Frankie Faison. Something is wrong if Missick does not get more leading roles. I did some research and discovered that the writer/director took his time and developed the script over a number of years. It shows. This is a film that any demographic group would enjoy. I expect to see it in THEATERS early next year. 
tt0451166; Read my past reviews, and you know how rare it is that I sing the praises of any film made after 1985.Premium is one of the best independent films I have ever seen. I realized after the screening at the Urbanworld Film Festival just how much garbage I've watched lately. I hope Mr. Chatmon is able to get a theatrical release so that everyone can have an opportunity to see the movie, but if it does go straight to DVD, it will be a rare gem in the secondary market.I don't want to over-inflate the movie. It wasn't a complex story with a lot of special effects or over the top dramatizations. It was a very simple story that was divinely executed. Everyone did what they were supposed to do. The film maker had enough respect for his audience not be the director, the writer, the star, the key grip and the caterer. He selected his role, he focused on that and hired people to do the rest.It's a character study and a date movie. And its good. I've been a champion of the urban independent film maker for a while. This movie reminded me why...UFC 
tt0451166; I don't believe I have ever seen either Dorian Missick or Zoe Saldana in a movie previously, I loved their chemistry together. I have to say that Zoe Saldana has just become one of my favorite actresses. Her performance was impeccable, and she has great depth as an actress. I appreciate the kind of movie that Mr. Chatmon is bringing to the screen and hope he is blessed with the opportunity to evolve and showcase his talent and fulfill his vision. The movie starts out with an emphasis on the shallow and somewhat pathetic life that "Cool" is currently caught up in. Don't be fooled. The moment Missick and Saldana come together a new dimension opens. This is an enjoyable movie, and I hope it is well supported. Most people are searching for good movies to watch, tell someone to pick it up. 
tt0451166; I usually don't do this but I've recently started following the chat rooms on PREMIUM and it's been very rewarding to see the response. When we set out to make this film, from a script I started writing in 1999, our objective was to show that emotion and the human experience is something that is universal. I believe we have succeeded in doing that. Putting black characters in the film does not make it only accessible to black people and this film has something for everyone. After all the festivals, reviews, comments, and awards the film has received, it seems like we're striking the right chord and people agree. PREMIUM is all about adding more to the cinematic menu so be sure to check it out when we hit theaters and DVD later this year! Spread the word... 
tt0451166; Apparently the MANY movies that imizrahi2002 claims to have seen have not opened his brain to great film making!! LOL (you shouldn't toot your horn so much) Thanks for not writing that book you said you could write. (close call there)Anyway...This is a simple movie with a timeless story told in a very new way. It shows how a story doesn't have to be convoluted to be interesting. And how complicated life can get in the blink of an eye.If you like the same story, but told with amazing Hollywood special effects, explosions and Harry-Potter-type plots..... Then listen to IMIZRAHi2002's review. (he or she should see a lot more independent and story-based films before talking the way he/she has about this type of movie. (that is MY opinion on his/her review ) 8-) Judge for yourself.... Great film for a night when explosions and effects are not what you are looking for. A funny, smart, heartfelt, intelligently written film. 
tt0451166; This movie got my attention while flipping cable channels. Its one of the better love movies out there that no one knows about and is a must have if you are into Black cinema or not. I haven't really seen Dorian in action before but have become a fan of his work. Zoe is of course a beautiful woman and only gets better. The plot is also great and well written, it could be considered a perfect date movie or one that you watch when you just want to stay home and cuddle with your significant other. I don't know why this movie didn't get more headlines during its preview and release (it should have), but the fact that its not a well known movie actually makes it a better movie. 
tt0451166; An enticing film - you begin to watch and within minutes you want to know how it ends. I think there's something in all of us that always hopes for it to work out for the guy, to see him get the girl. While this movie delivers that in a sense, it doesn't leave you with a traditional happy ending.While the lead male role was performed well I didn't feel like it was very emotionally connecting. Perhaps that's just a reflection of his character, always playing it 'cool' and never really letting you know what's going on in his head. The role didn't offer much chance for an emotional curve.Opposite the lead male role there is Zoe Saldana's character, and seeing this movie after knowing she's been in two of the biggest films in 2009 you begin to understand why. An impeccably understated yet convincing and satisfying performance. Quite simply a grace to watch on screen.The other aspect that stuck out to me was the music - I would love to have this soundtrack playing in my home.This movie is like a little gem you hide away in your private stash, only sharing with someone special, and only then watching once every so often, yet thoroughly enjoying it every time. 
tt0451166; When will the director do more movies like this one. A really good romantic comedy. The lead character was very annoying which made interested in what made him tick, sort of the anti-hero if you will. the scenes between he and Zoe Saldana's chemistry were dead on. I could watch Zoe all day in any movie any time. Only thing i didn't care for was the CUT TO's. it got kind of choppy at times, but other than that i was thoroughly pleased. I could totally relate to the characters. I can't remember seeing a African American independent romantic comedy. Thanks. Now do another one please don't disappear like so many talented directors do. 
tt0451166; FABULOUS!, "Premium" is about a woman (Zoe Saldana) who is about to get married, but after going to a gas station, she surprisingly meets her ex fiancA©, Cool. Old memories come back to her and she tries to scurry away before they can engulf her thoughts and make her think twice about her engagement. The problem is she ends up in a car accident and right back at that same gas station to get her car fixed and maybe her relationship(s) fixed too. Her fiancA© meets Cool. Cool reacts. Her fiancA© reacts. She reacts. Watch the movie to find out how these three work this confusing situation out.Pros: I spent 75% of the time watching this movie peeking through my fingers. There were so many uncomfortable moments (I mean that in a good way--as in, I felt like I was Zoe Saldana's character and pretty much every reaction she went through, I could sympathize with her), and I kept mumbling "Aw man, this is awkward." The beginning was shaky, the middle was interesting, and the end was exactly how I expected it to end, but not how I wanted it to end. I'm not a hopeless romantic, I'm a realist. But sometimes realists can be romantics too. In this movie, romance and love meet with the ideals of marriage and the decisions made are hard but true. Hill Harper is a GREAT actor. I hadn't followed his acting career at all up until this moment, but I had to grin at the bed/blanket scene. That was definitely a switch of roles! Best Scene: The garlic scene--you know you're comfortable in a relationship when you can talk like that to each other, plus the face Zoe made was hilarious. I thought that scene was very cute. 
tt0099300;  Along with Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino, Robert Duvall brings to the screen the best film acting of our generation.  Unlike the other two, he can shape a "typical" role into something original and unique.  Through emotional shadings and nuance, Duvall has created a remarkable gallery of Southern characters, each individualized despite having many surface traits in common.  Surely DeNiro and Pacino are highly skilled actors, but the best performances of each resemble one another to a fault.  Duvall has made his share of potboilers and worse, yet his most substantial roles have generated performances of singular quality.One of them is in "Convicts."  The others?  Don't miss "The Apostle," "Rambling Rose," "Tender Mercies," "Stars Fell on Henrietta," and "Tomorrow." 
tt0099300; "Convicts" is very much a third act sort of film. All the dialogue and character interaction that occurs within it comes out of the long wind-down of a late southern day. And, by extension, the life of its main character, Soll (Robert Duvall).This is the first collaboration of director Peter Masterson and writer Horton Foote. Six years earlier, the worked together on "The Trip to Bountiful", a film that seems almost action-packed in comparison to this one. Masterson is not necessarily a good director. In fact, he's just barely this side of adequate. The slow pace leaves a lot of room for cinematographer Toyomichi Kurita, who infuses the film with just the right sense of fragile light & warmth.Because this is essentially a filmed play, with little in the way of editing or directing prowess, it all comes to the acting. As far as I'm concerned there's no flaws here. Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones, two of the best American actors (both born in January 1931), create characters that are wholly real, uninterested in anything besides living. Lukas Haas, a young actor who I was familiar with from "Testament" and "Witness", plays a character very much like his other early roles. He is quiet, withdrawn, slightly scared and sad, somehow. These are qualities that seem natural from him.Perhaps a title like "Convicts" is a disservice to this film. That title, along with the opening scene, seem to create an image of a far more high-strung western type picture. If slow-paced stage productions don't interest you terribly, you'll want to pass on this one as well. Otherwise, this might be exactly the film you wish they made more often.Enjoy. 
tt0099300;  Robert Duvall gives a creditable performance as the supervisor of a convict farm in 1902 Texas who befriends a young boy (Lukas Haas). The screenplay, written by Horton Foote, contrasts the difficulties of growing up and growing old. Duvall's character is senile and suffering ill health. He alienates himself from family and associates - except for a former convict assigned to his charge, the young boy who reminds him of his youth, and a couple who live in the village store.It's a nice set piece, and the warm colors create a real feeling of turn-of-the-century South. While Duvall's character could have been fleshed out more, he does an excellent job as a man intent on dying on his own terms with help from his young charge 
tt0099300;  If you care for fine acting and excellent characterization, try this film. It doesn't take the commercial, slick, easy approach to the storyline about the reason for use of convict labor on Southern plantations, or about the treatment of the convicts unlucky enough to be doing time at hard labor. Filled with well-thought-out glimpses of the declining southern gentry, the economics of plantation ownership, racism, and other tough subjects, it is also a commentary on human fragility. 
tt0099300;  Robert Duvall is one of America's treasures. He should be given a Lifetime Achievement Award annually at the Academy Award ceremonies, and this film allows him to demonstrate, once again, how it's done. If you agree, by all means run, don't walk, to your nearest video store and rent "Rambling Rose", another of Duvall's gems...which, incidentally, also co-stars Lukas Haas, another underrated and terrific actor, as he shows in "Convicts". Most of Lukas' contribution is in the form of reaction to Duvall's ramblings, but the two of them, along with everyone else in the film, create a marvelous since of realism. Duvall is a mentally addled old drunk who can't remember that he said the same thing to you a few minutes ago, or what you told him, and it's to Duvall's credit that he manages to avoid being boring, as this sort of character so easily could have been. Duvall's character is also disreputable and mistreats the convict labor he has contracted for to work on his farm, but still you empathize with him. Lukas is, as always, wide-eyed (no one had larger eyes, or used them better) and innocent but not stupid. Horton Foote provided realistic dialog and a sure sense of place. This is a film not only to enjoy, but to study. 
tt0099300; Soll (Robert Duval) is a sugar plantation owner in southern Texas, 1902. We catch up with him on the last day of his life when he is not doing so well, having become quite senile. He repeats himself, relives old events, asks the same questions multiple times (getting the same answers). As might be expected, Duval creates a believable character, but I have to admit that spending an hour and a half with Soll served mainly to convince me of how difficult it would be to deal with such a person. I wasn't there, so I don't know what things were like in southern Texas at the turn of the century, but the atmosphere created in this movie struck me as believable. I had never understood that some of the southern plantations were sugar cane plantations, so that was interesting to see portrayed. At the time of this movie the workers in the field were leased convicts, almost exclusively black. It seems that over three decades after the Civil War the only change in plantation workers was from slaves to leased convicts, who were treated as slaves. Soll did trust one black man (played by James Earl Jones) to help run the plantation. You got the feeling from this film that a certain era was slowly nearing an end from a time when people like Soll proudly wore his Confederate uniform and convicts were treated like slaves to somewhat better times (convict leasing was abolished in Texas in 1910). Soll can be seen as a symbol for a way of life that had grown old and no longer viable.I was impressed with how Horace, a teenage white boy in the house, was so patient with Sol. The relationship between Soll and Horace was a key element in the movie--as one man was leaving the earth a young man who was more understanding and patient was taking his place. I imagine Horace's experiences on the plantation were something for him to sort through for the rest of his life, particularly the racial issues.The movie is based on a play and much of it gives evidence to that fact. 
tt0099300; In today's world of digital fabrication, there is no computer than can replace the actor and writer. Alas, this type of "character driven" film is far too rare these days. Duvall's performance as well as James Earl Jones are faithful to their audience's high expectations. I wonder if this movie was made for TV? It has a "close-up" personal quality to the narrative. It is an understatement to say that the performances are all Outstanding. The only thing that keeps it from being a cinema Masterpiece is the lack of a great Cinematographer, but pretty pictures are not everything. How can talent the likes of Jones and Duvall continue to produce such fine work in an age where actors pose for the digitizing? 
tt0099300; Like many stage adaptations, this film is a collection of set pieces without a tight overarching narrative. Not only is it adapted from the stage, but from the middle of a three-act play, which serves to remove some of the context, the viewer is just plopped into the middle of this one. I thought the performances were good overall, but the production was somewhat lacking. Perhaps the streaming version I saw was a bad transfer, but the cinematography was nothing to write home about, the contrast was way too high in many of the daylight scenes, and the colors looked as if the film was shot on old, faded film stock. A bit of a strange soundtrack too, but I liked it and I thought it was fitting. I would recommend it if you like Foote, Faulkner, or Duvall. 
tt0099300; When I first saw this film on cable, it instantly became one of my favorite movies. I'm a big fan of James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall. The movie paints an accurate picture of the South and the racist attitudes. Most of the attitudes came from Soll, an old plantation owner who uses convicts for labor. Soll is what makes the move, his funny ramblings give us insights in to the way The South was back then. I suppose that if Soll lived today he would be diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease. None the less his attitudes towards a little boy who comes to work for him and the convicts is complex. While he has racist views, he's grown to trust some of the convicts who are all black. The two convicts he trusts most are Jackson(Mel Winkler) and Ben(James Earl Jones). The conversations between Ben and Soll are the best in the movie, they have real chemistry. James Earl Jones and Mel Winkler both but in great performances as well as Hass.This movie should have gotten more notoriety. However it's on DVD and worth the money.Rayvyn 
tt0099300; Holy crap. This was the worst film I have seen in a long time. All the performances are fine, but there is no plot. Really! No plot! A bunch of clowns talk about this and that and that's your film. Ug... Robert Duvall's character is senile and keeps asking the same people the same qestions over and over. This earns him the same responses over and over. I am pretty sure this film got upto a six because people think they should like it. Good performances with famous and well regarded actors, but the actual complete work is a steamy turd. Well, maybe that's a bit deceptive since steam rising from a fresh pile sounds a little like something happening and in this film NOTHING HAPPENS! Sack 
tt0063683; It's kind of interesting reading some of the negative raps on this movie. Yes, it is in black and white--so is "Citizen Kane" and any number of other classic movies. The girls are a little long in the tooth to be schoolgirls and the nude scenes are pretty tame (but there certainly are some in the unedited version). However, considering that hot lesbian action between actual schoolgirls is a no-no even today in most countries, it's not surprising they didn't try to pull it off in 1968. Besides, it was necessary that at least one of the actresses be older as she had to play the same character as both a schoolgirl and a middle-aged woman.I'm sure this movie is not exactly like the book (few movies are), but I was impressed at how it managed to combine memorable passages from the book with discreet and tasteful visuals to create some truly startling scenes. (And this is no mean feat--witness Adrian Lyne's ham-handed attempts at this in his recent adaptation of the literary classic "Lolita").This movie also deals with a lot of themes that were pretty taboo at the time--pre-marital sex, lesbianism, female masturbation--in a tasteful, non-exploitative way, which many people probably won't appreciate today living in the age of Howard Stern. This movie certainly inspired a lot of later movies-- "Don't Deliver Us from Evil", "Heavenly Creatures", and the more recent "Lost and Delirious". It's less melodramatic than any of these--nobody commits suicide or is brutally murdered-- but then again most real-life adolescent lesbian relationships don't end in murder or suicide. If you're a Howard Stern fan you probably will be bored with this, but if you don't object to subtle, classy European art films this is pretty alright. 
tt0063683; It was a serious attempt to show the developing sexuality of two schoolgirls and did not try to exploit its factÂ  Even by today's standards, the film is interesting and provocativeÂ  Therese and Isabelle are both attending the same girl's schoolÂ  Therese is energetic, intelligent, and becomes a mentor for the innocent, naive, sweet IsabelleÂ  She guides her through a number of exotic experiences, including a trip through an exclusive brothel, into her first lesbian liaison, and indirectly into her first heterosexual experienceÂ  The film does not exploit any sex, nor is there an abundance of nudity... The imagery is effective, but sometimes the camera lingers too long, and the story goes slowlyÂ  The director, Radley Metzger, went on to make a number of explicit erotic films under the name of Henry ParisÂ  He always has extremely detailed stories, good acting, and very high standards of cinematography...Artistically, however, this is perhaps his most completeÂ  His later attempts supplied for entertainment, whereas "Therese and Isabelle" was a study into the nature of youthful eroticism... 
tt0063683; This is a film.., not porn.This is a wonderful film!!! Full of tender moments and memories!! A beautiful piece of work!!! Excellent!!! For intelligent, viewers only!!!If you are a film lover. A romantic. A person who has loved deeply, this is your film!!!!It has a beautiful surreal quality. Fine acting and directing. Watching this film made me remember my first love.Thi is a film for those who want to reflect on life, love and the meaning of loss.Highly recommended for all film lovers. 
tt0063683; I must admit, when I read the description of the genre on Netflix as "Steamy Romance" I was a little bit skeptical. "Steamy"? In a movie from 1968?? I was prepared for disappointment. And when I realized it was shot entirely in black & white, I knew my erotic hopes were dashed.Boy, was I wrong! Not only does this film have all of the elements of a steamy romance -- the discovery of first love, fear of the secret being found out, a sudden unexpected end -- but at times this movie was downright erotic. You will soon forget that it is shot in black & white. The cinematography deserves every accolade it has received over the years. And the performances from the two stars (Essy Persson and Anna Gael) are intense and memorable. OK, so they're both in their mid twenties trying to play school girls. It's 1968. Do you really expect teenagers from the '60s to be able to effectively explore a lesbian love story like this? Many adult women were still trying to come to grips with their sexuality back then. Anyone looking for real teens here is expecting too much.I think this movie was way ahead of its time. The level of eroticism was an unexpected pleasure, yet it still managed to leave a lot to the imagination, opting instead to give us poetic descriptions to add to what we were shown.I have no doubt lesbians will identify with the characters here. As for you straight guys who love watching lesbians in action: Although it won't be all you expect, I don't think you'll be too, too disappointed. 
tt0063683; This is a very good movie. Good example of a European film of it's time. Black and White? Yes, and for the dolts that can't seem to get through a movie without color, go back to cartoons.Yes, the actresses do seem a bit long in the tooth, but the story is well paced, the cinematography very good, and all in all a pleasant movie.If you're a lesbian, you'll appreciate this movie. If you're a straight man looking for a hot movie... go elsewhere and look for some porn, this ain't it.If you're a movie lover and looking for a good representation of cinema with a lesbian theme, this is a good example. It's also a good example of European cinema in the late 60's even though the moviemaker is an American. 
tt0063683; ************* spoiler alert *************** I am so glad I got to see this wonderful movie.Is there anything more romantics than this line from the movie said in monologue, "We hugged to our hearts all the Thereses and Isabelles who would make love to one another later with other names" I wish the producers would re-release this movie in colour to capture the beauty of the school grounds and the actresses.One of my favourite scenes in the movie is when the camera is panning away from the couple inside the chapel with the monologue lending images through words. I have written down, word for word, the scene inside chapel. Isabelle is waiting for Therese inside the school chapel Isabelle: I missed the train Therese: I missed you Isabelle: I missed you too! Therese: Come closer, you're too far away. Let me do it. Isabelle: If we get caught? Someone may come in. Therese:I don't careTherese pulls her down to the floor and then we don't see the couple, just hear Therese in monologue:I tore her uniform and crushed her beneath, Blood rose in to my cheeks, in to my throat, Her hand was making it difficult for me to breathe, I was sobbing without a sound, without tears, Isabelle was sobbing too. She pressed her hand against my uniform, I dug her neck into my teeth,.............. NO typo- that's what she said :) Her lips tried to find mine, in my hair, in my neck, in the folds of my uniform, I pushed her against the floor, I nailed her hands against it with the palms of mine, I hugged her with all the strength with my repentance, I breathed her in. I held her tight against my belly, and made loin cloth of myself. She was melting my ankles and knees into delicious decay, I burst forth warmth like a fruit, I was filling with the same liquid sweetness, while pins were softly tearing against me, oh so softly. I was following everything in sight, could see with my inner eyes the light in her flesh. In my head I had a Therese, with open legs straining up to the sky, who was receiving all that I was giving. We hugged to our hearts all the Thereses and Isabelles, who would make love to one another later with other names. We rode entwined down a slope of shadows, we held our breath so that life and death should come to a halt. I stormed her mouth as one storms a blithe city, I was hoping to plunder and destroy both her entrails and my own. Isabelle cried in panic. I persevered. Isabelle called for help. Isabelle: I can feeling it climbing my legs, its coming. Therese: Tell me Isabelle: I love you Therese: again Isabelle: I love you Therese: again Isabelle: I love youSo the girls are making out inside, meanwhile outside the chapel, a school teacher/counselor is showing parents around the school and says, " this used to be the chapel, our girls make use of it for dramatics" Hilarious! I also noticed catholic guilt in this scene, where Therese talks about crucifixion with "I nailed her hands against it with palms of mine" after all they were making out on the floor of the chapel!! I think the character of Therese is very bold for exploring masturbation, especially after her first sex encounter, which may have helped her in her self awareness. She seemed more accepting of herself, her situation with her mother and step father and Isabelle. Its very arousing to see it someone finger herself under the sheets, the beauty of the scene is it was portrayed without showing any skin unlike La Vie d'AdeI<U+0080>le (blue is the warmest colour). This movie was written and made way ahead of its time. I wish more people would watch it! 
tt0063683;  the author of the book, by the same title, should not have let her name be used for this movie.  if you have read the book, this movie takes such a liberal interpretation of the actual events in the book and its spirit that the movie and book seem to have quite little in common except the title and some superficial details.  the movie adds nothing, in terms of artistic merit, to the book's own literary achievement.for those who have not read the book:  you will also be disappointed.  not only does the plot move at an incredibly slow pace, it doesn't offer anything more while it is moving slowly (like character development, for example).  some viewers might be entertained by some of the graphic lesbian love scenes later on in the movie, but you might as well watch a showtime special for the stuff they show in therese and isabelle--its fairly tame and not imaginative at all. 
tt0063683;  I'm not sure how related they are, but I'm almost certain that Lost and Delirious is a remake of this movie (or the story that it's based on). Very similar plotline, and even some of the scenes and sets seem to be very, very similar.  Lost & Delirious is actually a much better movie, so see that one instead.This one moves very slowly, but being a late 60s French movie, that is to be expected of the style.  Told in a retrospect from the perspective of one of the girls revisiting the school.  The editing of the flashbacks with the current scenes is a little bit confusing at first, particularly since the audio from each overlaps (ie, hearing flashbacks while seeing the present and vice versa).  Also, the "girls" are a bit old to think that they are in a boarding school.  Finally, not much character development to even get you attached to the movie. 
tt0063683;  You hope for a good film, you get promised a good film, you pay good money for a film, you view film and... oh jeez, its a load of crap!Disappointment #1: Its black and white. My fault.  Read those labels!Disappointment #2: The "girls" are clearly in their late twenties.  Now I really have to work hard to believe this story, but wait...Disappointment #3: There is no story! I won't spend much effort describing how thin the plot (and I use the term loosely) is.  There is no drama.  I expected to see them meet, do things together, friendship deepen, etc.  It doesn't happen.Disappointment #4: Practically no nudity.  If you're not going to provide any cinematic value, at least let me see some pretty, nude women!  Why do you think people would buy this film anyway?  For the record, the women are beautiful, and you do see them naked from the waist up for a few seconds.  Not enough to even make it to the "tease" level.  Stories can be very erotic without explicit graphics if told with style, but such finesse is beyond the range of this director.Summary: A complete disappointment on every level.  
tt0079153; Firepower's history is more interesting than the film itself, since it was originally intended for Clint Eastwood and its production nearly junked by Sir Lew Grade. This ITC actioner began as one of numerous 'Dirty Harry' scripts rejected by Eastwood and was later adjusted to the temperament of Charles Bronson, who backed out during pre-production. Having lost a major box office draw, Grade nearly called things off before he sensed a public relations disaster in the British tabloids and insisted that his film be made. Bronson's role as a top-shelf assassin went to James Coburn, who delivers in this frenetic story co-rewritten and directed by Michael Winner. The physically imposing Coburn joins Sophia Loren, O.J. Simpson, Eli Wallach, and Anthony Franciosa in a top cast who frolic amidst death and destruction in the Caribbean.The plot of 'Firepower' is too complicated to explain here, with many twists and turns that become secondary to its large-scale action. To make a long story short, Coburn plays Jerry Fanon, a former assassin who is called out of retirement by mob boss Sal Hyman (Wallach). Hyman has worked out a deal with U.S. authorities to hire Fanon in exchange for waving his criminal charges. Fanon's job is to capture drug company magnate Karl Stegner (Franciosa), who arranged the murder of a physician after exposing his line of bad pharmaceuticals. Stegner is hiding on the small island of Antigua, living a reclusive life amidst security cameras, attack dogs, bodyguards, and informants. Behind the entire story is Adele Tasca (Loren), the doctor's widow and past lover of Fanon.'Firepower' is not a film that will change your life, but it's one of the most purely entertaining titles I've recently seen. While this film is slow to develop, it takes off after the first 20 minutes with rapidly-paced action sets. The action is chuck-full of explosions, gunfire, and hand-to-hand combat. Coburn, teaming with O.J. Simpson (as fellow hit-man Catlett), uses a level-headedness and physical stature that are ideal for his role. Simpson is also physically and dramatically satisfying in a limited part. While on 'exhibit' for much of the film, Sophia Loren looks as beautiful as ever and keeps a wry sense of humor. Other familiar names make an appearance, including Vincent Gardenia ('Death Wish'), Victor Mature, and middleweight boxing champion Jake LaMotta.This is certainly one of the best films that Michael Winner has made, yet it lacks his unique style. While his cheekiness is felt in the most violent situations, little is seen of the zooms, odd camera angles, and wobbles that are constant in his other movies. Winner is at his best in the action scenes, which are edited by the director under his pen name of Arnold Crust. The storyline eventually plays second fiddle to the action, but this film never loses its edge - like a pulp novel in overdrive.The special effects by Al Griswold ('F/X,' 'Entrapment') and Paul Stewart ('Predator') are antique by today's standards, but were top-of-the line for the late 1970s and much more engaging then the CFI we're nowadays offered. The same outdatedness is found in Gato Barbieri's saxophone-laden score, although his opening theme sets the high-crime mood nicely and is never more conspicuous than it needs to be. Robert Paynter's cinematography appears to be right for the lush scenes in Antigua and CuraA§ao, it would look even better if not for the most recent VHS release.For fans of James Coburn and Sophia Loren (who isn't?), 'Firepower' is a decent hour and 40 minutes of viewing time and worth a couple of dollars if VHS tapes are lying around on the Internet or at garage sales. 'Firepower' is not currently available in DVD format, which is a shame considering the excellent cast and exotic locations. CBS/FOX Video issued an American VHS release in 1983, an absolute massacre of the original studio print. Besides the usual full screen presentation, there is grain and faded colors that are usually found on cheap TV broadcasts. Daytime scenes have washed-out visuals, evening scenes are so dark that one can barely see what's going on. Much of this is owed to the videotape's age, but also the knockoff quality of reproduction by CBS/FOX. Considering that several of Michael Winner's films are now available on DVD, 'Firepower' is long overdue for an update.*** out of 4 
tt0079153;  Michael Winner's films aren't complete without a lot of blood, and this one has enough to fill a bucket or two.James Coburn is the retired hitman who comes back in to kidnap a certain Karl Stegner, a mysterious and very wealthy man wanted by the IRS and various other federal agencies.Coburn teams up mainly with OJ Simpson, with some dubious assistance from Sophia Loren, and we have a 70s high-tech sort of caper. Lots of gadgetry, most of it explosive, large quantities of double-crossing and shooting, plenty of pretty shots of the Caribbean from floating gin palaces, and a plot of such ludicrous over-complexity that it's silly.It was obviously immense fun to make: several very large houses get burned down, bulldozed and otherwise trashed. As do various means of transportation. With lots of explosions and shooting.It's implausible and it's almost impossible to understand why anyone would do what these people do, but apparently this is what they do. Bullets fly and things blow up.There is an awful lot of frenetic activity, constantly accompanied by the sound of gunfire with regular scenes of conflagration.Did I mention that there's a lot of shooting and explosions in this? In case I didn't, there is, as well as a very confusing plot.It's not a very good movie. 
tt0079153; 'Fire Power' is typical of a lot of 70's thrillers which rely more on plot and character than the Jerry Bruckheimer extravaganzas that we get nowadays. In a nutshell, Sophia Loren's husband is murdered because he is a witness to the drug dealings of a powerful drug lord who lives in the Caribbean. Loren suggests that James Coburn, her former lover and bounty hunter, be the man to head down to the Caribbean to catch her husband's murderer. Along the way, there are lots of plot twists and turns- for example, whose side is Loren really on? And indeed, Who is really this mysterious drug lord? Michael Winner was a director of numerous 70's thrillers, most famously with Charles Bronson (The 'Death Wish' films). He is a competent director who was dismissed by critics because his films were overtly violent and straight forward in their execution. The film probably has too many plot twists and characters, with the action changing from the Caribbean to the U.S too often and confusingly. The film is certainly not boring and you do get the glamorous Loren and the always good Coburn on screen together which can't be a bad thing.Overall, a little too ambitious for its own good but if you are a fan of 70's films and thrillers in particular then this one is worth searching for. A Region 1 DVD release will hopefully appear some time in the near future. 
tt0079153; This is a great movie. Now I am not saying that it is perfect but quite enjoyable. Its got great stars and the scenery makes you want to get on a plane for the Caribean. It is clear that the character of Carl Stegner is based to a certain degree on Howard Hughes. Billionaire, reclusive industrialist who has not been seen in years. Traveling at the center of a large entourage, that was Hughes in the 70's. James Coburn is fantastic in this role. He never fails to make the character of Jerry Fannon believable. O.J. Simpson is pretty good too only lapsing unbelievable when waxing nostalgic on the boat with Coburn and Sophia Loren. If anyone is off the mark in this one its Loren. She is great in spots but dos'nt seem to interested at other times. Tony Franciosa brings his usual blow torch intensity to the role. To enjoy Firepower you cannot take it too seriously. Enjoy it for what it is. Great cast full of recognizable faces, beautiful scenery and a fairly good plot. What else does one need? 
tt0079153; Sophia Loren is out for revenge and the FBI wants to get one of the world's richest men who is a Howard Hughes like recluse. This guy put out a hit on her husband who was blown up in a laboratory with a mail bomb. What to do, but call in the FBI in the person of Vincent Gardenia. But getting the Hughes like gazillionaire ain't easy so the FBI calls in a consultation with the Mafia as represented by Eli Wallach. Lots of Firepower will be needed, but even more brains. The best guy for the job is independent contractor James Coburn who sets out to storm the rich guy's fortress on Antigua.The nice Caribbean location and the chance to see a few movie names are the only reason to see this ridiculous action thriller. Both Clint Eastwood and Charles Bronson turned this one down and poor James Coburn was left holding the bag. Bronson, who worked with director Michael Winner on any number of projects, left this cold, so you know he was hearing the faint sounds of Thanksgiving.Even Anthony Franciosa, one of the most underrated players ever, looks ridiculous in this as the doctor feel good to the rich and reclusive. Add to that Billy Barty as a midget mob boss and you get the idea how ridiculous this one is.Unless you like all the stars like I do and want to see O.J. Simpson get what's coming to him, stay away from Firepower. 
tt0079153;  Forgettable time-waster, without purpose or meaning. It proves that even a few wild car chases and large-scale explosions can't sustain a desperately uninteresting and uninvolving story. The large cast is largely underused. (*1/2) 
tt0079153;  This bomb shows that no number of recognizable stars or presumed acting talents can salvage a film constructed with a laughable script, grade- school directing, second-rate sound effects, and a plot with no credibility whatsoever. Spoiler -  the last scene with an over-the-hill Victor Mature looking as greasy as ever in a ten second cameo no doubt had every unfortunate viewer reaching for the sickness bag. 
tt0095900; Okay, so we've got Roberta Findlay ("Tenement: Game of Survival", "Snuff") directing a cheesy 80's horror movie revolving on a brotherhood of devilish monks sacrificing young women to Satan himself and drinking their blood in order to remain immortal. How bad could this possibly be? Correction, it's unquestionably going to be extremely bad, but the right question to ask should be: How is this not going to be entertaining? What we have here is pure late-80's trash-gold, with a completely nonsensical and laughably incoherent plot, tacky make-up effects, gratuitous nudity and a whole lot of gibberish about Our Lord Satan! The script of "Prime Evil" is wonderfully incompetent and aimlessly skips from one theme onto the other without any form of continuity. The film opens in the year thirteen-hundred-forty something with a bunch of monks turning to Satanism because they're angry with God for allowing the Black Plague to kill millions of people. This was obviously a brilliant career move because the story suddenly jumps forward in time 600 years and all the monks contained their same age and virility. But the next winter sacrifice is coming up and one of the cult members suggests using his granddaughter because she's still a virgin. Meanwhile, the leader of the cult engaged a convicted killer to randomly kidnap the granddaughter's best friends and then Â<U+0096> finally Â<U+0096> there's also a sub plot about a devoted nun going undercover in the cult by order of the Catholic Church. This last sub plot is actually the most hilarious, since Sister Angela is hardly ever mentioned anymore after her initiation rites. This is why I personally love 80's horror movies! There are so many ideas yet they all just loosely connect together. There's no atmosphere of suspense whatsoever and even the whole devil-worshiping concept seems redundant. They're just a posse of bloodthirsty priests craving to cut open voluptuous young girls. There's fairly little gore until the climax arrives and that reddish puppet with horns, supposedly representing Lucifer, is just plain pitiable. The acting performances are horrible, but I don't suppose you expected it any other way. Boring, however, it was not. 
tt0095900;  A group of evil monks surface in New York City sacrificing humans left and right to Lord Satan.Fortunately,a brave and determined nun infiltrates the sect in an attempt to stop the immortals' demonic sacrifices."Prime Evil" is truly horrible.The action is very dull and the acting is bad.The gore effects made by Ed French are occasionally pretty effective and gruesome.Still the film is horribly boring,so don't waste your time with this one! 
tt0095900; I'm somewhat surprised by the bad reviews here, only in that I would GUESS someone who took the time to WATCH "Prime Evil" might well LIKE "Prime Evil." But there you go.I think the film is somewhat better than that. Findley's film is clearly meant to be absurd and is mostly played for laughs. A good portion, if not all, of the silly humor works. William Beckwith is certainly game as a the head bad guy, and Christine Moore is a winning presence who helps you hang in there to the end. Therein lies the problem, the film wears out it's welcome by about half an hour, and the comic cops who bring up the rear are more tiresome than amusing. Maybe Findley though She needed a lot of padding between the knockers and stage blood, but the film overplays it's hand. Again, a lot of this plays like a parody of the devil worshiping cult film that goes way back to "The Black Cat", and if your into this kind of stuff at all you might enjoy "Prime Evil." 
tt0095900; Evil monks search New York City in the late 1980's for virgin sacrifices. Muddled movie by Roberta Findlay appears to have been shot about the same time as her film Lurkers since it has many of the same locations and much of the same casts. From the stand point of having some scenes of old New York this is good, but from any other stand point this really isn't worth your time. The problem is that the film's script isn't all that good. Its a stitched together affair with plot points from other films dropped in. The result is a kind of boredom that comes from a film that seems to have been made more for the money then it was for the love or need to make it. More dull then anything else it never generates enough interest to create any real scares because you really don't care. Watchable in a bad movie sort of way, its the sort of thing that is best seen only when going through a multiple film set since its not worth the time or the effort to see a film like this as a stand alone. 
tt0095900; A nasty sect of evil monks led by the sinister Father Thomas Seaton (dreadfully overplayed with shameless eye-rolling hammy brio by William Beckwith) sacrifice virgins every thirteen years in order to appease Lucifer and remain immortal for perpetuity. The sect plans on carving up sweet, but repressed goody-goody two shoes social worker Alexandra Parkman (the singularly woeful Christine Moore) on the altar. Brave nun Sister Angela (a hopelessly dire performance by Mavis Harris) infiltrates the cult so she can put a stop to these foul heathens once and for all. Misdirected with alarming ineptitude by Roberta Findley (who also did the surprisingly passable cinematography), with a hackneyed script by Ed Kelleher and Hariette Vidal (for example, the devil worshipers are your standard bunch of creepy folks in black hoods and robes chanting wicked incantations), a poky pace, a generic ooga-booga shivery and ominous score by Walter E. Sear, clunky dialogue ("He's not breathing, he wouldn't talk to me. My guess is he's dead"), a few clumsily staged fight scenes, a generous sprinkling of tasty gratuitous female nudity, and a last reel appearance by a laughably hokey rubbery puppet Satan, this admittedly lousy, yet still oddly entertaining tripe certainly possesses the right wrong stuff to rate as an amusingly awful clunker. The lame no-name cast all fail to impress with their uniformly atrocious acting, with top thespic dishonors going to Max Jacobs as Alexandra's scheming, diabolical grandfather George Parkman, the ever-foxy Ruth Collins as reformed junkie Cathy, Tim Gail as Alexandra's stolid assistant college professor fiancA© Bill King, George Krause as hulking psycho lackey Ben, Amy Brentano as Alexandra's ditsy gal pal Brett, Jeanne Marie as bitter foul-mouthed teenage hooker Judy, and Gary Warner as drippy Detective Dann Carr. Ed French provides some nifty gore and gnarly make-up f/x. A deliciously cruddy Grade Z hoot. 
tt0095900; Okay yes, it's not good. But if you really give it a fair shot, it had some decent ideas behind it. The motivation for the villains is acceptable, the acting ranges from horrible to surprisingly decent, and the plot isn't half bad believe it or not. I think the disappointing thing about this movie is that it could have been pretty good, not great, but good if in the hands of a capable director.Is it bad? YES, but it seems to stand out among the other exploitation schlock for some reason (granted it is exploitation schlock). I can't believe I'm writing this, but this movie begs for a remake, in an era where production companies insist on taking good nostalgic horror movies and making them mediocre, they should take a mediocre movie with decent ideas like this and make it, well, good.If you can find this, check it out, just don't pay to much to see it, and maybe you'll agree with me. 
tt0095900; Prime Evil tells of a satanic cult whose members can achieve immortality and invulnerability through the regular sacrifice of blood relatives to a hideous demon (that is about two foot tall and seems to be made of red rubber). Aged acolyte George Parkman (Max Jacobs) intends to prolong his powers for another thirteen years by taking the life of his virginal grand-daughter Alex (Christine Moore), and then wrest control of the cult from sinister leader Thomas Seaton (William Beckwith), but with Alex's boyfriend Bill King (Tim Gail) becoming increasingly suspicious of George, will the old man's wicked plans succeed?After spending the 70s producing and directing porn, Roberta Findlay had a brief career making horror films, but in my opinion, it wasn't brief enough: a few months ago, I watched her horrendous '87 whorehouse horror Blood Sisters, and last night, against my better judgement, I checked out Prime Evil, and all the evidence so far suggests that the woman should have stayed in the 'bump and grind' business.Findlay simply doesn't possess the fundamental skill set necessary to make a decent non-porn movie, her usual objective being to capture a juicy extreme close-up rather than to present a coherent story or obtain credible (non-sexual) performances from her actors (not that anyone from her dreadful cast looks capable of such an undertaking). A poorly developed script full of diabolical dialogue and precious little action doesn't help matters, of course, and with Findlay's visuals having that distinct porno quality (an effect helped no end by regular nudity from some suspiciously low-rent bimbos), the result is a nasty looking and amateurish yawn-fest that, although not quite as terrible as Blood Sisters, is still a chore to sit through.3.5 out of 10, rounded up to 4 for the topless tarts, the rubbish demon and a laughable decapitation. 
tt0095900; Directed by Roberta Findlay Prime Evil is a straight to VHS abomination that is plagued by such a weak plot and bi-polar performances by the two leads, the walking dead Alexandra (Christine Moore) and the smarmy Thomas Seaton (William Beckwith), that you quickly realize why this was never released in theaters.In 1349 a group of monks led by Brother Seaton denounce God for bringing the black death on to them and pledge allegiance to Satan. The pact comes with a price as the monks must sacrifice a blood relative every 13 years in order to remain immortal. Flash forward to modern day New England where the monks are alive and well and will apparently accept anyone into the fold including homicidal janitors. George Parkman's 13 year duty has arrived and promises to sacrifice his granddaughter Alexandra who was sold into child pornography by her father when she was six years old. Charming. This particular scenario pleases Father Seaton in such an oh so evil way that he replies, "Remember you get extra points if she's a virgin". I can't see Old Scratch himself devising a bonus point plan for his followers. What do you get with these bonus points? Longer life? More power? A free tank of gas? A side plot is thrown into the first fifteen minutes as a nun Angela volunteers to go undercover in order to expose the evil order. Her initiation consists of smashing ceramics and a change of wardrobe. Voila! Instant satanist! She doesn't factor in the movie again until the end. Alexandra soon becomes smitten with Father Seaton much to the consternation of her boyfriend Bill. When every person Alexandra has ever known mysteriously die her date with the devil arrives. Or at least date with the most evil muppet ever.William Beckwith's performance as Thomas Seaton must have been the inspiration for Mike Myers's Dr. Evil. Every syllable he utters is dripping with "I'm so eeeeeeeeeevil". His character is more appropriate for an episode of Batman rather than late eighties horror. Christine Moore and her dopey Canadian accent sleepwalks the whole way as the utterly clueless Alexandra. The ending is on par with any junior high level production only with Prime Evil you don't have the benefit of missing algebra class. Rumor has it Satan himself denied any involvement in the movie and blamed it on his brother Beelzebub. 
tt0095900; I watched this as one of the movies in Rhino's Horrible Horrors Vol. 1 box set. While it wasn't entirely horrible, it was pretty poor.It starts off with some narration (which is absent for the rest of the movie), and a scene of a monk turning Satanist in the 1300s or something like that. Then in the present day, the death of a priest who was secretly a Satanist prompts a nun to go undercover to try to infiltrate the Satanists. She isn't given much to do for most of the movie, though.There's a young woman who had been abused by her father and a group of child pornographers who plans to get married. Apart from the sexual abuse as a child, she's never had sex. Her grandfather is one of the Satanists and plans to use her in a sacrifice. He would like to take over the group.There's also the Satanist's goon, who goes about like a slasher killing some people, abducting others. The cinematography and editing and so on aren't incompetent, but the acting and story are pretty lifeless. Surprisingly, there's no nudity. There's not a whole lot of blood, but there is some, and towards the end some people rapidly age or melt, I'm not sure. 
tt0095900; I got this movie in a collection of about twelve movies called "Gorehouse Greats". Funny thing is of the ones I have watched in it have been not all that gory. This one is also not all that gory, there is blood and lots of booby shots, but not a whole lot of gore. This one has a sect of devil worshipers living in modern day New York (at least I think it was New York). They perform sacrifices of blood relatives to Satan to stay nice and young, and they get bonus points if they are female and virgins. Meanwhile, a strange handyman is given a list and the next thing you know he is attacking a woman and her lover who is a rather clumsy kick boxer. Dude seems to knock out the handyman until the handyman teleports behind the dude and stabs him dead, then proceeds to kidnap the blond who offered no help during the scuffle. At this point the only thing worth seeing in the movie was the blond's boobs, and that is the theme of the movie. Boobs to see, not much plot to watch. I mean they show a sacrifice of a supposed virgin at the beginning of the film and it is supposedly the one guy's daughter, but she looked old enough to be the guys sister or something. Then a main gal's mother looks like she could be an older sister. Then a gal gets arrested for street walking and is said to be underage, if so being under 30 in New York must be underage. Then there is the boyfriend who raises objections over a certain priest as he kind of gets fresh with the main girl and it is obvious and the girl keeps going "Don't attack him" and stuff, though if I were the boyfriend I would have dumped the gal when she told me why she was hesitant about having sex as she had a bit to much baggage. I know it sounds kind of mean of me, but females dump men for being insecure and more inane reasons than what she had. If this review seems to be skipping around a bit I am just trying to be like the movie. You also have an undercover nun and two cops that looked like they were straight out of that Beastie Boys video Sabotage. So an all around bad effort, but they give you some boobs to look at and great lines like "Don't you wanna get poked?". I am not joking that line is in the film. 
tt0084869;  After the sordid delights of 'SS Camp 5 - Womans' Hell' and the bleakly disturbing 'Womans' Camp 119', Bruno Mattei says farewell Nazis and, plumps instead, for a bunch of jailbirds for his next 'women incarcerated' chunk of sleaze.It is unfortunate I didn't have a copy of 'Blade Violent' to compare this with, this film used the same cast,same sets and virtually same plot. A plus point is that I can review this purely on single merit. On a whole this is a fairly average entry in the Women In Prison genre, featuring three scream queens Gemser, Stoppi and De Selle taking the main roles. Unfortunately these stalwarts of sin cannot save this movie from being a little mundane. The movie tells the tale of our intrepid reporter Emanuelle (Gemser)undercover in a female penitentiary as an inmate. Her task is to report on the corruptive and inhumane practices within the prison/penal system. Eventually we are thrust into the unsavoury W.I.P world where beatings are regularly brandished out by deadpan officers with bad hair, sapphic shennanigans are occurring regularly by the suitably looking 'rough' females and there is of course the obligatory humiliation, mental and physical.I am unsure whether it is because this is Matteis' first stab at the W.I.P genre (though SS films can't be all that dissimilar surely ?) but I feel the whole movie is rather a tame effort. There a few nasty surprises that borderline on the humourous such as the 'poo punch-up' and a very novel way of bell ringing. The rape sequence, although voyeuristically unsettling to begin with, you gradually find yourself amused as two inmates play pass the parcel with a scantily clad virgin most of this sequence and you wonder in disbelief whether this will end or not.The direction is well achieved as Mattei uses commendable editing, although the sets are basic, there is still an oppressive decay to the whole affair. Most of Matteis genre films 'Zombie Creeping Flesh','Rats,Night Of Terror','Womens Camp 119' seem to have this vein of industrial atrophy, clinical but chemical and it is this polluted environment that always is the backdrop to some of Matteis' movies making them seem 'nasty'. Despite sniggering at the dialogue, cringing at the effects and laughing at the dire continuity you always sense a stagnancy that sets the tone from the first frame and lingers throughout until the very last credit. I appreciate Mattei as a director for his grim 'simplicity' and his matter of fact 'I-made-the-films-because-thats-where-the-money-was' attitude. I often think Mattei could've moved onto bigger things but on occasions has been incorrectly underrated. Buy this to add to the Emanuelle collection, The Mattei collection or WIP Collection that may grace the living room shelf. VIEWED, UNCUT UNRATED R1 DISC - 99 MINUTES   
tt0084869; ***WARNING! SPOILERS!*** I was kinda looking forward to this film, simply due to the fact that I am a great fan of the ravishing Exploitation goddess Laura Gemser. This is another entry to the popular "Black Emanuelle" series in which Gemser played the part of the nymphomaniac journalist Emanuelle. This is only the second film in the series I've seen so far, the other being the ultra-sleazy and vastly entertaining "Emanuelle And The Last Cannibals". This "Violenza In Un Carcere Femminile" is sadly not nearly as vastly entertaining, and basically a formula WIP (Women In Prison) flick, and not a good one I must say. The film is not really boring, but it lacks anything to make it specifically recommendable, other than Laura Gemser's several nude scenes (which doesn't make the film particularly memorable either, as she did nude scenes in every movie she was in). Emanuelle comes to a Women's prison this time in order to investigate corruption and abuse of the inmates. Not too surprisingly, both things take place at the institution...I expected the film to be extremely sleazy and exploitative, and it certainly is no Disney flick. It is genre-typically sleazy and full of the usual ingredients (sadistic lesbian wardens, sardonic punishments, catfights,...). There is also one extremely nasty sequence involving rats. It also adds some unnecessary elements (such as some scenes in a men's prison which is right next to the woman's prison) which only make the film longer. What really disappointed me was the ending. In the end WIP flicks the inmates usually take bloody revenge on their tormentors. They partly do here, too, but the two main bad guys (a male and a female warden) only get arrested. Not an adequate ending, in my opinion. This was directed by Bruno Mattei who (along with his protegA© and assistant director Claudio Fragasso)is responsible for some of the worst films the generally great Italian Horror/Exploitation cinema has ever brought forth. While this "Violenza In Un Carcere Femminile" is not a terrible film, it is pretty damn tedious at times. Worthwhile for the sleaze and especially for Laura Gemser, but certainly not highly recommendable. Take it or leave it. 
tt0084869; The reporter Emanuelle (Laura Gemser) is on an undercover mission in a prison. If you ever watched any of the women-in-prison movies of the 1980s, you know: prisoners are not treated kindly there. However, "Violenza..." is a little bit superior to most of this genre insofar as it is not only into shower scenes. It's a tough, dark, fast moving flick with an amazing Laura Gemser and her husband Gabriele Tinti as a doctor who helps her to escape. The slowly evolving love interest between the doctor and Emanuelle is well scripted. Not for the fainthearted, however, is a scene where Emanuelle is locked up in a dark cell with a bunch of rats attacking her. Two years later, director Bruno Mattei went on to shoot "Rats - Notte di Terrore" with many more rats - a kind of unhealthy fascination, if you ask me. Laura Gemser and Gabriele Tinti continued with another prison movie "I Violenti" which is a sequel (not as good as the first film) to "Violenza..." although Tinti plays a different character. 
tt0084869;  I've seen my fair share of poor women in prison films (including Mattei's Women's Prison Massacre), and I can safely say Caged Women is definitely one of the better ones.Basically Caged Women is exactly the same as Women's Prison Massacre except it loads more fun!  It's got basically the same plot, and same actors/actresses, but Caged Women is much more action packed and better paced.  It was a bit more off-the-wall which is why I probably liked it so much.  The 'rat attack' scene came out of nowhere.This WiP flick has basically all the usual plot elements needed to make a film of this stature - nudity, sex, sadism, nudity, blood, lesbianism, sex, torture, sex, sex.... get the idea?It's a fun exploitative film.  You couldn't do worse, could you?  
tt0084869; One great thing about Italian filmmakers back in the day was their guts. Unlike a lot of North American filmmakers, they weren't afraid to push the envelope. Not that this is always a good thing, but a lot of times the result was golden. One of the most controversial sub-genres of film is 'Women in Prison.' A number of them have been made over here, but not like in Italy. This film, the first of two WIP flicks by late schlockmeister Bruno Mattei, is one of the better examples.Pros: Better than expected performances. Great score. Nice cinematography. Lots of campy goods. Paces movies along once it picks up. Has a gritty realism. Several memorable fight scenes.Cons: Virtually plot less. First 20 minutes are tedious. Some dubbing not in sync with actor's mouths. Not much distinguishing this from other WIP films.Final thoughts: Once again, Bruno Mattei does not disappoint. His films are not great cinematic achievements, but boy do they entertain. This one isn't for all tastes, but is a must see for fans of his and the Women in Prison sub-genre. Having cult icon Laura Gemser in the female lead only makes it sweeter.My rating: 3.5/5 
tt0084869;  Spoilers ahead....Yes this movie is awesome. One of the better women's prison flicks for sure. A female reporter fakes a criminal record and dives head first into the brutal prison system. She gets raped, bitten bad by rats, beaten, whipped, and just plain tortured!!!Good movie for sure with lots and lots of female on female sex. This movie was also filmed in Rome which makes it unique. If you like female prison exploitation flicks this is a must see. Slasher reviewer, although this is not a slasher movie, gives this masterpiece a big thumbs up!!!!Check it out you won't be disappointed!!  
tt0084869;  its true,  not just anyone can! . why are they certain trashy exploitation movies we hold dear? Mattei did bring style/substance to his films. Watch "Violenza in un carcere femminile" There is a dark mood to this film--done by style of cinematography, the score, the right cast, great flesh, script and direction. And by the way, cheese was intentional!! I really believe this. God I love this movie, I think I'll watch it tonight. I like "women's camp 119" and "Night of the Zombies" aka Virus for the same reasons but "SS girls" is my favorite. Those who do not believe Mattei Cheesiness was not intentional should see this. In fact all of you who have not seen this film,  should. It may be his masterpiece.
tt0084869;  Violenza in un carcere femminile (Caged Women) is your typical women in prison flick. Laura Gemster, the star of the popular "Emanuelle" series, poses as an undercover journalist trying to find out how hideous the conditions are inside. This film is a bit sleazy and dark at times. Laura Gemster is well known for the sleazy roles she playes in the (Italian) "Emanuelle" films. There are a couple of lesbian scenes but, nothing to shout about. These scenes do not include Laura Gemster. All being said, this film is just average in my opinion. 
tt0084869;  WIP title conceals an entry in the "Black Emanuelle" series. Journalist Em (Laura Gemser, of course) goes undercover at a women's prison to get copy for an exposA©. Naturally the place is a hellhole. Gemser bares her skinny body a few times, has sex scene with Gabriele Tinti (what a surprise), dumps a bucket of feces on a guard and spends time in the hole for it, where she is rather unconvincingly chewed on by hungry rats.Standout inmates here are a haystack hair blonde of about 30, a little overweight but it sure looks good on her, who does a lesbian exhibition to entertain a femme guard, and a tall skinny teenish brunette who is stripped and manhandled by a couple of male guards while Lorraine de Selle, in hooker undies, voyeurs from her boudoir and gets groped by her own b.f. I don't ID either of these inmates but would not mind seeing more of their work. Dubbing is so-so and tech credits about average for an Italian Poverty Row production. This seems to have an authentic US R-rating so is probably a somewhat abridged version of the original. I saw this on big screen in the early 80s and later added a copy to my own video library but it's still just a modest entry in the WIP sweepstakes. 
tt0084869;  Bruno Mattei's "Violence in a Women's Prison" is an enjoyable exploitation film.Laura Gemser plays a reporter named Emanuelle,who is going under cover to investigate reports of brutality and abuse of the inmates.She is exposed to beatings,forced sexual encounters,being chewed on by rats etc.The film has plenty of nudity and violence,but there is not enough sleazy exploitation for my liking.Mattei's obscure "Nerone e Poppea"(1983)is certainly more nasty and gore laden.Still the cast is pretty familiar for fans of Italian horror with Laura Gemser,Gabriele Tinti,Lorraine de Selle,Carlo de Mejo and Franca Stoppi to boost.So if you like WIP movies you can't go wrong with this one.7 out of 10. 
tt0100661; Get hold of this film, any way you can (not illegally, of course). Scream its name from the rooftops of buildings everywhere, high or small, and offer prayers to your God for a fully-featured special edition DVD release. There is no film like Sonny Boy: even Leonard Maltin was moved to call it (I quote verbatim) "A repulsive, socially irredeemable waste of celluloid ... filmed for no apparent reason other to offend and appal", and if that isn't a recommendation for a cult movie, I don't know what is. Critics said similar things about Peeping Tom, A Clockwork Orange, Reservoir Dogs, and so many more ... those films are amazing and entirely individual, and so is this. It's pitiful that Sonny Boy has so little recognition apart from a few right-thinking die hards - you don't have to like it, just admit you've never seen its like before or since. Get on the bandwagon speedily, because if I am human this film will, in the near future, be recognised for the angry, iconoclastic, unclassifiable explosion it really is. And you can be among those who educated the world. Feel the adrenaline. There. 
tt0100661;  While watching this with a friend (in a general state of disbelief due to the surreal audacity of the flick), they looked over at me to exclaim that I had found "the impossible movie".  This comment bluntly yet accurately summarizes in many ways what it is about this movie that cannot really be put into words.  Any attempt to describe this movie would simply do it an injustice.  The combination of elements, cinematography, music, actors, scenarios, etc. is nearly brilliant and the dark humored tone that dominates this film is disturbing, illuminating and hilarious all at once.  Watching this film is definitely a love-it or hate-it proposition, but for those who appreciate the surreal, offbeat and macabre elements of cinema, this film is a motherlode.  Just keep in mind that Psychotronic Film Guide ranks this as one of the top ten films of the '80's and the gentleman responsible for the screenplay (Graeme Whifler) created most of the early films and videos for that infamous band of San Francisco musical luminaries, The Residents.  If these two facts mean anything to you, then I need to say no more... 
tt0100661;  Sonny Boy is a one of a kind horror/comedy with an exceptional cast. Paul L. Smith (Midnight Express, Crimewave) plays his usual over-the-top man/monster role, David Carradine his transvestite wife, Brad Dourif (legend!) the aptly named Weasel, and Dourif's Cuckoo's Nest co-star Sydney Lassick, the slimy Charlie P. Michael Griffin is exceptional in the title role. Pity he didn't go on to do anything else. Maybe making Sonny Boy scarred him for life?! I also liked veteran Conrad Janis as one of the few non-repulsive characters in this, an alcoholic doctor with a liking for surgery involving monkey parts(!) Janis has had one eclectic career, working with everyone from Shirley Temple and Ronald Reagan to African bushman N!xau, from Mork And Mindy to The Cable Guy, but surely he must rate this as the weirdest project he's ever been involved in! And Brad Dourif has made more than his fair share of strange movies,not least of which Blue Velvet, but none as demented as this crazy mutha!I recommend Sonny Boy to bizarre movie lovers everywhere, and fans of Garth Ennis comics will find much to enjoy here, as it shares a similar gonzo humour to Preacher et al. 
tt0100661; Terminally weird indie film with Paul L. Smith playing Slue, a small town crime boss. David Carradine plays his transvestite (I think) squeeze, Pearl, while Brad Dourif and Sydney Lassick are his two henchmen, Weasel and Charlie P. Weasel kills a couple and steals their car, which he brings to Slue. He didn't realize, however, that the couple's baby was asleep in the back. Slue wants to feed the kid to the hogs, but Pearl sees him as the son he could never have. They raise him as a killer to be used against Slue's enemies. They also cut out his tongue as a birthday present?! When Sonny Boy gets loose, his actions threaten to turn the town against Slue.I had wanted to see this one after reading about it in "Terror on Tape", and TCM gave me the chance when they aired it as part of their Underground lineup. As you can plainly see from the plot description, it's certainly offbeat. Sort of an allegory in disguise for the effects of child abuse, you might expect this to be a disturbing film. Not even close. Instead, it's just strange. Slue has an old canon, and in a wicked scene, he uses it to blow apart a nosy deputy. There are also some obvious parallels to Frankenstein towards the end. Had I not known it beforehand, I would have been shocked to see that this was released in '89. It felt like something straight out of the 70's. The main giveaway was the computer font which tells how much time had passed. While I would hesitate to call "Sonny Boy" a good film, it's worth a look if only to say that you've seen it. For fans of bizarre cinema, there's enough of a novelty present to warrant at least one viewing. Personally, I'm still not 100% sure if Carradine was supposed to be playing a guy in drag or an actual woman. 
tt0100661; I have to agree with all those who sing this film's praises. If you really think about it, this was the last truly independent film to be released on American screens. (I'm not talking about today's so-called "indie" films that are pushed into theatres by giant corporations like Miramax and Lion's Gate and Fox Searchlight, but movies that were peddled by independent distributors the old fashioned way.) I'm proud to say I saw it twice on the big screen: the first time, I was the only person in the theatre, the second time I brought a friend I knew would appreciate it and it was only the two of us! I also proudly own the ultra-rare laser disc. It really needs a DVD release, which ideally would have commentaries revealing more about this wonderful work. 
tt0100661; When I read Leonard Maltin's review of this film (which I'd never heard of), I was instantly intrigued. After all, who doesn't want to see a film starring Brad Douriff, David Carradine, and the guy who played Bluto in Popeye which, according to Maltin, "was filmed for no apparent reason but to offend and appall?" When I finally tracked it down via a bootleg site years later, I was expecting an unredeemable gorefest, but instead, I got a quirky, sensitive, sorta moving flick about child abuse...kind of. I mean, it ain't The English Patient--it's got a deputy getting exploderated at point blank range with a Howitzer and a cigar-chomping David Carradine in full drag (one of his best performances, by the way. Utterly believable--and he even sings the theme song!), but it works more as a drama than an exploitation flick. Some budgetary constraints show, particularly in a mostly offscreen Frankensteinish angry mob scene, but I wasn't disappointed, despite the fact that I was expecting a horror gore comedy and got an offbeat indie dramedy. Someday, this truly unique flick will be a cult classic. Watch it now and say you saw it first. (By the way, I got my copy at Nightcrew Video, a great bootleg site.) 
tt0100661; This is one of the most ignored and genuinely horrific horror films I've seen, and I consider myself a connoisseur of these type of films...This ranks with Irreversible, I Spit on Your Grave, Last House on the Left, Hostel etc for pure nauseous shock - a child's tongue is cut out by his perverted 'parents' as a birthday present which is utterly normal in the context of the film...Forget Texas Chainsaw Massacre or The Hills Have Eyes - this is real US horror, like The Girl Next Door (though not that shocking).Utterly nihilistic, very strange and well worth a look if you can find it! 
tt0100661;  If you're expecting this to be just a cheap, ugly exploitation film, you may actually be surprised. Although it does border on the offensive, and Paul L. Smith plays (convincingly) one of the most repugnant characters you'll ever see, the film has enough originality and audacity to be preferable to many other formula horror outings. The script develops into a variation on the "Frankenstein" myth, and the terrific music score gives a poetic dimension to some scenes. Outstanding performance by the actor who plays Sonny Boy. (**) 
tt0100661; Strange...Dark...Compelling. Very good and original performances by the entire cast who seemed to have embraced this definitely 'cult' style film, as a mother Swan might embrace the ugliest duckling in the pond. Caradine gives a brave, toothless, transvestite 'Mother of the Year' award performance against his/her demoniacal husband's (Paul Smith's)lumbering, grotesque, almost cartoonish 'Big Daddy' gone mad act. Brad Douriff as one of the 'baddies' manages to re-invent four letter words after every syllable in a suitably frightening manner, while Conrad Janis, in the role of 'Doc', a quasi 'Mad Scientist---with a heart of gold', sporting a Raider's of the Lost Ark hat and a ten day beard amazingly manages to imbue some of the strangest dialogue ever uttered by an actor, with depth, heart and compassion, and yes, credibility, as the erstwhile, and reluctant Saviour of the poor mistreated, mutilated 'Sonny Boy'. Obviously a bravura directorial hand guided this disturbing yet quixotic film, and Robert Martin Carroll wove this brooding dark magic carpet into a flight not of fancy but of the stuff nightmares are made of. 
tt0100661;  This movie is a one of a kind. Dark comedy is the best way to describe it. Definitely worth seeing (if just to see David Carradine wearing a dress, though it has much more to offer). The guy from Midnight Express plays another ruthless character in top form.  
tt0076760; I have to agree with the people who say this movie's bad, but disagree with the ones who say it isn't so bad it's good. This movie is completely hilarious! I can only hope warner pulled SI out of distribution because they're working on a 30th anniversary DVD edition with lots of making-of featurettes where the director details how much crack he was on while he was making it. (It's out of circulation now and amazingly it's going for 150 bucks on amazon, this movie. Fortunately my video store happens to have an old copy.) Wait till you see the part with the pocket calculator! In this movie a guy uses a 70s style pocket calculator to compute flightpaths for a flying saucer. I rather would have thought that interplanetary trajectories would be a bit complicated for a pocket calculator, but what do I know? I remember when SI came out pocket calculators were a huge fad, along with digital watches. Everybody was all, now we can finally achieve world peace, because there are pocket calculators.And the overacting family in the huge car! "look! it's a flying saucer! For god's sake DON'T MAKE THEM ANGRY!!" And the robots who look like trash cans...And the sadistic kid who squashes the tomato...Believe it or not I remember seeing this thing 29 years ago when it came out. I was all, wow, that really sucked, mommy. And my mom was like, yeah, I don't know what to tell you. So hilariously stupid and trashy. it's got goofy flying saucers, lots and lots of cheesecake, christopher lee losing every scrap of his dignity, tons of mind-controlled people acting really zombified and stupid, space battles that look like they were lifted straight out of "mars attacks!", possibly the most ridiculous costumes of all time, and the real coup de grace -- one actually extraordinarily talented actress (Helen Shaver, the wife of the UFO researcher guy) caught in the middle of it all, trying valiantly to salvage this whole mess. oh, and the soundtrack kicks. and yet is completely inappropriate for the subject matter.I know, I know, you probably didn't find this review helpful. 
tt0076760; I saw this movie in the same year that "Star Wars" came out and I still liked it. Granted, it's no "Star Wars," but the kid in me loved U.F.O.'s and after all, this was the 70's. U.F.O.'s were a hot topic back then, so it's no surprise that this movie came out during the hype (there were some horrendous movies out around that time). Robert Vaughn, one of my favorite actors, turned a so-so scientist role into a pleasant success. His dry wit is always fun to watch, no matter what movie he's in. In the film, he adds a much-needed human perspective on the alien invaders and performs his role with a touch of class. He knew he was in a low budget movie, but he doesn't act like it, which is a credit to him. Then you add Christopher Lee, one of the greatest villains of all time, and you have a great viewing experience. No other actor could wear that outfit and keep a straight face, but Lee pulls it off. I still remember the pulp-style robots (like Robbie) and spaceships from this movie. They were unique in their design and the effects were better than most 70's movies. If you want to see a fun "popcorn movie" that you can enjoy with your buddies, then this is the one for you. You'll laugh in some places (cringe in others), but it's a great throwback to a time when sci-fi had almost been forgotten. It's definitely campy, but it's a lot of fun to poke fun at those things. Don't go in expecting a blockbuster, but go into this film with an open mind and enjoy it for what it is. Nearly 30 years later, I still enjoy it. 
tt0076760; While there's no denying the poor production value and cheap special effects (this is a B movie, after all), I feel the story behind this movie has some value. The motivation of the bad guys is well established. They are not simply evil, but are in a bit of a tight spot themselves. Also, the primary method they use to achieve their goal (a suicide ray) is rather chilling. The use of telepathic communication between the aliens was a nice touch. The cheesiness of this film can easily be embraced as enjoyable camp. It's not a great film, but I think you'll find that it sticks with you after you watch it. The story is fairly rich, with lots of details and connections filled in along the way. It truly has some meat to it. I first saw it as a kid while growing up. Now, over 25 years later, I finally tracked it down and watched it again. I'm still charmed by it. 
tt0076760;  For years I had hoped to run across this film again as I find that certain images of the flying saucers have stuck in my imagination throughout my adult life. Actual recollections of storyline are nil as it seemed to be crude in its storytelling but my impression is that for whatever reason I believe this to be an important film in terms of its longterm effect on the impressionable minds (like mine at the time) who watched it on its release. Robert Vaughn who so memorably appeared in other low budget films (notably Teenage Caveman, a Corman classic), adds to the overall impression that here was something to be enjoyed throughout ones life. Despite its obvious flaws, you should overlook the films limitations and enjoy the fact that here is a film that at its core is about flying saucers. Apart from Forbidden Planet, no other film has remained with me with such a powerful grip on my imagination. 
tt0076760; HI,Practically every thing in the movie was taken from UFO encounters of some sort reported through the previous years.Whether it was the type of uniform, the insignia, the concept of guardians, the type and location (somewhat) of the base, etc. you get the idea, was made to resemble UFO contact reported information.For me the most catching part of the movie was when one of the robots said "I think I can." when responding to a request for assistance from a guardian vessel under attack.It came out shortly after one of the star wars movies and was labeled in the press as a "star wars" ripoff wannabe. 
tt0076760;  I remember seeing this during Passover Holidays (easter) at my local cinema. It was marketed as a 'Star Wars' knock-off. I picked it up 20 years later in a 2nd hand bin on VHS. THIS FILM IS HILARIOUS DRECK!! Basically this race of aliens try to take over the Earth by mind control by causing earthlings to commit suicide!! Mixing UFO nonsense with ludicrous 'Star Wars' mythology and some demented ideas, I will never forget sitting in a cinema full of teens and pre-teens, and watching in horror as the main actress has her mind controlled, and she proceeds to slash her wrists! Kids were screaming in horror, and the projectionist had to stop the film!! It was truly one of those classic cinema experiences that people just don't experience in today's disgusting cineplex wasteland! 
tt0076760;  A film with some great special effects shots and a few not so great. A film with neat ideas yet, crisp film cinematography and color. This is one of those popcorn and coke matinee films which i saw a zillion times when it ran on WGN and WKBD in syndication. The film features well known actors. In another version i thought I read CHRISTOPHER LEE says his lines. There may have been another version. STARSHIP INVASIONS came out as a "b" movie yet garnered a cult following on tv. It also was one of those post star wars films that capitalized off ufo myths tied in with ancient astronaughts like HANGAR 18. All of this makes for a fun story and has been fodder for years for writers searching for fiction story material. With some revamping the film could have been better. I sense budgetary constraints. As a boy I liked it and loved the escapism. Fans of older science fiction will enjoy this piece for a fun afternoon or evening. Fans of LARENCE OF ARABIA don't expect DAVID LEAN quality here. Expect escapism. 
tt0076760; Some trivia: Parts of Starship Invasions was filmed on the campus of the University of Toronto, in particular some of the UFO scenes were shot on the grounds of the then-new Robarts Library, facing the also very new Innis College (where Marshall McLuhan was teaching) In this film, Robert Vaughn basically plays the part of Dr. Ernie Seaquist, dean of Astrophysics at the U of T, and who, at that time, had pinned to the cork board outside his office a double page spread from the National Enquirer with an article quoting Prof. Seaquist and sporting the banner title with something like, "U of T Professor says there IS life in outer space" -- he said a journalist had called one day, asked him that question, so he explained the Drake Equation and how space was so unimaginably large, he'd be very surprised if we were alone.Sure enough, his quote does appear in the two-page article. As the last line. We were told in the Astrophysics dept that our projects could be on any subject, "Except astrology and UFOs." 
tt0076760; I saw this film once on afternoon television in the late 70's . I've never seen it screened, rented or sold since. It seems to have sank into obscurity. I remember being disturbed in parts, so as bad as it may be, it could be provocative for ten year old latch key children, home alone in the late 70's. One interesting thing to note, reading the plot summary offered at IMDb, I've seen some of the same elements in UFO abduction lore & accounts. There are some who believe that there has been an extraterrestrial culture occupying the bowels of the Earth for some time, a federation of races I believe, that use this symbol of the winged serpent as their identifying mark. Some believe that this federation ultimately does want control of the Earth and humanity, and will reveal themselves following some type of cosmic or nuclear calamity on the Earth. Also, the ability to exert remote and irresistible control of the human brain through superior technology is a theme I've read frequently in reports, as well as this film's attention to the commonly reported telepathic ability of the ET's. I mention this because it seems like most cinema avoids some of the more fantastic elements of abduction accounts, and concentrates on other elements to the point of clichA©. X-files hit on a lot of themes one can find in the reports, to be sure. I'd like to see this movie again, for nostalgia's sake. Sadly this isn't the UFO lore Epic I want. I'd like to see some talented writer/director do for modern abduction accounts what Spielberg did in Close Encounters with Project Bluebook reports. Some of the stuff they predict/report is genuinely terrifying, like, the apocalypse of mankind. The stakes don't get any higher. Perfect for Hollywood. A rich vein for creative exploration and sadly this little low budget film is about as close as it gets at the moment. 
tt0076760; Yes, this movie really is worth seeing. Mainly because two big named actors Robert Vaughn and Christopher Lee agreed to act in a film with FX, set direction, and costumes that look like they were slapped together at a church picnic.Really! This is a laugh riot! The plot: Vaughn is a renowned scientist and family man who's having his reputation damaged by speaking out publicly about UFOs. Apparently, Big Brother knows about the aliens and Earth and wants to keep the matter quiet.Like all media the term UFO doesn't mean "Unidentified Flying Object" such a insects, reflections of light, or lens' glare. UFO mean "Extra Terrestrial Spacecraft." Actually aliens are on earth doing experiments at several well hidden bases. But they're so advanced they come in peace and just want to study us. However, evil alien Christopher Lee heads a coup of their bases. Lee's evil alien race used up all their planet's resourced and now wants to enslave/destroy humanity.The surviving peaceful aliens reach out to Vaughn by literally landing on his front yard. Apparently only Vaughn is smart enough to develop a super weapon to defeat Lee.The sheer fact that Vaughn is able to keep a straight face during these scenes is side splitting!!! What the heck was used to blackmail Vaughn and Lee into being in this movie.I'd have to think once they saw the set which looks like a children's playhouse they would be kicking a screaming to get out of there! Some of these scenes are the funniest in motion picture history! 
tt0057558;  This was the third in the so-so TAMMY series, and it is certainly the best. Sandra Dee is absolutely adorable in the title role, the cute country bumpkin who is forever performing a good deed, for someone else, that is. This time she goes off with a sick, eldery friend(the great character actress Beulah Bondi) to a big city hospital and gets a job in the place to be near her. While she inadvertantly turns the hospital upside down with her hilarious mishaps, our folksy heroine falls for a handsome young doctor(Peter Fonda in his film debut). No classic, but this is a warm, funny, and occasionally touching movie. Sandra Dee is an absolute joy to watch, this was her second and last turn as the TAMMY character, her first was TAMMY TELL ME TRUE(1961) which was a sequel to TAMMY AND THE BACHELOR(1957) starring Debbie Reynolds. 
tt0057558; I am also a teenager and have deeply enjoyed this movie. Being from Mississippi Myself, I feel akin to her in her many plights, with dealing with folks that find many southerners to be very "funny peculiar"!! Anyway I know one thing i really enjoyed the Tammy in love song, it was so romantic how he was right there listening. Oh, I just really love this movie!!!!! I really like how Tammy takes God with her where ever she goes and that she isn't afraid to talk about him. Man, I kinda wish they still made movies like this, but with more African-Americans. Movies like this were just so innocent and didn't need all the hype and jive they need now. 
tt0057558;  Not as beautiful as "Tammy Tell Me True", but even funnier.Tammy is an implausibly innocent country bumpkin who clashes with the modern world. She has derogatory things to say about Shakespeare, Mozart, Psychology, Colleges, modern art, sleeping pills, freeways, conformism, phoniness.Tammy:  "You mean you been livin' with yourself all your life without ever knowing what you are???"Sandra Dee is brilliant in her role - and it is truly hers.Much of the movie's delight is in Tammy's ungrammatical speech. She says glorious things like "Be you gonna or be ya ain't" (Will you or won't you?). She asks a man "Bein't ya the dumb waiter?" and he sternly replies: "No, I be the chief of staff!"
tt0057558; I am a teenager and with all the junk out on television today this comedy/romance was refreshing. There was no vulgar language of such, except for Mr. Tripp saying one word which is funnily commented after. It is brilliant and I enjoyed every moment of it right up the ending. The backward "stanty boat" girl, who lived "betwist here and Vicksburg" all her life. And has never flown in a plane before. So if you want to see a truly great film this is one of them! Watch all three of them. The three would be Tammy and the bachelor, Tammy be true, and Tammy and the doctor! They are all special in the own way. You can them on AMC sometimes.Kayla 
tt0057558;  Sandra Dee and I are near the same age. I didn't pay too much attention to her acting career as a young adult, I mentally wrote her off as just another teen sensation that faded away rather quickly after she grew up. But recently I saw 'Gidget' again, and marveled at what a fine actress she was, and created such a unique and sympathetic character. In 'Tammy and the Doctor', at age 18/19, she did it again. A totally different character, a sheltered, bible-quoting Mississippi hick girl who sounds like she was raised by a southern black family. Totally foreign to what she really was, and she created one of the most endearing characters in any movie. As I watch her, so many of her mannerisms remind me of a fine modern young actress, Renee Zellweger from Houston. Both of them can be so expressive with their voices and their faces at the same time. But there will never be another Sandra Dee, and without her this would have been a very ordinary movie, and one not worth watching. Of note, the doctor was played by Peter Fonda, 24, in his first role. He looked a bit amateurish.The rest of my comments contain SPOILERS so you may quit reading at any word.  Tammy was in school in Mississippi and sharing a place with an older lady who became ill, a fancy doctor from Los Angeles came in with special equipment, decided she needed heart surgery but must be strengthened first. So Tammy went with her to Calif, only employees and patients could stay in the hospital, so through her charm got a job. Although bright, Tammy was very unsophisticated. Instead of just mopping floors, at times she was given chances to do more meaningful tasks, but each time she messed up and went back to mopping. Forgetting to put baby I.D. tags on properly, got them all mixed up, nursing mothers had a fit. In surgery prep, touched a surgeon's clothes, made him go through disinfecting again.  Cut a patient's traction rig when she thought he was going to hang himself. Borrowed a surgical instrument to cut bandages, when it went missing they almost re-opened a patient to find the missing instrument, but she returned it is time.Meanwhile, young intern (Fonda) and Tammy were falling for each other. In the end the older woman came through surgery in good shape, befriending the sour old man in the process, Tammy got her doctor, and she also was the catalyst to get the chief surgeon and his long-time nurse together. Not a very important movie, not one that deserved any awards, but one that showcases Sandra Dee at her very finest. She truly is one of the underappreciated actresses of the 1960s. 
tt0057558;  I thought this movie was well done, and that Sandra Dee was a very good Tammy Tyree, however I think that Debbie Reynolds did a better job when she originally played this character in Tammy and the Bachelor. I also think that Tammy Tell Me True was a little bit sweeter than this movie. On it's own it is a great film, but when compared to the others, it's just not as good. 
tt0057558; As a young teen, I watched all of the " Tammy " movies that came on TV. It did not matter if the part was being played by Sandra Dee or Debbie Reynolds. I just couldn't wait to see what Tammy had to say next or how she was going to say it, to see the reaction on other faces and how they take it. I could really relate to this movie being from Alabama. I understood some of the sayings from her grandfather that the people in the movie didn't. I dreamed of being on a river boat having the adventures that Tammy had and I would sit with Tammy and listen to her stories. Sandra Dee is captivating, a wonderful actress, plays a loving friend role and is just so funny especially when she is trying to be so serious. I think everyone should see it, especially those in the medical profession. 
tt0057558; Being from the south, I'm insulted by the portrayal of Tammy's speech. No one--I repeat--no one from the south has, does, or ever will speak that way. I've known some very backwoods people in my time, and even they did not speak in the way that the Tammy character does in this movie. It makes no sense and is very unrealistic. It's too bad that the writers didn't spend a single day in Mississippi to see how people from that state actually talk. While the plot is just as implausible as well, there are some slightly refreshing and entertaining aspects to this movie. It cannot, however, come even close to being compared to the original--Tammy and the Bachelor, a much classier movie. 
tt0077326; I've seen this movie three times and I've always gotten the same feeling. It is far from being perfect but nevertheless it has a powerful force thats goes through it. It is maybe Sanchez's strong faith in family values, who knows. Anthony Quinn really gives one of his warmest and more intense performances here, he is truly believable as Sanchez and never tries to overact as he used to in other movies. What I found really interesting is the fact that Quinn seems a sympathetic character, but he's full with contradictions and flaws: he is a real Mexican macho, he is incapable of showing his feelings, he is not very understanding to his family, but on the other hand he makes his best to protect them and to get them close to him. This is what makes his character seem so real. Clashes between Consuelo (his older daughter) and himself are among the best moments in the film. She is tough and won't accept old fashioned values as a common law, she wants to be independent and feel free as a woman, while other females in Sanchez's house think they must obey their macho. Her struggle to get rid of family ties is a rough one, but it will lead to a final understanding with her father. This film is particularly interesting if one wants to know what it feels like to being inside a Mexican-type environment as it was some time ago, and how difficult it may be to change one's mind. Chuck Mangione's score is so powerful it only adds strength to the story as it explains hidden violence in some character's "mal de vivre". Lupita Ferrer is touching as Consuelo, pity she didn't show again such a strong presence in other movies. 
tt0077326; First this is not a movie for people seeking action. This is a movie that is for the most part the a character study of a poor man in Mexico. Consider it a bit like and there will be blood except that it doesn't have the greed of one man holding everything together instead it has the religious duty of keeping his family together as the glue. I suspect a large problem with the movie was the music. Prior to the movies release Chuck Mangione performed the entire soundtrack on a PBS show live from wolf creek... while this managed to generate some buzz on the movie it also resulted in false expectations. The upbeat music did not prepare people for the drudgery that was the life of a poor Mexican. Had people viewed it as a life of a poor man, they might have viewed it differently. The acting by Quinn is perfect. Its worth a look but make sure your in the right frame of mind. 
tt0077326;  Oh, boy.  My brother is a jazz trumpet player and saw this film a year or so ago because of the Mangione score.  It instantly became his least favorite film OF ALL TIME.  He would groan and dry-sob over it, telling me how unbelievably poor it was, and even he admitted that the score matched nothing that happens in the film.Being a lover of truly bad cinema, I gave this the old college try, despite his warnings that it was intolerable and seemed to go on forever.  He was oh-so-right.This heaving waste heap begins with a snail paced procession of Catholics making a pilgrimage through the Mexican desert, bearing a cross and all. Mangione's 'accompanying' music is incredibly upbeat and fast, sounding like it would be more appropriate during a car chase on 'CHiPs!'  It reminded me of an effect that Fellini goes after intentionally in '8 1/2,' where you see very old, slow and fragile people parade by a panning camera to Wagner's "Ride of the Valkyries."The first true sign that this movie has serious trouble is the fact that 17 minutes into the show, they are still giving you subtitles, explaining who characters are!  There are so many people in this movie that it would be near impossible to know who they were in one viewing, let alone with sub-titles (i.e., SO-AND-SO SANCHEZ: son of Jesus, or SO-AND-SO SANCHEZ: daughter of Jesus).  This points to two things - the screenplay is weak beyond the shame of such a gimmick (and trust me, it is!), and/or the producers panicked when the film was done and realized they should've chopped half the characters from the book right out of the film.  The absolute most ludicrous moment comes when, at the end of a long day at work, late at night Sanchez comes up to a door in the city.  Where could he possibly be?  At home, of course, ready for food and bed.  Then the subtitle comes: HOME OF SANCHEZ.  What, did you think people were that STUPID?! This is like a gag out of 'Airplane!'The film's production values are that of low budget 70's tv, the acting is terrible (except Quinn, he's just Quinn), and the ending is not to be believed.  This thing never seems like it will end - I first checked to see how long it had been running, hoping it was almost over, at the 1 hr 7 min mark!   Absolutely, 100% deplorable.  
tt0077326; Dark and dismal neorealism meets dreary film noir in the 1978 The Children of Sanchez, which, despite its interesting cast proves a most disappointing Mexican-American collaboration thanks mainly to an over-indulgent director (Hall Bartlett) and screenwriters (Cesare Zavattini and Bartlett) who give Anthony Quinn leave to over-act in numerous, long-held close-ups. He's even allowed to upstage Dolores Del Rio in her big scene (her final film too). And I couldn't even spot Katy Jurado! Fortunately, the lovely Lupita Ferrer gets a fair innings, but Gabriel Figueroa's photography does not come off well in either of the two DVD versions. Quinn and Del Rio speak their own dialogue in the Trinity disc, but in Vanguard's Spanish edition, they are both dubbed. Oddly, the sound mix in the Spanish release is far superior to the American. 
tt0077326; Remember seeing this movie in the late Seventies. Based on a well known novel, it is the story of an aging and impoverished Mexican widower/patriarch/despot who does his best to raise and feed his extended primary family (he has at least two other children by different women other than by his long deceased saintly wife)and keep them together under one roof. Rebellious daughters and wayward sons fit right into the mix, marrying/co-habitating and giving him many grandchildren--which guarantees that the family keeps on growing and that the cycle will continue. DVD is now available in full screen version at Amazon.com, and possibly at other sites. Neither video nor audio are very sharp or clear, but definitely still worth watching. Last film of famed Mexican actress Dolores Del Rio, and one of the last for equally famous Mexican actress Katy Jurado. Duncan Quinn is credited at the end, and I believe noted Mexican singer Ignacio Lopez Tarzo is also in this movie, but not credited. Didn't recognize Bette Davis, though, if she indeed did a cameo in this movie. Cheers. 
tt0077326; This isn't the sort of movie anyone should watch for a good time. This is the sort of movie academics or Mexican cultural enthusiasts should watch to get an insight into Mexican life in the 70's. I'm currently living in Mexico, and to some degree many traits of the characters still exist in the people today. After having lived here and taken classes on the culture I can see where every trait comes from and it in fact was interesting because of that. It starts off with a slow procession because that is what many people still do during the week leading up to December 12th (Day of the Virgin of Guadalupe). The religious beginning is a god start to showing how the rest of the characters are affected by their faith. Women are expected to be pure and pious and so the over aggressive men feel like they have to maintain those characteristics in the women. It also is about the progress Mexican women were trying to make in their lives at the time whether it was defying their families wishes and marrying the "wrong man" or leaving their family all together. Basically, it is a movie about a poor family and a power hungry man who suddenly gets a step up in society. Unless you are into cultural diversity or old Mexico... rent Aliens or something because yes, you will be bored. 
tt0077326;  Geez, one of the most uninteresting movies ever made, or at least from the 70's. How they got Anthony Quinn in this is beyond me, he must have felt bad for the rest of the actors or something. I have to agree, the "Home of Sanchez" caption was the dumbest part of the whole movie, it seemed like it was from a comedy. This film seemed it would never end, and it bored me to the point of changing the channel after 37 minutes, but there was nothing else on, so I was stuck. Just plain horrible, the perfect cure for insomnia. 
tt0374660; I just love it when a film maker spends more time on the script than the glitz, and Footpath is nothing short of gritty when it comes to that. Arjun, Shekhar, Raghu and Sanjana are all childhood friends (Sanjana is actually the younger sister of both Shekhar and Raghu) who grew up in a tough neighbourhood in Mumbai and witness more than children should in the process. A case of revenge gone awry sends young Arjun fleeing for his life to New Delhi. 12 years pass and some police officers finally track him down and offer him a deal that they won't expose him provided he goes undercover for them to unveil the source of drug trafficking in Mumbai. Arjun reluctantly agrees to do the job only to reach Mumbai and find out that the key drug peddlers are his childhood friends Shekhar and Raghu. A life of deceit, lies, denial, betrayal, loneliness, and guilt ensues in this lush suspenseful drama that is Foothpath. The title of the film actually comes from the famous footpath that people walk on in the neighbourhood where the kids grew up. Bipashu Basu gives a riveting performance as the bittersweet Sanjana, and Aftab Shivdasani is stellar as Arjun! Not to mention the awesome chemistry he shares with the brothers and sister, especially the sister. The music is as haunting as it is beautiful. The acting is superb and award worthy. A must see! 
tt0374660; This is an interesting film in that it begins as a solid 10 but gradually loses fractions of points as it bows to Bollywood conventions. If director Vikram Bhatt would have forgone some of those clichA©d moves, which seem present only to appeal to the lowest common denominator, and tightened up the film a bit both in terms of its story and its pacing/running time, this could have easily been a 10.Footpath is the tale of four childhood friends in Mumbai--Arjun Singh (Aaftab Shivdasani), Rahul Srivastav (Emran Hashmi), Shekhar Srivastav (Rahul Dev), and Sanjana (Bipasha Basu). Rahul and Shekhar have a tendency to get into trouble. Arjun has a tendency to hang out with them, and Sanjana, despite being friends with all of them, is always trying to coax Arjun to get on a straight and narrow path.Throwing a monkey wrench into the works, Arjun's father, a union leader, is killed by anti-unionists at the beginning of the film. Arjun witnesses his father's death. Rahul and Shekhar find out who killed him and urge Arjun to seek vengeance. When Arjun cannot carry it out, his friends do so instead. Arjun is sent away, although Rahul sees him off with a heartfelt oath that they will always be friends, no matter what.Years later, Arjun is living in New Delhi under an assumed name. The police blame him for the retribution death and may still be looking for him after all of this time (although this might just be a "front"). They catch up to him and propose an odd deal--if Arjun will help them penetrate a ring of drug dealers, enabling them to find out who is the high man on the totem pole, they'll let Arjun go free. To make matters more complicated, the drug dealers are the Srivastav brothers, and the policeman in charge reveals that he has just received an encounter order (a kind of governmentally-authorized hit) on the Srivastavs. If Arjun doesn't cooperate, not only will he be arrested and tried for the long-past murder, his friends will assuredly end up dead.Although roughly taken from State of Grace (1990) and bearing similarities to Footpath co-writer Mahesh Bhatt's Angaaray (1998), that's a great premise and Vikram Bhatt effectively milks it to achieve tonal similarities to The Godfather (1972) and Scarface (1983), but with more of an emphasis on friendship and complex romances. In the beginning, at least, the direction, script, cinematography and performances all come together to create a taut, gritty and compelling story. The cinematography during the opening is some of the best I've seen from Bollywood yet--it's appropriately gloomy, with interesting angles/set-ups and it's well edited. To make the film even more attractive, Bhatt admirably pulls no punches when it comes to violence and later gives us an unusual amount of sexiness, too (at least compared to the Bollywood films I've seen so far).But slight problems begin to arise when Bhatt makes concessions to tradition. The first song in the film enters when Arjun, Rahul and Shekhar head to a club that might be some kind of Indian equivalent to a "girlie" club. In this context, the song mostly works--it at least feels "organic" to the film. However, it gets blown up slightly into the typical big production number, which takes away some of the atmosphere of a girlie club.However, there are a number of later songs that are more typical of Bollywood musicals--in the middle of the narrative, characters suddenly break out into song, and they're suddenly traveling around the country to sing in different locales. And even though this is essentially a film about gangsters and friendships, the songs are still in the context of romances, with characters rambling on and on about not being able to sleep at night, pining for the one they desire, being "tortured" by love, and so on. Every song seemed to include the words "dil" ("heart") and "pyaar" ("love") in every line. Not every film needs these types of songs, and especially not every film needs romance songs. The romance subplots, sans the songs, are fine. There are two of them, and they both work well when they're done in a dramatic mode. But the songs simply break the mood of the film, and what was an excellent, tight and gripping gangster flick becomes generic clips on an Indian variety television show. I subtracted a point for this, but would have subtracted more if the film weren't otherwise so excellent.The other point I subtracted for a combination of two things. The first is what I call "sprawl". Somewhere in the middle, the narrative begins getting a bit loose--not enough to lose one's attention, but enough to amplify how streamlined and focused the beginning of the film was in contrast. It seems like this might be another bow to convention--Bollywood films traditionally run between 2 and 3 hours, tending closer to 3. But not every film needs to be that long. Footpath could have used some trimming. The other problem was that a few scenes towards the end of the film are a bit overacted and overdirected. Bhatt is trying to amplify the emotional impact of these scenes. But they would have played better, and been more impactful, if understated instead.The above is more nitpicking than specifying serious structural problems. Overall, Footpath is a very good film, but it had the potential to be quite excellent. It would not have needed to be unprecedented to be an excellent film. The technical elements are mostly superb. The performances and direction are mostly superb. The story is beautifully gritty, enthralling and relatively chance-taking. It's important for Bollywood filmmakers to know that for at least some of their audience, bowing to conventions is hurting more than helping. There is great artistry in Bollywood films, and no need to put a veil over it by squeezing the artistry into a template. 
tt0374660; Emraan Haashmi is one of the popular heroes (though not in the league of the Khans or the Deols) of Bollywood today. Footpath (2003) is his debut movie which was made by his uncles Mahesh Bhatt and Mukesh Bhatt as his launchpad only. I had gone to watch it mainly because of its songs because I had listened to its music album containing some beautiful compositions of Nadeem Shravan and I had liked them very much. That liking only led me to watch the movie also.Footpath is nothing but one of the many Bollywood versions of Hollywood movie - Angels with Dirty Faces (1938). Mahesh Bhatt himself had directed one of such versions which was Angaaray (1998) taking Akshay Kumar in lead role and Naagarjuna in second lead. He wrote the script of Footpath with the same basic grains but handed over the duty to direct the movie to Vikram Bhatt. Aaftaab Shivdaasaani has been cast in the lead role (done by Akshay Kumar in Angaaray) and debutante Emraan Haashmi has been taken in the second lead. Another associated but meaty role has gone to Raahul Dev. Well, when there are males, females are also needed as their love interest. So Bipasha Basu, Aparna Tilak and Anupama Verma are there as the leading ladies.Foothpath is the story of three friends who get separated in childhood due to an incident that concluded with the murder of a person. Out of these three friends, two are real brothers having a sister also who likes the friend of her brothers very much. This bloody incident has taken place in Mumbai in which the friend of the brothers and the sister has already lost his father. Being an orphan now, he runs away from the city itself and grows up as Arjun (Aaftaab Shivdaasani). Twenty years have passed since then and Arjun is living the straight life of a law-abiding citizen in Delhi when a cop (Anup Soni) meets him and pressurizes him to do the job of an undercover agent of the police against his childhood buddies who are outlaws and still operate in Mumbai as drug-dealers.A reluctant Arjun moves to Mumbai and meets his childhood buddies Shekhar (Raahul Dev) and Raghu (Emraan Haashmi) who work for a big narcotics smuggler Sheikh (Irrfaan). He happens to meet their sister Sanjana (Bipasha Basu) also who lives separately from her brothers because of not liking their illegal activities. The childhood love of Arjun and Sanjana gets rekindled on one hand and Arjun tries to draw his friends out of the quagmire of crime. In case of Raghu who is more sensitive and emotion-led, he succeeds because of Raghu's love for an English teacher (Aparna Tilak) who loses her brother because of his being a drug-addict. However Shekhar is not that sensitive and Arjun fails in bringing him out of the world of crime. The story ends with the union of Arjun and Sanjana after the elimination of the drug smuggling racket running in Mumbai as well as the deaths of Shekhar and Raghu.This story of an undercover agent working against his own friends has been hackneyed like anything in Bollywood. Only a good and engaging script written for this another version of Angels With Dirty Faces would have succeeded in appealing to the audience. Unfortunately, neither the script, nor the direction is up to the mark in case of Footpath. The movie has its moments but overall, it fails to impress the viewer. All the characters of the movie appear to be artificial. All the incidents shown in the movie appear to be completely filmy. None of the three romantic angles has been developed properly. Hence this movie can be sit through and enjoyed only when the viewer watches it with a low expectation.The biggest flaw that I found in the script and the direction of this movie that Arjun takes an easier path. He keeps on pursuing Raghu, the sensitive one to leave the wrong path and doesn't make even the smallest effort for pursuing money-minded and insensitive Shekhar to mend his ways.Music is one of the plus points of the movie. As said earlier, I was instigated to see this movie only by certain songs of the movie. One good song - Chain Aapko Mila Mujhe Deewangi Mili is only in the album and not in the movie (interestingly, it was used in another movie - Hungama released in 2003 itself). Saari Raat Teri Yaad Mujhe Aati Rahi, Kitna Pyara Pyara Hai Sama, Zara Dekh Mera Deewaanapan, Ab Samajh Aaya Ki Duniya Kya Hai etc. are quite good to ears. Their picturization is also okay.Technically, the movie is so-so. Its length is definitely on the higher side. Girish Dhamija has written routine dialogs for it.Emraan Haashmi has drawn his heart out for this debut movie of himself. He has delivered a very touching and impressive performance, giving signals that he's the horse of a long race. All others including my favourite heroine Bipasha Basu and highly talented Irrfaan are, unfortunately, just routine. TV actress Aparna Tilak has played Emraan's love interest. This is the only appearance of hers on the big screen (never acted in any other movie). Though she has got a meaty role, she hasn't been able to impress. Anupama Verma has played Shekhar's love interest in this movie and her role appears to be that of a glorified extra. Aaftaab Shivdaasaani is miscast in the lead role.With my rating of 2.5 stars, I recommend Footpath as a one time watch to those who like the music of Nadeem Shravan as well as to die-hard Emraan Haashmi fans. 
tt0374660; Footpath is a great under rated movie in bollywood. It borrows a little from Sean Penn movie State of Grace. It even borrows from an older Mahesh Bhatt movie with Akshay Kumar. Cant remember the name of the previous film it copied. Footpath is a far better version with great acting and plot. This is the debut of Emraan Hasmi and he has done a fantastic job playing the bullied little brother. Rahul Dev delivers a strong performance and suits the character. Aftab is decent compared to his other films. Bipasa Basu is ermm well cant think o what to say. She looks sexy and id like to get naughty with her. The other actress is pretty. It has a nice song and it is definitely worth watching. 
tt0374660; Mahesh Bhatt's ANGAAREY(1998) was a flop at the B.O, The film a remake of STATE OF GRACE(1990).Surprisingly even Salman Khan's AUZAAR had a similar story which released in 1997 and flopped ANGAAREY was a well made film with some flaws like some forced masala elements and a weird villain Gulshan Grover and the film tilted towards action to fit Akshay's action hero image but yet it stands out as Akshay's one of decent films of 90s when his career was going through bad times. FOOTPATH(2003) follows the same part but yet the film isn't entirely bad, In fact in many ways it's better then ANGAAREY. Vikram Bhatt has done some changes in the film, Emraan's character is a mix of Nagarjun and Irfan Kamal of the original and the bonding is handled much better this time. Even the villainy is not like the original and treated much better. The film starts off well though in old fashioned style but yet scenes are well handled though several questions are unanswered like how Aftab becomes a real estate agent? Childhood love of Aftab-Bips also looks far-fetched, Plus the reason Aftab runs away in childhood is not too clear Yet the scenes between Aftab and Emraan, their coming together, their bonding Emraan's scenes with his sweetheart are well handled, also Bipasha- Aftab story is well handled but too many songs do get on the nerves There are several well handled scenes like Aftab confronting Anup Soni, The transformation in Emraan Hashmi's character, the film manages to evoke emotions, though the end does come across as tad filmy yet the drama is well handled.Direction by Vikram Bhatt is superb, The Mahesh Bhatt touch is evident throughout the film Music by Nadeem Shravan is tuneful, ZARA DEKH, KITNA PYARA and SAARI RAAT stand out but they do come at quick succession, the best song is Dost Milte hai by Kumar Sanu This film marks the first time Himesh and Emraan came together, as the song SOORAT TERI PYAARI is composed by Himesh Dialogues by Girish Dhamija are fantasticAftab Shivdasani tries very hard and does manage to play his character well, though at times he does try really too hard and it shows Yet this is one of his better performances. Bipasha Basu(with a dubbed voice) annoys with her heaving and hamming. The real find is Emraan Hashmi, who debuted this film, the actor was known as a serial kisser post MURDER but in this film he plays a lovable goon and plays it so perfectly for his debut, He even overshadows Aftab Shivdasani. Though his voice was dubbed by someone else(Regular in Bhatt films for a debut) Aparna Tilak is decent Rahul Dev is excellent, while Irfan Khan in a cameo excels as usual Anup Soni is fantastic rest are adequate 
tt1305796; Ken Scott did it again. I already loved the film he wrote, and now I discovered him again as a director. He did a great job with the 5 main actors. His style give us the time to breathe between the comedic elements and observe the changes the characters go through: but old habit dies hard. Paolo Noel is the surprise of the film. He does not say a lot, but when he does, you are sure to laugh. You may guess some of the ending, but Ken Scott throw a few curves so you still have a few surprises until the end.A great film to see with friends.Do not miss it. You will have a great time. 
tt1305796; Just saw this movie at the Lamorinda Film Festival in Orinda. This was one of the very few movies I have ever seen from French Canada. It is a fairly complex movie about some very unsuccessful petty criminals who sacrifice themselves to 4 years in prison, so that they can get their hands on $2 million dollars that one unapprehended partner is holding for them. But that guy has a task for them to do before they get the money and that is to walk the Route of Santiago in Spain. And a lot can go wrong. And a lot does, but that is the fun. Go see this movie if you have the opportunity. All the characters in this film are well brought out and the ending will be not exactly what you would have expected. 
tt1305796; Very enjoyable movie with several twists. A little memorable gem that deserves to be seen! Great plot, very good acting from everyone, especially Roy Dupuis. I won't spoil anything by saying they're bumbling gangsters since the description says they're the worst gangsters you can find... and it's probably true. BTW: The names they give at shelters are names of hockey-star players from The Canadians back in the days, lol ! Something akin to saying your name is Wayne Gretsky. For those looking for the songs, check Yt for : " Les Classels - Ton Amour A ChangA© Ma Vie", and "Oscar Thiffault - Le rapide blanc" or "awingna-han". 
tt0052749;  I've always liked this film.  It made me laugh when I first saw it as a youngster, and I got a bigger kick out of it as an adult.  As a former Naval officer, I can appreciate some of the silliness that Jerry goes through in this movie, from "inheriting" his ship, to the naval bureaucracy.Dina Merrill is great as Ensign Benson (I actually knew an Ensign Benson, and a Midshipman Shipman, but that's beside the point!) as is Mickey Shaugnessy as the Chief who helps him along (always listen to your Chief).There's silliness galore, but it wouldn't be Jerry Lewis without it.  Look for a nice homage/parody to the Caine Mutiny Courtmartial during the hearing scenes.  Gail Gordon is at his ornery best in these scenes.This is a lighthearted film that makes for an entertaining 90 minutes. Not a classic, but a lot of fun. 
tt0052749;  If you like a beloved comedian called Jerry Lewis, he's crazy humor and if you like especially he's classic old films, you'll love this one! I've seen almost all the most important Jerry comedies and my other favorite is The Nutty professor, other one is of course this! This is maybe not as famous as some of the other Jerry-films but it's twice as funny as many of those more famous ones. So if Jerry Lewis is not your thing, don't bother to watch this, but if you are a huge Jerry fan, you should see this one as quickly as possible because it's absolutely hilarious!  
tt0052749; The raw talent of comic Jerry Lewis, has rarely been equaled, but not often surpassed. He has entertained American audiences for decades. Today, his star power has become a present staple in France. Here, is one of his finer offerings. It's called " Don't Give up The Ship. " In this movie, Jerry plays John Paul Steckler the VII, who as fate would have it, is the Jr. Officer of the U.S.S. KornBlatt. Shortly before the end of WWII, he is ordered to sail the ship to the U.S. where the ship is to be decommissioned. Unfortunately, he is accidentally stranded on a Japanese held island and fails to report the loss of his ship. Now, years later, he is summoned to Washington, by Congressman Mandeville, (Gale Gordon) and Adm. Bludde (Robert Middleton) to explain where he last left his ship. This on the eve of his wedding. Only with the help of Ens. Benson (Dina Merrill) and Stan Wychinsky (Mickey Shaughnessy) can he hope to remember where the missing ship is. This film is one of Lewis's finest examples of true laughter in it's purest form. A Classic by any other name which has stood the test of time. **** 
tt0052749; The destroyer USS Kornblatt has been missing since World War II and Congressman Gale Gordon wants to know where it is. It's several million dollars worth of taxpayer's money from Uncle Sam. The last guy in charge was a career Navy man who since World War II has risen from Ensign to Lieutenant John Paul Steckler VII played in every generation by Jerry Lewis.Don't Give Up The Ship deals precisely with a guy who apparently did just that and can't find it now. In a brief prologue to the film we see how Jerry playing several members of his family served their country in a kind of homage to Alec Guinness in Kind Hearts and Coronets. Despite a Steckler serving in the Navy for seven generations, the USA still became a superpower.As VJ Day was celebrated the USS Kornblatt was given orders to sail to San Diego and be decommissioned. Every other officer had enough points for discharge so command devolved on Jerry Lewis. The Kornblatt stopped at an island where Lewis was captured by some Japanese soldiers left there who weren't told the war was over. His men left him there, thinking he was killed. That was the last he saw of his ship.With this renewed interest in the Kornblatt and Navy appropriations on the line, Admiral Robert Middleton has given Lewis a special assignment to find his lost destroyer. Aiding him is Ensign Dina Merrill from Naval Intelligence.On top of everything else Jerry's planning to get married to Diana Spencer and the wedding has to be postponed. Diana's not understanding her beloved working in close quarters with Merrill. Romantic complications are the last thing Jerry needs.I think Don't Give Up The Ship was one of Jerry Lewis's funniest solo films since breaking up with Dino. It's got a lot of good physical comedy that Lewis excelled at and many opportunities to overact outrageously and with gusto.It's a must for Jerry Lewis fans. 
tt0052749; It seems that the USS Cornblatt is missing. How can a USS Cornblatt be missing? Oh wait, Jerry Lewis was left in charge of it. In what I think is one of his best films, Jerry Lewis is at his funniest as he is trying to find this huge piece of metal, or else pay an exorbitant amount for it. But wait! He was just married and on his honeymoon, when he was shanghaied. Diana Spencer plays his new wife, and she is very good at being teasingly impatient. He tries to see his wife every chance he gets, but then he is quarantined to private quarters. Mabel Albertson is his mother who frowns on this inconvenience and especially the mention of Jerry's father, who was absolutely no good, absolutely. And, when Ensign Benson, played deliciously by Dina Merrill, is assigned to help Jerry look for the destroyer, he keeps trying to keep her away from his wife. Part of the story is told by way of flashback, when Ensign Benson puts him into hypnosis! Also costarring Mickey Shaughnessy, Gale Gordon, and Claude Akins, this is a feel-good film all over. Up there with "The Delicate Delinquent," this is simply Jerry Lewis at his best. 
tt0052749; I must admit that I am not a huge fan of Jerry Lewis' films. While I've seen all the ones he did with Dean Martin, I have avoided his solo films because (in my opinion) he tended to overact and subtlety was NOT a concern. I think my view is colored by my having seen some of his very worst solo films first. It's hard to watch another Lewis outing after having seen (uggghh!) "Cracking Up" (1983)--a film so bad that it went straight to video and the only movie I've ever watched that made me physically ill (seriously). So, in fairness, I decided to watch a few of his earlier films to see if they are worth seeing.While I would never say that "Don't Give Up The Ship" was no work of genius, it is a mostly pleasant little film. While Lewis DID occasionally mug and overplay things very badly, for the most part it's a decent little time-passer.Lewis is a lieutenant in the Navy during the present day. He's just gotten married and is about to embark on his honeymoon when he is arrested and brought to account for a ship he apparently 'lost' back in 1945 when the war ended. Where exactly the boat got to is what the big-wigs want to find out--and it's inexplicable that a ship could be misplaced for a decade and a half until anyone noticed this! Much of the film consists of flashbacks of Lewis during the war (when he was an ensign) as well as his meetings with a psychiatrist (Dina Merrill) who tries to dig into the facts.For the most part, there are no big laughs at all during this film--none. But, it also is pretty inoffensive as well--but could have been better had Lewis behaved like a relatively believable naval officer. As I said, his mugging and overplaying occasionally made the film tough viewing. But the film isn't bad in a mindless sort of way. Just turn off your brain and enjoy.By the way, in the underwater diving scene near the end, note that Jerry is sweating--and you can see sweat dribbling off his arms. Yet, he is supposed to be under water! This is a particularly dumb portion of the film (with very a very fake looking shark and octopus). Try to look past this. 
tt0052749; I do not know where these people got their info.,but for all intents and purposes,it's wrong.The movie,(or most of it)was filmed aboard the USS Gregory DD802.I was aboard the Gregory when it was filmed and participated in the filming as an extra.At least I guess thats what you'd call me,as I was a member of the crew.I was a BTFN at the time.Jerry Lewis tossed a ball with members of the crew and crewmen on a tender tied up opposite us at the pier during breaks and lunch.This was in 1955or56 I think,and I was transferred to the USS Vammen DE644 in June of 1958.I may be off a little on my dates but my memory of the filming is not.I cannot understand why anyone would say they were at the filming when they were not,unless they filmed at more than one location.Fred Williams 
tt0052749; As an addition to the above comments by sweetwater4 about the Vammen. I remember a plaque on the mess deck, located on a bulkhead next to the door going to the Chief's quarters, from the movie company thanking the crew for their assistance in filming the movie on board ship. Quite a few crew members appeared in the movie as extra's. I was a crew member on this ship from late 1960 to July 1963. Also when you see the movie it is quite clear that the ship has only one funnel. The Stembel had two funnels along with housed 5" guns where the DE's of this class had open mounts with 3" guns. The two silhouettes are quite different from on another. The Vammen was the only Buckley Class DE to have had the Bridge structure lowered. 
tt0052749; As with most of the old Jerry Lewis films, "Don't Give Up the Ship" was a very funny movie, rich in the old Jerry Lewis slapstick comedy. It was especially fun for me as I served aboard the ship used in the movie as the "USS Kornblatt". But, no, gentlemen, the trivia section here is incorrect as to the identity of that ship. It was NOT the USS STEMBEL (DD-644), a fleet Destroyer, but USS VAMMEN (DE-644), a Destroyer-Escort. That the "Kornblatt" was a DE was mentioned MANY times in the film. I'm certainly not trying to detract from the film, but merely trying to get my "old Home" some of the recognition she deserves. Sadly there is only one ship of her class that has been preserved as a museum ship anywhere in the country, USS SLATER. 
tt0052749; Jerry Lewis plays John Paul Steckler VII who has just got married to beautiful Prudence Trabert (Diana Spencer).The bliss doesn't last for too long.John happens to be a Navy officer and he was responsible for getting USS Kornblatt home after the WWII ended.USS Kornblatt is a battleship.John Paul Steckler (the seventh) has hard time remembering where he left the vessel.Now he has ten days to find it or he's in big trouble.He won't be having too much time for the honeymoon.He does get close to a woman but that woman isn't his wife.That woman is Ensign Rita Benson (Dina Merrill) who's there to help John Paul Steckler (the seventh) with his trouble.When Prudence finds out that the Ensign is a she and that they shared a cabin together in a train that means another trouble for John.This time marital.Norman Taurog's Don't Give Up the Ship (1959) gives the Jerry Lewis fans what they need, Laughs, lots of, lots of laughs.Jerry is surrounded in this movie with beautiful and talented ladies.Dina Merrill and Diana Spencer are both superb.Mickey Shaughnessy does the part of Stan Wychinski and he does it brilliantly.Robert Middleton is great as Bludde.There are lots of funny scenes in this movie.In one awfully funny one John is at the bottom of the sea diving with Stan.Oh man did I laugh! In another funny scene Jerry ends up in a wrestling ring.Jerry Lewis is the mastermind behind many classic movies.He may not have directed or written this one but he is there with his comedy.That's enough.His comic touch makes this movie something really special.Jerry's comedy is something very original, something you can't copy.Many have tried, many have failed.Some have gotten close maybe, but nobody can beat the original. 
tt0046415; How many versions of the famous novel are there in the world?Even the "best movie of all time "(sic) ,according to the IMDb users ,"Shawshank redemption", owes a lot to Alexandre Dumas and his count: Andy is DantA¨s and Red is Faria.Robert Vernay loved this novel so much he filmed two versions of it,the first one,reportedly the best (I have not seen it yet)was made in 1942 and featured two parts .So does this one :to see the whole ,the audience was requested to come back to the theater and pay again.One thing for sure,Jean Marais 's aristocratic look and his harsh face make him the perfect actor for this Nemesis role .The fifties version was in color , then something rare in the French cinema ,and was made with care and respect for the public.From start to finish ,Robert Vernay holds his audience spellbound because he knew to tell a story,a thing the N.W. used to ignore,with a few exceptions of course.Part 1: Betrayal Once again,Dumas combined history with fiction with talent.It begins in 1815,when king Louis the Eighteenth was on the throne and Napoleon was about to come back (Les Cents Jours).More than an innocent's plight,it's the opportunism of the magistrates ,waiting to see where the wind blows which is masterfully shown.On the king 's desk,there's a music box with a bird singing an old nursery rhyme which goes like this:"J'Ai Un Beau ChActeau Ma Tantirelire ..................... Nous Le DA©truirons Ma Tantirelirelo" (I 've got a beautiful chActeau .............................. We shall raze it to the ground..)When Napoleon arrives ,for a short while ,just before Waterloo,the first thing he does in the king's office is to play the little tune.The sinister ChActeau D'If and its dark spooky dungeons ,the meeting with L'AbbA© Faria ,and the escape are depicted brilliantly.Part 2: Revenge (is a dish best eaten cold)Generally ,in these movies in two parts (the French used to say "Epoques"= eras ),there was a summary (for people who could not have seen the first part),sometimes lines on the screen, more often a voice-over.Here Robert Vernay found a more interesting way: the hero tells his story to his henchman .The plot becomes very melodramatic with plenty of new characters and the story is not always as clear as in "betrayal" .There's even a touch of "Oliver Twist",written seven years before "Monte Cristo" .Marais is as impressive as the statue of the Commendatore and he 's got his duel in the end ,finally!All in all,if you like a good story,told with gusto and panache,this version of the famous novel was made for you 
tt0046935;  Is there such a thing as a male weeper?  Bang The Drum Slowly certainly belongs, as do parts of The Knute Rockne Story (`Let's win this one for the Gipper!').  Probably the whole athlete-dying-young genre does for men what Stella Dallas did for women.  Another candidate for inclusion is Drive A Crooked Road, a 1954 noir starring Mickey Rooney.Rooney's abbreviated stature helped keep him in pictures as America's oldest teen-ager. But once he hit 30, it was inevitable that adult roles should come his way.  As the noir cycle was in full swing, that's where he landed.  In The Strip and Quicksand, he still managed to pass as a stripling.  By the time of this movie, however, he was well into his 30s, with broad hits of chubbiness settling into his face and midriff.  He was still the star, not yet relinquished to character roles, though it was unclear how to handle him.  So he became a misfit Â<U+0096> a `freak.' He's an awkward, lonely auto mechanic with dreams of driving someday in the Grand Prix Â<U+0096> dreams he knows won't come true.  With one exception, his fellow mechanics tease him mercilessly, especially about his lack of sexual experience.  One day an unattainable woman (Dianne Foster) gives him the big eye, and he succumbs, however tentatively at first. (His ache for her is palpable when she plays hard to get, as he tosses on his rooming-house bed with his few racing trophies now emblems of hollow triumph). But she's just a cat's-paw for her real boyfriend, Kevin McCarthy, living the high life in his beach-house bachelor pad, he's planning to knock over a bank in Palm Springs and needs Rooney as his daredevil driver.  With Foster's increasingly reluctant urging, Rooney signs on....The resolution, of course, is the falling out of thieves, a large portion of the plot was to be echoed, 10 years later, in Don Siegel's remake of The Killers.  Though the robbery and escape should have been the centerpiece, or at least the central set-piece, of the movie, here it seems curiously perfunctory (these comments are based on viewing a version some minutes short of recorded running times, however).  But the movie's staying power lies in Rooney's portrayal of the dupe, the victim Â<U+0096> all the more memorable for being so understated.     
tt0046935; As other reviewers point out, America's favorite little guy was at a career crossroads at this point (1953). All in all, this downbeat low-budget caper film was a gutsy choice for MGM's former golden boy. Not only is Rooney's Eddie Shannon a rather pathetically repressed and vulnerable nobody, but the script stays entirely within that character, allowing Rooney none of his usual assertive (and often annoying) antics. The result is perhaps the biggest departure of his career, and also perhaps the most moving. The film itself is a good one, benefiting from unfamiliar Southern Cal locations, excellent acting from a number of up-&-comers, Jack Kelly , Kevin McCarthy, et al., and a plausible script. As a caper film, it's inferior to the best ones of that decade (The Asphalt Jungle, The Killing, etc.), but as an account of one man's sad and lonely plight (never a Hollywood biggie), it holds its own with the best of them, thanks to Rooney. 
tt0046935;  I saw this one at the theater, as a kid, when it came out. I have searched for a VHS copy of this one for years, and finally came across it recently on the internet.  It is no wonder that this one stayed with me for so long.  This is without a doubt Mickey Rooney's best movie as an adult.  It would seem that after the war and the Andy Hardy series wound down that Mick was having a difficult time finding his niche in Hollywood.  He did score very well with "Quicksand"(1950)but in this one he pulls out all the stops.  Constantly he is referred to as "the little freak" and several comments are made concerning his manhood, or lack thereof.  We slowly watch as Mick is played off by the gangster's moll, lured into the web of robbery and deceit, this is NOT a pretty movie. The movie builds slowly to an unforgettable, unexpected climax.  Still a great movie after almost 50 years! 
tt0046935; Drive A Crooked Road was a great performance by Mr. Mickey Rooney. I'm never ceased to be amazed by this man's talents. As a child I used to watch his films and he always amazed me then and always will. I recently discovered this classic gem and is one of the best performances of Mr. Rooney's. Mickey Rooney always gives a good performance. Mickey Rooney plays an auto mechanic who is framed by the girl he thinks loves him. Mickey Rooney did a lot of great film noir in the 50's. For other great Rooney 1950's performances check out Baby Face Nelson, The Big Operator, The Last Mile (an amazing performance by Rooney.) You will not be disappointed. 
tt0046935; Hell hath no fury like a man scorned.Mickey Rooney starts out as if he is a Danny Kaye milque-toast character. Taken in by Diane Foster, he soon meets up with 2 guys who want his driving talent to be used in robbing a bank.Rooney is great here as he goes from a quite guy, afraid of really living to aiding the guys in the heist.Hurt by the betrayal of Foster, she shows compassion at the end and this leads to tragedy as Rooney becomes a killer.This is really film-noir at its very best.The robbery was a complete success but the thieves were done in by personal reactions. This one is worth catching. 
tt0046935;  Single greatest B picture I've ever seen.  Sad ending is beyond belief, yet there is comic relief in the middle that is really funny.  Mickey Rooney wondered why Redbook magazine voted this best picture of the year (over the A pictures.)  He should have SEEN the picture!  An absolutely unforgettable movie. 
tt0046935; Richard Quine probably has his best "non comedy" film with this one, but maybe has to take the rap also for what's weak about this film. The opening car race and the key bank "race" are pretty blandly done as is any other action set piece in the movie. The opening scene is really poor, like something you'd see in a film made in the Early silent days. Badly matched rear projection, the camera angle is so wrong in the rear projection that is doesn't match the action of Rooney driving at all. The process work isn't bad, the footage shot is. The rest of the race material is also poor. And for a film about the ability to race, the fact that the racing is bad can't be overlooked. After this crappy beginning the excellent performances and dialog drive the film along perfectly. Most of the cast is perfect and the personal violence between characters is very strong. Rooney is very understated here--in many of his other adult work he'd tend to over act, not here though at all. It's an award worthy performance.Just too bad that the action is treated like sloppy second unit work--some say (un)credited to Blake Edwards himself--but with Edwards interest in fast cars etc., hard to believe he'd shoot this stuff so badly. The ending, which also involves some action is perfunctorily done and the resolution too quick. Too bad because otherwise this would be a nearly perfect movie. Still if you get over, the opening especially, this is a must see. 
tt0046935; In his youth, and in particular his heyday over at MGM, Mickey Rooney would practically do cartwheels through his roles - he was that high energy. However, he was capable of something more than playing the energetic optimistic young man of pre-war America, and this film and 1950's Quicksand are probably the best examples of what that something was.Here he plays auto mechanic Eddie Shannon that also does some race car driving. A mob of thieves take note of his talent behind the wheel at the race track and the gang leader's girl (Dianne Foster as Barbara) flirts with Eddie and gets him to believe that she loves him. Then the thieves lower the boom on him - they proposition him to drive their getaway car during a bank robbery in return for 15000 dollars. The reason that Eddie is so needed is that the road between the bank and the main highway past the point where any road blocks would be requires fast driving over what amounts to unpaved desert terrain. Eddie's an honest guy, willing to wait and work for the things he wants, but Barbara is holding out the need for this quick money as a condition of their relationship continuing, so he gives in and agrees to the robbery plan. To him, Barbara is his treasure, not any amount of money that he could land. Little does he know she's fool's gold.Rooney is convincing as the little guy who takes it on the chin from a verbally abusive coworker at the garage who - like all bullies - doesn't seem to realize that high school is at least ten years behind him. Without saying much you can tell Rooney's character Eddie is a guy that has come to have low expectations of life, not so much abused as he is ignored and invisible to the opposite sex, and is surprised when a beautiful girl takes notice of him. Things are getting out of hand for Barbara too, as she feels deep remorse for using Eddie. Kudos also go to Kevin McCarthy and Jack Kelly as the two thieves. McCarthy's character has a very thin veneer of charm painted over what appears to be a soul of pure evil. When he kisses a rather apathetic Barbara and doesn't like her lack of enthusiasm, he warns her to never kiss him like that again in a way that will give you goosebumps. Jack Kelly's character is more of an all out wild man. You can just tell that he considers violence the most amusing pastime on earth. I'd recommend this one for Rooney's performance, but I'd downgrade this one just a little bit on lost opportunities for what could have been some fine action shots during the bank robbery scene and the getaway thereafter. 
tt0046935; I tuned into this movie expecting to see Mickey Rooney doing his impersonation of a dramatic role. I mean, Mickey Rooney. Has anybody ever seen him do anything on film that wasn't over the top? Well, tune into this movie. I think you'll be as surprised as I was. The story has to do with a lonely, out of step guy who has a dream of racing in The Grand Prix. He's an accomplished mechanic, who races on weekends, but you know he'll never amount to anything. Along comes, long legged Dianne Foster. He falls hard, and she sucks him into a devious plot to rob a bank. What Mickey doesn't know is that she is in cahoots with a couple of classy mutts played by Kevin McCarthy and Jack Kelly. Foster lures the Mick into driving the getaway car so they'll have the money for him to race and they can live happily ever after. Not a chance. The plan all along is to ditch Mickey after the robbery, so she can run off with the mutts. Poor Mick never catches on on until the hammer drops, but by this time, the girls conscience gets the best of her and she spills the beans to Mickey. There is an explosive ending, but it does leave the viewer hanging a little.This is a Columbia cheapo, but the story is tight and well written. More importantly, the acting is first rate. All the principals really perform, but it's Mickey movie. He underplays the part of Eddie the sap perfectly. I didn't think it was possible, but this was later in his career, and I wish he had done more like it. It proved to me that he had much more range than one would think. I have to wonder if his height held him back. Or maybe it was his earlier body of work. Either way, I know he had much more to offer than Hollywood ever asked of him. Keep an eye open for it. You won't be disappointed. 
tt0046935; I should say that "Drive a Crooked Road" probably won't hold your attention quite as much as most movies that I've seen. What's mostly eye-opening about it is just seeing Mickey Rooney in a gritty role in a film noir. He plays Eddie Shannon, a mechanic with little aim in life. The high points in his daily routine are when his co-workers ogle women walking by the shop. But when he gets mixed up with the wrong woman, he suddenly finds himself involved in a bank robbery with apparently no way out.While some people might assert that Mickey Rooney was miscast here, I beg to differ. In this role, he shows that he can be something totally different from the "family-oriented" roles with which he's usually been associated (though I best remember him from "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World" and "Night at the Museum"). This movie is approximately as gritty as the average film noir, and while it's not any kind of masterpiece, still worth seeing. As it's apparently not widely available on video or DVD, Portland's video/DVD store Movie Madness has a copy.Also starring Kevin McCarthy (of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers") and Jerry Paris (the neighbor on "The Dick Van Dyke Show"). 
tt0046426;  Randolph Scott often shines as typical westerner. Here he plays Captain Potter a perfect example for Christian charity. He even prefers humiliation and danger to reputation of his lovely wife. He is a hero and a saint.Scott never looks unbelievable in his part.Lex Barker, former Tarzan and later superman "Old Shatterhand", plays against his image as arrogant villain. And I think he does it very well.The story is entertaining and there are a lot of other good actors like Henry Hull, Phyllis Kirk and Elisha Cook jr. in it.This really is an enjoyable B-western directed by veteran Andre de Toth.  
tt0046426; "Thunder Over the Plains" is another of those enjoyable little 80 minute color westerns turned out by Randolph Scott in the 1950s. Competently directed by Andre deToth, the film keeps moving along and doesn't get too bogged down with the domestic issues. And there's another of those great supporting casts of recognizable faces.This one takes place in Texas following the U.S. Civil War before the state re-entered the Union and was governed by the occupying Union Army. Capt. David Porter (Scott) is charged with the protection of government officials in their dealings with local land owners. The only trouble is these officials are nothing but carpetbaggers who over tax and cheat the farmers out of their property.Chief among the carpetbaggers are Tax Commissioner Joseph Standish (Elisha Cook Jr.) and cotton broker H.L. Balfour (Hugh Sanders). Porter, a native Texan, is accused of bias towards the settlers by his commanding officer, Lt. Col. Chandler (Henry Hull) who doesn't want to upset his superiors as he is within two years of retirement.Aiding the settlers is Ben Westman (Charles McGraw) a sort of "Robin Hood" who with his gang that includes Faraday (Lane Chandler), Kirby (Fess Parker) and henchman John Cason foil Balfour at every turn. Col. Chandler orders Porter to bring Westman in.Trigger happy Captain Bill Hodges (Lex Barker) arrives and is placed under Porter's command. He also has designs on Porter's attractive wife Norah (Phyllis Kirk). Hodges moves on Westman's hideout against Porter's orders and allows the bandit to escape. Hodges however, shoots Kirby in the back without provocation.When Standish witnesses Balfour murder a cohort, he becomes nervous and threatens to inform the authorities. Balfour murders Standish and pins the blame on Westman. In order to clear his name Westman allows Porter to take him in on Porter's promise to find the guilty party. Col. Chandler gives Porter only three days before he orders Westman hanged. After Hodges bungles another battle with Westman's gang, Chandler orders that Westman be hung the next morning. Porter goes to Westman's gang for help forcing a final showdown with Balfour and his gunman Conrad (James Brown) where.....................................Scott gives his usual excellent stiff jawed performance. Unusual for him, he remains in uniform for most of the film. Barker had recently finished his "Tarzan" series (1948-52) for RKO in which he replaced Johnny Weissmuller. Henry Hull is probably best remembered for "Werewolf of London" (1935) in which he played the title role.Fess Parker would shortly become Davy Crockett for Disney and later play Daniel Boone on TV. James Brown (not the football player or the Soul Singer) is best remembered for playing Lt. Rip Masters on the long running "Rin Tin Tin" TV series. Elisha Cook appeared in "Shane" the same year as "Torrey" the settler who is gunned down by Jack Palance. Also in the cast are Trevor Bardette as a settler and Earle Hodgins as a fast talking auctioneer. 
tt0046426; This film takes place in Texas after the civil war. The "carpetbaggers" were buying cotton bales for ridiculous prices after it was auctioned. Randolph Scott is Captain Porter who is obliged to maintain the law even though he is really on the side of those who are fighting the carpetbaggers, whose leader is Ben Westman (Charles McGraw). Scott does not resign only because he thinks someone else will be much harsher. When Captain Hodges (Lex Barker) shows up with a different point of view, you know trouble is coming, he even starts seducing Scott's wife Norah (Phyllis Kirk). Entertaining, with a lot of action and great color like most of Scott's films of the fifties. 
tt0046426; Thunder Over The Plains starts with the same premise as John Wayne's Red River and Randolph Scott's earlier film, The Texans. That is the corrupt rule of carpetbaggers post the Civil War. But there are no large herds of cattle to be driven north for profit to escape the burdensome taxes laid down by the occupying carpetbagger civil servants and the army to back them up. Randolph Scott is a Union army captain, but also a Texan and he sees both sides. Henry Hull is his put upon commanding officer and Charles McGraw plays a leader of a local gang who have risen up like Robin Hood among the oppressed. These guys aren't Ku Klux Klan nightriders by any means though.Our villains are Hugh Sanders and Elisha Cook, Jr. a pair of scurvy lowlifes if there ever were. They've got quite the little self perpetuating racket. The more they extort, the more McGraw raids, the more Sanders and Cook cry that the army has to stay in Texas. Just about anything is blamed on McGraw and his men.There's also a domestic crisis of sorts with newly arrived captain Lex Barker, an arrogant sort who was on duty in Washington and would like to get back there. Barker's bored and he makes a play for Phyllis Kirk who is married to Randolph Scott. Since they don't like each other from the beginning that only increases the problem.Andre DeToth who did several westerns including a few with Randolph Scott brought home a good one here. With themes like an attempt at adultery here, this was not a western for the Saturday matinA©e kiddie trade. DeToth's best in my opinion is one called Ramrod with Joel McCrea and his then wife Veronica Lake, but this one is pretty good too.DeToth also learned from the best and the final shootout scene with Scott against four men bears no small resemblance to High Noon, released a year earlier.Definitely one of Randolph Scott's best westerns of the Fifties. 
tt0046426; This just became one of my favorite Randolph Scott movies.First, there's an intelligent script by Russell Hughes, who wrote for some good radio shows like "Nightbeat" and Alan Ladd's "Box 13", as well as such films as Anthony Mann's "Last Frontier", Delmer Daves' "Jubal", and even the best of the giant-bug movies, "Them".Then, there's the look and feel of the film. Director Andre De Toth and his great cinematographer Bert Glennon (who had done remarkable work with the likes of Josef von Sternberg and John Ford) light and shoot for realism and emotional impact. Glennon had also shot "Man Behind the Gun" (available on the flip side of this DVD), so I suppose director Felix Feist could be blamed for that film's phony-looking stage sets. Here, in "Thunder... ", a barroom scene looks like it was shot in a real barroom (foreshadowing Clint Eastwood's "natural lighting" technique by decades) and exteriors are shot outdoors. To be fair, the Feist film may have had budget or producer issues, but given that film's potential (dealing with water rights, corrupt politicians, the possible secession of southern California, even the semi-legendary Joaquin Murrietta as a supporting character) it still seems like a typical, entertaining, 40's-style B-movie. "Thunder...", released the same year, 1953, seems more forward-looking, more compelling, more of the age of the "adult" Westerns, even though the literally flag-waving ending with its narrative paean to the great state of Texas kind of pulls us back to B-movie-land. 
tt0046426; Thunder Over The Plains is directed by AndrA© De Toth and written by Russell S. Hughes. It stars Randolph Scott, Lex Barker, Phyllis Kirk, Charles McGraw, Henry Hull & Elisha Cook Jr. Filmed in WarnerColor the exterior photography is by Bert Glennon at the Warner Ranch in Calabasas, and David Buttolph scores the music.It's 1869, and Texas is still not part of the Union. Carpetbaggers rule the state and criminal activity is high. Captain Porter (Scott), a proud Texan himself, finds he has to carry out orders against his own countrymen. When a man in town is murdered in cold blood, suspicion falls on rogue cowboy Ben Westman (McGraw), but Porter believes he's innocent and strikes a deal to bring him in for a fair trial. However, this sets off a chain of events that leads to Porter himself becoming a wanted man.Knowing direction, fine acting and a darn good script, all make Thunder Over The Plains essential viewing for the 50s Western fan. The bonus, aside from the impressive support cast, is the story itself. This was a troubled time, a time when only two states were not yet accepted back into the Union post the Civil War. Toth and Hughes paint a murky town, one of corruption, tax oppression and shifty shenanigans. There's even room in the story for strains on the family home of Porter and an attempt at adultery. Throw in the nice colour and scenery, pace it briskly with enjoyable action set-pieces (the shoot out at the end is familiar but excellently done), and it's a fictionalised winner. 7/10 
tt0046426; In post Civil War Texas, an Army captain is charged with bringing in an outlaw who has become a legend for taking on the Carpetbaggers. It begins and ends with hokey narration, but in between there is a fairly interesting story, helped by nice color cinematography. Scott is his usual solid self as the captain. McGraw plays the outlaw, but it is Barker (coming off his final Tarzan movie) as another Army captain that is the real villain here. Kirk does well as Scott's understanding wife. It's not up to the level of Scott's later Westerns with Budd Boetticher, but it's competently directed by de Toth. The final gunfight is too drawn out and somewhat anti-climactic. 
tt0046426; During reconstruction, Texas-born Army Captain Randolph Scott is torn between duty and his fellow Texans (including a young Fess Parker), who are in a life-or-death struggle against corrupt officials and ruthless carpetbaggers. Meanwhile, slimy officer Lex Barker gets a little too close to Scott's wife.Thunder Over The Plains sags just a bit in the middle, but has great production values and is fairly ambitious for a 1950's B-western, with some pretty complex characters. The cinematography and direction by Andre De Toth are excellent.Elisha Cooke Jr. is pretty good as a sniveling tax collector. Lex Barker's character is especially vile, kind of a surprise considering the times in which this was made and the fact that Barker is so handsome and all-American looking! 
tt0046426; Randolph Scott plays it perfectly straight as a post-war captain in the Union Army, stationed in Texas and a Southerner himself. He and his wife, Phyllis Kirk, are uncomfortable with their duties. Scott is supposed to protect the civilian authorities from the depredations of a gang led by Charles McGraw. But the civilians -- the wide-eyed and trembling Elisha Cook, Jr., and his dominant partner, the sneering and treacherous Hugh Sanders -- are worse than the gang. They overtax the locals, buy cotton for one tenth what they sell it for after they ship it to New York. For Scott, this is known as "role conflict," when a person is caught between two non-concordant roles -- loyal Texan and loyal Army officer. For the South, this is known as "reconstruction."Nobody knows how Lincoln might have handled reconstruction since he was assassinated at the end of the war. (He'd said the Southern states would be welcomed back into the union "as if they'd never left.") His successor, Andrew Johnson, was an unregenerate racist and a barely literate ex tailor who mismanaged the deal as best he could. His earnest hope was that the white aristocrats of the South, being gentlemen, would reestablish order and the slaves, now free, would assume their accustomed place as subordinates and servants. It didn't work out. Reconstruction was a disaster and order was maintained by the presence of Army troops for years. Seven years after the year of this movie, 1869, Rutherford B. Hayes found himself in a controversy concerning the electoral college and the popular vote, and apparently made a deal to withdraw the Army from the Southern states in return for the presidency. For the next ninety years the South would remain solidly Democratic and segregated.It's in this historical context that the movie's particular interest lies. It's not just another Western with a good sheriff against a band of evil outlaws and cattle rustlers. The role conflict that Randolph Scott was in was very real and generated by political circumstances. No nonsense about who's the fastest draw around here.It's one of Scott's best performances, full of complexity. The villains are clearly identified -- Cook and Brand, that scurrilous duo of miscreants. The movie's sympathy is obviously with the native Texans, most of whom are men of principle, including the gang leader, McGraw. He holds up the shipment of that tainted cotton all right, but he doesn't keep it for himself. He evidently returns it to those who rightly own it or he burns it.Scott is joined by an arrogant officer, Lex Barker, who does everything wrong and who puts moves on Scott's wife. He's another unlikable villain. (You can always tell the villains because they have no sense of humor.) Lex Barker does not perform celluloid magic but he's stolid in the part. As Scott's wife, Phyllis Kirk must have been genuinely uncomfortable. Stuck out there on the Texas plains, with her elegant accent and aristocratic features. She must have wondered what life was all about, how to cope with it all, how to live in the unfolding moment. (Her birth name was not Kirk but Kierkegaard.) It has its Western conventions but it's an attempt at a serious movie about a serious subject and Scott handles it well. 
tt0046426; The Civil War has ended and 1869 Texas is not unlike a powder keg with a short fuse. Those that can farm or grow cotton are forced out of their homes and off of their ranches by greedy carpetbaggers from the north. Captain David Porter(Randolph Scott)has a hard time with his loyalties being forced to witness carpetbaggers hiding under the legal protection of the Union Army of Occupation. A Texas patriot Ben Westman(Charles McGraw)is framed on a murder charge and Porter is under fire for letting his real allegiance be known. Westman's followers do their best to steal back what the carpetbaggers have taken by corrupt law of the land. Meanwhile a younger Captain Hodges(Lex Barker)is trying to put the moves on Porter's wife(Phyllis Kirk), who feels she has suffered loneliness much too long. Scott is at his stoic best, while Elisha Cook Jr. and Hugh Sanders fill the role of villains. Also in the cast: Lane Chandler, Fess Parker and Henry Hull. 
tt1517506; I've been a horror fan since childhood, and werewolves movies are so few so when a new title is out there, I try to watch it as soon as possible. But what a disappointment with this one. At the first ten minutes I realized that this wasn't a real horror movie, well, horror comedy is OK when you got the right tone, but here we got a mix of too much elements, comedy, suspense, fairy tale, horror?, folklore, and a very long etc. The problem is the mix, this movie goes nowhere, it doesn't have identity and the cocktail finally is way too tasteless. Not to mention the werewolves CGI that looks like play station 1. Well, at least it doesn't bore you, a few laughs over here and there, but I'll be waiting for a new "real" wolf man movie. 
tt1517506; Joseph CA´tA© is your typical "courreur des bois" (or wood runner), a scallywag who lives outside the boundaries of the law, the church, and social rules. We are introduced to him as he is about to get executed for innumerable petty crimes. Joseph escapes and manages to disguise himself by donning the garb of a dead Jesuit priest found in a ditch. Unknowingly, he has usurped the identity of PA¨re Brindamour, a famous werewolf slayer. As he arrives in a village with the original intent of simply getting food and rest, he starts realizing that he's not the only visitor in the area as a werewolf kills one of his new acquaintances. People quickly look up to him, the unfortunate impostor, to rid the area of the beast (or beasts!).Believe it or not, I've quite enjoyed this movie over the remake of the Wolfman (2010). Sure, the effects are not as good (the werewolf will sometimes look like it's stuck in a cross-over between a video-game and a movie- but is still quite effective in any scene where he isn't seen in harsh light). This movie had at least one good jump scene that got most of the audience scream in surprise. And most of all, it's another wonderful blend of humor and horror put together. Those familiar with French-Canadian lore will notice the filmmakers tried to stay away from the religious explanation for the werewolf being (tradition has it that if someone hasn't gone to mass in 7 years, he becomes a werewolf), but they also did a nice job of steering away from the traditional Hollywood explanation too (though you might raise an eyebrow...)The acting is good, the atmosphere is creepy, the jokes work- the jumps as well. It's obviously not Oscar material, but it's still a fun romp in a new genre of movie never seen in Quebec before, a period-piece horror film. All in all, this movie should make it in the top ten of anybody's favourite werewolf movies. 
tt1517506; This movie wants to be as diversified as possible but it takes too many bits and parts of almost every style. Some historical and folklore influences here, some spooky horror movie inspirations over there, a little bit of the Quebecker's typical comedy style in here, some little pieces of a classical adventure movie without forgetting some fantasy or fairy tale allusions brought to us in a tale teller's style, another bit of suspense, then a bit of a classical romance or love story... In the beginning, you could really get confused with all these influences. I really asked myself in the first thirty minutes: what's this movie? A comedy movie? An adventure movie? A semi-historical movie? A horror movie? Well, the movie takes bits and parts of everything but it isn't really into some style for real. We have a big identity problem here and this potpourri of styles isn't really good for the dynamic and tension of the film. But at least, it makes this movie somehow unpredictable and kind of unique. I think this is really the first serious werewolf movie that has ever been done in Quebec and it doesn't copy the usual Hollywood clichA©s or the classical pioneer stories. The movie has its own identity and it is sympathetic.This "unstraight" movie isn't a bad one at all. The movie shows us many breathtaking landscapes. The movie presents many interesting historical personalities, cities and behaviours. The actors are all doing at least a very solid job and many famous Quebeckers play in this movie once again. The twists and the script are not that surprising or shocking but at least funny and somehow original.If you want to see a movie with a quite huge variety of styles, a unique atmosphere and the typical solid and charming Quebecker style of filming and acting, you will at least get a very entertaining and somehow original movie. If you are looking for an intense werewolf movie or horror film, you will probably not get what you are waiting for. This movie is not very twisted or profound, but it is clear from the beginning on that the actors and directors don't take themselves that serious. You will get at least a very entertaining and charming movie but not a masterpiece about which you will think about for a long while. The movie is worth to be seen once but it is not worth buying the upcoming DVD in the future. 
tt1517506; This is not really a horror movie. If you are watching this because you are into frightening suspense horror with tons of blood and gore and mythology, than this is probably not for you.The werewolves could have easily been replaced with some non super natural cause, e.g. a real wolf or serial killers. That's not a bad thing, because this movie is not a mythology driven horror shocker, but more of a character driven road movie following an escaped criminal, who hides on some farm far out. And then the killing starts...What made me like this movie, it was never boring and the characters actually did somewhat plausibly things for people in rural Quebec in 1665. And did not do clichA© "stupid" things, people in "real" horror movies do.The few special effects where better B-Movie quality and you should see this movie as a very good B-Movie.Spoiler ahead!My favorite line in the movie is about this (saw the German version)Nun (to girls, werewolf is about to attack): Pray! Pray!One of the girls: No! Grab something and throw yourselves on him! 
tt1517506; This is a light french horror movie. Spiked with humor throughout and a charismatic lead. It may not explain a lot (which can be considered either good or bad, depending on ones taste), but it does show a few things (though it is not too gory or anything of course). The suave way of the main character will either find you excited, happy and eager or numb altogether.I watched it at a Festival and really liked it. Not without its flaws of course, but as lightweight entertainment it does work very well. The story is easy to follow and might be predictable to anyone who's seen a few of those movies. If that doesn't put you off the fun, then enjoy 
tt1517506; Canadian werewolf film with a historical setting, Quebec, New France, 1665, The Hair of the Beast tells the story of young man, the good-hearted petty thief type, caught in the middle of a creature hunt saga led by a specialist in lycanthropy, a priest, Father Brind'amour. When our anti-hero, the thief, gets mistaken as Brind'amour, a series of adventures start to unroll in the wild beautiful countryside of Quebec. The film goes back and forth between comedy and drama, and successfully manages to avoid being too trivial or too serious. There's a decent amount of blood and guts but most of the time the movie focuses on the lighter tones. It's nothing special but I enjoyed it, reminded me of Brotherhood of the Wolf but that one took itself too seriously, instead, The Hair of the Beast never ceases to discretely mock his protagonists, and intended or not, the werewolves themselves are actually looking like extra hairy overgrown pups. They're vicious alright, but the CGI effects fail to capture that aspect in their appearance. But it doesn't make a big difference in the economy of the film because they're actually fully revealed at the end and until then the occasional clawed paw or the mysterious shape quickly sweeping the foreground are enough elements to insert the necessary amount of tension. Though not at high standards, the film delivers a nicely woven creature tale set in a beautiful woodland in a time when horror figures of folk legends were actually feared and believed as real 
tt0102043;  This is a movie with cult potential.Brian Thompson(in a rare leading role.)is the misogynistic soldier of fortune called on to lead an army of seven beautiful fashion models/ mercenaries to rescue an imprisoned leader from  a despotic regime.Good supporting cast in the shape of the late Oliver Reed and Jose Ferrar.It also features a gay kiss scene(of sorts) between Reed and Thompson!The dialogue is cliched, but the action is good.The girls look as if they escaped from a Robert Palmer video.Good voyeuristic fun!  
tt0102043;  I love these old action movies with bad actors and all the cliches, they're simply just so funny. If you liked showdown in little tokyo or any of Arnolds action movies, then you'll like this :) Too bad this one wasn't shown in cinemas and I had to rent the DVD. So if you have a good sounds system and a thing for old action movies, then GET THIS ONE!!! 
tt0102043; There's plenty of eye-candy here (though Mastorakis had the brilliant idea to kill off the gorgeous babe Barbara Lee Alexander halfway through), and Brian Thomson gives a funny performance, playing the usual "macho" stereotype and spoofing it at the same time. As an action movie, however, "Hired to Kill" is unpretentious but absurd: there is no real action until the last 30 minutes...then there is one of those "Commando"-type endings where the inept bad guys are essentially just stunt men waiting for their cue to "die". The plot is totally anachronistic - brave commandos (preferably American) rescuing a revolutionary leader and overthrowing the local dictator of some banana republic - but the funny part is that, because the film was shot in Corfu, Greece, it was impossible to set it in the usual unnamed Latin American banana republic, so Mastorakis created a fictional Mediterranean country named Cypra (!!!). Hmmm, I wonder which real country's name he was trying oh-so-subtly to avoid...By the way, is this the official low point of Oliver Reed's career? (probably not) (*1/2) 
tt0102043; I love this director. First, he gave us Island of Death, an utterly outrageous and hilarious piece of video nasty trash. Then, after thinking that was the only film he'd ever made, I found myself watching Nightmare at Noon, a Crazies style film with plenty of action and hoots. Now, I've sat through Hired to Kill, and although it's not as good as those two films, it still has plenty of daftness to keep my attention.Brian Thompson is one of those secret service types hired to infiltrate a despotic country and overthrow dictator Oliver Reed, but not just that, he's got to do it posing as a gay fashion designer with an entourage of special forces beauties posing as models. So it's kind of like the dirty dozen remade by Vogue magazine, including the obligatory training scene, and the obligatory fashion model shoot. No wonder Oliver Reed looks perplexed (and a little bit toasted in a couple of scenes).This is all pretty fun stuff, but there's a lack of action for the first hour or so. Still, there's the standout scene where Oliver Reed checks whether or not Thompson is actually gay or not which had me in stitches. I'm not even sure Reed was expecting to be kissed by Thompson because his surprise seems pretty genuine. Great stuff. 
tt0102043; No one can say Frank Ryan (Thompson) isn't awesome. As a badass mercenary, he plays by his own rules. But when Thomas (Kennedy) approaches the hulking brute with a new assignment, at first he's wary. He must travel to the small country of Cypra and rescue a political prisoner named Rallis (Ferrer). But in order to do this, he must pretend to be a gay fashion designer and have a retinue of seven fashion models. Did you think there would be another way to get that job done? This initially chaps Ryan's hide, as he's an ultra-macho warrior who "doesn't like working with women". But these aren't ordinary women, they're all specially trained in the fighting arts. The only real obstacle standing in their way is the president of Cypra, one Michael Bartos (Reed) and his goons. Will Ryan and his lethal ladies be able to extract the prisoner and complete their mission? Find out todayÂ It was nice to see fan-favorite Brian Thompson as the main hero for once. He usually plays the baddie, and he deserves a starring role like this. He gets a great intro to his character, doing something to a ringing phone that we've all fantasized about doing at one time or another. But that's about it for character development for Frank Ryan, all we need to know is that he's a grizzled, tanktop-wearing, musclebound belligerent jackass/hero. But how could Thompson be a villain this time around, when the great Oliver Reed fills the role with aplomb? Sure, Reed's absurd, bushy mustache makes him look like a cross between David Crosby and a walrus, but it's all part of the fun. Hired to Kill isn't that dissimilar from another "Oliver Reed hitting the skids" movie, Rage to Kill (1988). Maybe he demanded only to be in "Â to Kill" movies to cap off his career.Jose Ferrer doesn't do that much, and George Kennedy wears some cool glasses. You've got to hand it to director Mastorakis. He can usually corral together a bunch of B-stars like this and create a product perfect for the VHS market of the day. Kennedy also worked with Mastorakis on Nightmare at Noon (1988), as you may remember. Essentially, Hired to Kill is a non-South America-set El Presidente movie, and of course Ryan has to assemble a team, and naturally there's a training sequence. But those time-honored classic items are filled with babes. The scenario is reminiscent of Hell Squad (1986), but just call it the "fem-spendables".So while there are plenty of talky bits in the middle, it all comes to a nice, Red Scorpion (1988)-like climax (Thompson even resembles Dolph at times), and there is some classic un-PC dialogue. Plus he sits down while shirtlessly shooting a machine gun and wearing sunglasses. Usually it's some maniac standing and screaming while doing that. Thompson adds some casual cool to his murderous rage. Featuring the song "Do It For the Money" by Thomas Marolda, which is very similar to Deion Sanders' "Must Be the Money" of a few years later (could it be that "Neon Deion" is a fan of this movie?) Hired to Kill does get a little dull at times, but the stars, especially Thompson, and the eye candy, keep it afloat. 
tt0102043; What can I say? This film has EVERYTHING! But most importantly, it has Brian Thompson, whose acting skills stand in good stead with the brilliance of Oliver Reed and George Kennedy... but for different reasons. His ability to make every line he utters seem completely unbelievable is sheer genius, one of my favourites being "Kiss Mother For Me!" It's impossible to dislike this film, but you can't watch it like you would watch any other film. You have to watch this knowing that what you're about to watch is utter balls, but at the same time it is THE balls! I implore you to watch this film, if only for the Oliver Reed and Brian Thompson kissing scene (yes, you read correctly). Oh, and also for the song "Doing It For The Money" that plays throughout the film. It's a bloody classic! WATCH IT!!! 
tt0102043; Given his muscular frame and intense look, the always excellent Brian Thompson is usually found typecast in movies as the bad guy (Cobra and Mortal Kombat:Annihilation to name but two instances) so it came as a very pleasant and refreshing change to see him given the chance to play the hero role in this film.In it he plays Frank Ryan, a highly trained mercenary who is hired by a shady organisation (headed by George Kennedy) to rescue an imprisoned rebel leader from a (fictitious) country called Cypra, somewhere in the middle east.Sounds straight forward? Well that's what Ryan thinks at first to, fully expecting to go in with his guns a blazing to get the job done. However, the mission stipulates a more subtle approach and some undercover work involving of all things, a modelling agency! Much to his chagrin, Ryan is given the new identity of a gay fashion designer, whilst his beautiful female 'models' are in fact, recruited mostly from maximum security jails for their special (and very deadly) skills which Ryan hones to even deadlier perfection through a rigorous and brutal training regime.With his new soldiers now ready for action, Ryan takes them to Cypra, where they are greeted by the host, the head of the government's security services and acting leader (Oliver Reed sporting his mighty moustache!) for an exclusive fashion shoot.Of course, much action ensues with our hero's eventually locating their intended target to free him....but is this the real mission objective? Throw in a bit of double crossing, and at least not all of our band of liberators making it back home safely....So on to the quality of the film itself now, Well the good news is that Thompson certainly makes the most of his role as the chauvinistic, tough as nails hard man with a secret soft heart. The ladies to look lovely whilst simultaneously handling the action scenes well and it's always fun to watch the late, great Oliver Reed in action.The bad news is that very sadly, there just isn't nearly enough of the aforementioned action to enthral most action fans.Still, what there is, is admittedly handled with some not inconsiderable flair by directors Nico Mastorakis and Peter Rader including some nice BIG explosions during the climax and some great helicopter stunt work. I also really enjoyed the very end of this, wherein one of the films protagonists gets their just desserts in a very fitting way.Overall then, certainly not a bad film by any means, but it's also certainly not the all out action trailer that Brian Thompson deserves to headline. Come on Hollywood, give this actor some more roles!As a final note: Watch out for the hilarious scene where Oliver Reed's character grabs Thompson by the gonads to check if he's genuinely homosexual. Thompson, looking somewhat shocked, has to quickly act his part by kissing him! 
tt0102043; ...with a little help from his "friends," of course!"Hired to Kill" is about a prisoner who, after he gets out of jail "free" (LOL another Monopoly joke here!), he hires a bunch of really beautiful women who, well, help the poor rotting man do bad things! Now this is excitement! No, I would never live life like this! But, what I am saying is, this movie is exciting because of the plot, the action, the babes...what else could you possibly want in a manly movie?I say, "Hired to Kill" is such an excellent "escape from prison" type of movie. It may not be like "The Rock," but it's still that good! I give this film ten stars for the action, the adventure, the suspense, the girls, and anything else that this movie offers! Have some fun with "Hired to Kill" tonight! 
tt0075834; Those expecting a sleazy, gory late entry in the "giallo" cycle of Italian cinema might be let down at THE PYJAMA GIRL CASE, but the film is actually a superb murder mystery, a fascinating character study, a police procedural, and a visually striking experience. Perhaps it's best to say that it was "inspired by a true story," since much liberty is taken with the original Australian case on which the film is based (and the Blue Underground DVD has as an extra an interview with investigative Australian author Richard Evans, who wrote a book about the real case from the 1930's). Ray Milland stars as a retired detective who spends time most of his time in his greenhouse (is this an allusion to the Columbo episode where Milland was into gardening?) but is brought out of retirement by a baffling case where an unknown corpse is found charred and decayed in an abandoned car on a beach. The police must first find who the woman is before finding who killed her. All the while as this story is being told we are following a second plot which I won't divulge here. At about the mid-point it seems as though the film might be nearly over, but it takes another turn and the chronologies of the stories become clear. As a regular watcher and reader of murder mysteries, the red herring characters were clear to me, the identity of the victim was no surprise, and the solution to the crime was not as much of a surprise as other IMDb reviews seem to think. However, I was riveted the way I am in a good Columbo episode thinking about the HOW and the WHY of the crime, and the clever way in which the various threads are tied together. Milland is, as always, superb, bringing many interesting quirks to the character of Thompson the retired detective. Michele Placido is impressive as the Italian immigrant waiter who is a major player in the parallel story, and Mel Ferrer is his usual suave self as a Professor who is having an affair with Placido's wife, who is played by the lovely Dalila Di Lazzaro. Fortunately, Milland and Ferrer provide their own voices. Howard Ross is also memorable as a vain and brutal German who is also having an affair with Dalila. While Riz Ortalani's music is largely the thumping electric euro-funk one expects in a 1977 film, it's much more subtle than, say, a soundtrack by Goblin, and two songs by Amanda Lear (my wife asked me "is that Nico?") are haunting and perfect, although many will find themselves initially put off by her singing. I don't think I can get the main song of hers out of my head. I had always considered buying a pan-and-scan VHS of this, but I'm glad I waited for the new and beautiful widescreen DVD. The Australian locations for the film as surprising and shot in an unexpected way that is fresh and makes the background an important character. I've been waiting to see this for two decades, and while it wasn't exactly what I was expecting, I was completely satisfied by it and watched it twice the day I bought it. Mystery fans and those into 70's Italian genre films should not miss it. However, don't expect the level of sex and violence you're usually provided in such films. 
tt0075834;  A detective searches for the identity and killer of a young woman found dead on the beach, wearing only a pair of yellow pajamas, meanwhile, a friend of the dead woman sets off on the road to avoid being the next victim. That's not all there is, but the central idea behind this film's construction is so brilliant I can't say any more. The end is such a surprise that you'll either be blown away or feel ripped off. It plays with story construction in a way I've never seen done before, one that's begging to be copied by some high-profile indie here in the US. Film school buffs will dig it and find a lot to argue about, others might be confused or annoyed. Ray Milland is good but kind of decrepit-looking, here in the evening of his career, the chief culprits in this film are the pop songs that they repeat endlessly (though catchy). I'd love to see reactions to this one, I recommend it highly. 
tt0075834; Stylish murder mystery from director Flavio Mogherini, "The Pyjama Girl Case" is based on a true crime that took place in Australia in the 1930's. The Sydney location lensing by cinematographers RaAol Artigot and Carlo Carlini takes full advantage of the city's magnificent vistas and gives the film a sunny, deceptive tone. Told in flashback, Ray Milland, a retired cop, gets back to work after the burned and bludgeoned body of a young woman (Dalila Di Lazzaro) is found on a beach. The film's focus is on the Di Lazzaro character, a listless slut who spent her life manipulating a variety of men including her husband and older lover (Mel Ferrer). The gorgeous Di Lazzaro appears naked in a number of scenes (she has a superb body) and there is a sleazy, voyeuristic vibe throughout. The actress takes on two sweaty Mexicans in one murky sex scene and is adequately beaten about in an impressive set-up in a caravan as the camera circles the vehicle. Riz Ortolani delivers a striking, upbeat score, and Australian actor Rod Mullinar (who once played TV tough guy 'Ryan') co-stars as a straight-shooting cop. Unfortunately, he is shabbily dubbed. Though the film sags badly in the center for close to a half hour, it redeems itself with a strong and nasty climax. 
tt0075834; Often referred to as a giallo, The Pyjama Girl Case (or The Girl in the Yellow Pajamas) is one of the more unique entries into the sub-genre. Frankly, it's not really much of a giallo in my eyes. I look at it as more of a dramatic murder mystery with some underlying splashes of the yellow paint.In Sydney, a young girl discovers the charred remains of a woman in an old car on the beach. The woman's face is too badly burned for the police to make a proper identification. The case is given to an inspector by the name of Ramsey, though retired Inspector Thompson insists on getting involved as well much to Ramsey's dismay. While we watch their investigation unfold, we are also treated to an alternate story involving a sexually troubled young woman who has gotten herself involved with three different men. What's the connection? Ray Milland is solid as the retired Thompson, and he delivers a few laughs to boot. He has a distaste for the methods that police have began using since his time on the force, and it's quite entertaining to watch his sense of glee whenever he's crowding Ramsey's space. Ramsey is a pretty unlikable guy too. He refuses to listen to Thompson's logical reasoning, and he tries his best to find a scapegoat as quickly as he can. Caring more about getting credit and going on a nice vacation as soon as possible, Ramsey is behind Thompson every step of the way.On the alternate end of the spectrum, Dalila Di Lazzaro successfully captures the very troubled and torn nature of her character, Glenda. She spends her time between a wealthy doctor (Mel Ferrer) and a German factory employee (Howard Ross), both of whom she uses for meaningless sex. Through Roy, the German, she meets Antonio, a Polish waiter with a seemingly soft and sensitive nature. They fall for each other and marry, but the marriage is a very troubled one as Glenda, starved for both intimacy and an emotional connection, becomes very bored with the shy natured Antonio. This in turn sets off his jealous tendencies. As Antonio, I think Michele Placido gives what is perhaps the film's best performance. He's just as troubled as his wife, and his emotional outbursts seem genuine and heartfelt.The film's unique narrative is constructed in an effective manner as we bounce back and forth not only between stories, but in time as well. Director Mogherini also throws in some wonderful pieces of misdirection throughout the alternating story lines. Carlo Carlini's cinematography is splendid. Sydney is a lovely city, and Carlini milks it for all it's worth, delivering some striking shots and images. Mogherini's film is further complimented by some rather arty directorial flourishes. One of my favorite sequences has tons of people in trance-like states shuffling around a tank containing the woman's body, the police hoping someone will be able to identify her. The scene plays to Riz Ortolani's beautifully haunting score, and has a very surreal, detached feel to it. It's a masterfully crafted little sequence.Overall, while a stylish film, The Pyjama Girl Case is mainly about the characters. It's a very character driven story with a real emotional punch to it, something I wasn't expecting when I first gave it a go. I have zero reservations about recommending this to fans of gialli and Eurohorror in general. Just don't go in expecting your typical giallo. 
tt0075834; Based on a true story from 1930, The Pyjama Girl Case is a difficult movie to categorize. It is more often than not considered an Italian Giallo, but is it really a Giallo? Even though I've included it on my Top 50 Giallo list, The Pyjama Girl Case differs so much from the model that I'm not sure this label is accurate. There is no black-gloved, masked killer. There is no string of over-the-top murders. The Pyjama Girl Case lacks the stylish look of most Gialli. And, there is no sense of dread or real tension usually associated with the genre. So, why do I include The Pyjama Girl Case on my list of favorite Gialli Â<U+0096> this is not a good answer, but I do it because everyone else does.If it's not a real Giallo, then what is The Pyjama Girl Case? I would say it best fits in the drama category with touches of a police procedural thrown in for good measure. The Pyjama Girl Case is the story of a mysterious half-burned body found in an abandoned car on a beach. In addition to being burned, the body also shows signs of severe head trauma and a bullet through the neck. The case is particularly interesting to Inspector Thompson (Ray Milland), a retired detective wanting one last case to investigate. Using outdated techniques and very few clues, he is determined to find the killer before he rides off into the sunset. I disagree with a lot of what I've read and feel Milland is one of the films weak points. His crotchety old man routine is rather predictable. His Inspector Thompson is the clichA© for the "non-conforming just because I'm old" type character.The Pyjama Girl Case's structure can be off-putting to some. In addition to the police investigation, the film also features a concurrent look at the events leading up to the girl's death. It can be confusing at first because of the uncertainty of what's going on, who these people are, and how they relate to each other. But everything works out in the end and all the pieces fall into place. The girl's story is a tragic one. Her life is a series of miserable events (a bad marriage, a miscarriage, a string of unfulfilling relationships, etc.) all leading to her brutal murder. The girl is played by Dallia Di Lazzaro in a very memorable and believable performance. She gives her character a sense of depth not often found in Italian movies of this sort. She is easily the highlight of the movie for me. 
tt0075834;  This film was confusing when I watched it, however, all was revealed at the end. Suddenly, everything fell into place and it seems that this films' directional technique was employed years later by directors like Tarintino and Ritchie.The film doesn't run in the standard order of things, making it stand out for it's time. A good screenplay, good acting all round and not bad by any movie viewers standards.  
tt0075834; Quite an oddity this and none the worse for that. So late into the seventies and set in Sydney, Australia, this was never going to be in any way a standard giallo and in truth it is more a romantic thriller with giallo overtones. This did not start well for me with the opening song and I never really appreciated the soundtrack throughout which I found to be rather grating. Things didn't get better with the appearance of a seemingly over acting Ray Milland but gradually it began to win me over until it seemed Milland was in some other film. Calming down again, helped by the constant on screen smouldering of Dalila Di Lazzaro, I allowed the film to wash over me and presto a most unusual film with most original structure reveals itself. It's not perfect but give this one a chance to surprise. 
tt0075834; A young girl and her older brother find a body of a young woman dressed in yellow pyjamas on a Sydney beach. So a retired inspector comes out of retirement to help out the police with their investigation. But he sees that the modern methods of police work aren't getting results and when they make their mind up there's no swaying it. So Inspector Thompson decides to start his own case on the side using his own methods.'The Girl in the Yellow Pyjamas' is a reasonably modest Italian/Spanish giallo that does construct itself around some striking fixtures and an involving plot. A quick note, during the opening proceedings it's labelled that the actual story is supposedly based on true facts with the names of those involved changed. I'm not what you call an expert of this sub-genre, as I've only come across oh so few, so you can say I'm fairly new to it all. Thinking that man I've got to see more gialli, I notice that this was playing on telly one night and I thought that it isn't one to pass by. Form what I saw, I definitely had an above average time with this giallo piece. It was a bit confusing at first glance, but as you keep on following the story it all comes together rather neatly, without any real hiccups. I'll admit when watching it I was kind of thinking is this actually going to go anywhere or is it just going lose its way. As I thought some sequences were rather pointless to this whole investigation with the mystery playing second fiddle to the central drama position, but the structure of the story, which I've never come across before works out in the bigger picture. Well I have, but definitely not edited in this way. So don't be fooled like I was that most of the sub-plots were not contributing to the case, but they most definitely are and that's proved so, in the last half-an-hour.The story structure comes into its own by being truly ambitious, which it could make or break the film, but actually I thought it was quite ingenious and refreshing. The plot does more than enough to throw you off course with some surprising knock offs. Like a reviewer had already mentioned there's so much going on in a matter time that it does become crowded with characters coming and going. Too many characters can spoil the brew, but this time it was easily overcome. Throughout the feature we get very moody and drawn out sequences that has of touch of pretentiousness to it, but still it's hard to take your eyes off it.Director Flavio Mogherini makes the most out of the impeccable location cinematography. The Sydney backdrop is easy on the eyes, but at times I just couldn't stop getting the sneaking impression that they seem to forget they were shooting a film. I say that because excessively it felt like there was more concern in the sights then developing any rhythm and plot. But in the long run I was wrong. Another factor that stabs away at you is the funky soundtrack that makes one real lasting impression. Which at times was a good thing, but also a bad thing. Moments it would be humming with irresistible ooze that breathed such silky elegance, but that wasn't always the case with some high-strung tunes that were tiresomely wretched. The repetitiveness too didn't help either. Mogherini creates some spots of brilliance amongst some odd and arty images that do make headway, like the tasteless scene involving a dead body and glass case and the moment when we discover the dead body. The pacing is stodgy but somehow your just transfixed to what's happening that it doesn't really matter, especially because it does pick up after the hour mark with an cleverly laid out climax that's more than a exceptional ending. The editing was executed to perfection, but the camera work is a bit unstable and lacking flash of style. The performances were that of high quality and Ray Milland as Inspector Thompson was leading the way. Dalila Di Lazzaro as Glenda Blythe was impressive too. What might be a turn off is that it might lack the violence and brutality, but not a sexually charged vibe. Though you might call it very sleazy. Overall, it a professionally done production.It might have its fair share of flaws, but this unique Giallo has a whole lot more lurking under the surface than what actually meets the eye. It's definitely worth tracking down if you're an enthusiast of the sub-genre. 
tt0075834; Ray Milland had a long career (1929-1985) and many roles, including his Oscar as Best Actor in Billy Wilder's Lost Weekend. He managed a couple of Italian films in the 70s, including this one.It is not a typical giallo, as the body count is very low. However, it does have a certain charm as a police procedural as they try to discover who killed the girl in the yellow pyjamas.Seeing Dalila Di Lazzaro certainly makes the film worthwhile, and you do see all of her as she romps with men and women (Vanessa Vitale, who was not bad herself.).Red herrings and surprises abound in a film that was shot in Sydney, and really looked good there. In fact, it was based upon a true story in Austrailia in the 30s.Good acting by Lazarro and Michele Placido, as well as a fine performance by Milland. 
tt0075834; This is one of those unusual films that doesn't seem that good at the time but only once the final parts of the puzzle click into place is it apparent that there might have been more to it than at first met the eye. The reason for this is because, unless I was seriously missing a trick, the flash-back scenes in this film are never actually sign-posted as such. As an audience we believe that the two threads to the story are happening simultaneously and will eventually converge. Well they do converge but once they do, they put a whole new perspective on one half of the story. Until you realize this, the film appears to have a sort of aimlessness to it, and you simply can't see where it's going. Once the structure is revealed, however, it makes you want to watch the film again with this in mind.The Pyjama Girl Case is marketed as a giallo, even going as far as to include the term in its original Italian title (the dead girl wears yellow (giallo) pyjamas). But although the film certainly displays some conventions of the genre, it's loosely a giallo at best. For one thing, this is based on a true story, and even though a healthy number of liberties have been taken in this presentation, it's still much more grounded in reality than is typical of the giallo sub-genre. The film often focuses on issues like prostitution and loneliness in a socially dramatic way that is completely alien to the more straight-ahead thriller approach of the giallo. This is certainly an atypical film, and for that it has to be given some credit.The true story of the Pyjama Girl Case is truly tragic and mysterious with all manner of dark undertones regarding the Australian justice system. If the material had been played straight it would have the potential for a great film. As it is, this Italian version of an Australian story is set decades later and includes a number of what-if scenarios. At times it exaggerates true elements to an almost psychotronic level, e.g. the scene where the dead woman's body is on display to the public Â<U+0096> the body was on display but certainly not in the bizarre way depicted in the movie!In summary, The Pyjama Girl Case is a true Australian story told in a semi-true Italian way in a semi-giallo style in a series of flash-backs that only become obvious as such by the end of the film. And if that sounds a bit weird, well I suppose that's because it is. This film isn't what you think it's going to be that's for sure. 
tt0240732; For all that criticise this move here, they've at least seen the movie in its entirety at that must tell you something about the movie. It's fairly well scripted and acted, but if you compare it to the best Hollywood movies you'll, of course find it lacking, but then so would most other movie be lacking IF you compare them to the best. Compare it to the median and you'll be pleasantly surprised. It's cool.No, what the movie does it portray a serious Biblical truth in a lively, relevant and most appealing way. It's not preachy, there's no cringe factor. Whatever it does, it'll get you thinking. And if only because of that, it is well worth seeing. But it does more. 
tt0240732; The Moment After is once again a Christian conception of what will happen here on earth when the believer types are suddenly whisked out of this plain of existence to another dimension. As there is as much speculation about these prophetic events and some out there hold that the Rapture is not even going to happen, the writer's imagination can run wild with possibilities.I don't think all that much imagination was put to use here though. The film focuses on two FBI agents, David A.R. White and Kevin Downes who are among the many checking out and filing all the missing person cases that have mushroomed all over the globe.Pretty soon though Downes and White are put on the trail of a messianic Jew played by Brad Heller who when the Rapture does occur suddenly decides he's the guy looking to convert his people. The New Testament does say that before the Second Coming all the Jews in the world will be converted. That makes him one dangerous fellow, especially to the forces of the world government who are not liking people like Heller. In fact Christians who didn't make the Rapture cut are following this guy as well.The Moment After is a sincere, but rather flat attempt offer a future vision of persecution of Christians for spreading the word. The people behind the film are evangelicals, down to the players who are veterans of the Christian film genre. It all gets done so often. In fact as evangelical tools they can be suspect because the speculation varies so that if they are continually shown at churches, Sunday Schools and such venues, I wonder if it doesn't confuse more than uplift. 
tt0240732; Who can stop this seemingly unstoppable end times merchandise bonanza? Bestselling books, comics, board games, movies, those tracts you find in bus station toilets, etc. It seems to be everywhere. And "The Moment After" is no exception. The film is about the "rapture" where all the Big Guy's followers get whisked off into the clouds and all non-followers are condemned to suffer. Sound like fun?Despite what the film is advertising, the film is about as uplifting as a weekend with leprosy. The visuals are somewhat interesting too. The New World Order general acts like he has a 2x4 rammed up his rear end, gritting his teeth, with veins popping in his forehead. It's pretty enchanting. And torn out of the classic soul-searching textbook, the film ends in a cookie cutter el fin complete with arms outstretched in prison and praising the Big J. Cue the Bible verses. No this film is not my cup of tea. And probably never will be. If I want to be preached at, I'll put up with one of those pesky Jehovah's Wittness' a-knocking at my door. 
tt0240732; It does start slow, The Moment After starts very slow and maintains this pace till the end. There is no wow moment, just a steady pace of people trying to find out what happened after Rapture has taken place. The movie is dull at first, but towards the end the message comes through and it strikes like a bullet, the words from the bible are spoken for a length reminding you to get your acts together for our Lord is coming soon.If you are looking for a fast paced movie where stories and lives are intertwined in an all classic way, with main plots and subplots, then this is not the movie for you, but if you are one with a patient soul that does not mind a movie that keeps you waiting for like an hour till the message comes, then have a taste of The Moment After.The Moment After is Written and directed by Wes Llewelyn. Due to its success, seven years later Wes Liewelyn directed (although didn't write) a sequel, named The Moment After 2: The Awakening (2006). This 1999 movie was a Crown Award Winner for Best Evangelistic Film and Best Drama film made for less than $250,000.The movie plot is about the incident after the rapture has taken place, with millions of people vanishing from the face of the earth turmoil has erupted. Two FBI agents Adam Riley (David White) and Charles Baker (Kevin Downes) are placed on the case to find out from people in an area who witnessed the vanishing of their loved ones.All to be later reassigned to go after a man who they believe is raising a paramilitary unit to fight the government.The things I liked about this movie are 1. the soundtrack, the ending song, Crystal Lewis Â<U+0096> People Get Ready Jesus is Comin was well placed it just suited the ending scene perfectly. 2. The cinematography, the level of the cinematography for this independent Christian film done in the 1999 was quite impressive, the camera shots weren't out of place. 3. The actors, the actors don't make you feel like there are paid peanuts for the job, they deliver the goods.The Moment After as I said is slow paced, and can come off as dull but in the end the message is passed. This movie is not in the leagues of Fireproof (2008), Facing the Giants (2006), Courageous (2011) or The Encounter (2010), It falls below all these movies but it is a good enough reminder of what is to come for the more matured mind.www.lagsreviews.com 
tt0240732;  This movie is not suppose to be like Hollywood movies. Some of those movies are good also. It is a specific evangelism tool. I have seen a lot of evangelism movies and this is my favorite so far. There are others that deal much more with the horror, but this one took it at another angle. It is still evangelistic, but that's what it is suppose to be. 
tt0240732; Unless you're a devout Christian and want your beliefs confirmed, avoid this like the plague. The dialogue makes the old Dragnet TV show seem lively and realistic, people have the most unbelievable reactions to incredible events and even within the Christian viewpoint, the movie simply makes no factual sense. In the "damning with faint praise" department, I guess it takes a talent of some kind to make a movie about a supernatural event like "the rapture" and manage to wring all tension, wonder and drama out of it.Truly awful movie that my wife rented thinking it was an actual sci-fi movie, rather than the di-fi (divinity fiction) it so clearly I and wanted to be. 
tt0240732; This movie picks up immediately after a phenomenon known in certain Christian circles as "the Rapture" has taken place. All true Christians have vanished from the face of the earth leaving all those left behind wondering what has happened to them. To get answers two FBI agents named "Adam Riley" (David A. R. White) and "Charles Baker" (Kevin Downes) are assigned the case. At the same time a young Jewish rabbi by the name of "Jacob Krause" (Brad Heller) also seeks some answers and after researching the Bible becomes one of the 144,000 witnesses for Christ as foretold in the book of Revelation. Meanwhile, life begins to change for the worse for everybody. Now, rather than disclose the rest of the story and risk ruining the film for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this is one of the better Christian movies dealing with this particular subject. While I don't believe it fully portrayed how difficult and chaotic things would be it does detail some of the prophesied events in an adequate manner. For example, in this particular movie the "mark of the Beast" is depicted as a small computer chip which is called a "B-chip" and is inserted in the right wrist. Be that as it may, I liked this film and I recommend it to all of those who enjoy movies in this genre. Above average. 
tt0240732; This is an independent film based on Biblical teachings. Some may rave against it, but hey, they don't like anything that is Christian. So why do you watch it and then gripe? David A.R. White does a very good job of acting in this film portraying an FBI agent that has to make his mind up for himself about what has happened following the disappearance of thousands of people. Brad Heller is a talented actor often overlooked. In this film he is a 'messenger' who leads God's children.In the sequel to this you see that it is the first film they made on their own. I feel they did a very good job. Way to go Downes, White, Heller and all the cast & crew. 
tt0240732; In a moment of time hundreds of thousands of people across America disappear in a flash . Scientists are baffled by this phenomenon but Christians believe the rapture has happened . Two FBI agents Baker and Riley try and make sense of the mass disappearance . Weeks after the event the increasing repressive American state is becoming more interested in a Rabbi who is now seen as a fugitive There's the bare bones of a good film in here somewhere . A flash and hundreds of thousands of Americans have ceased to exist . This calls for an investigation led by Mulder and Scully which would make a mighty fine episode of THE X FILES . Unfortunately any naughty thoughts about Dana Scully will have to be curtailed as will any type of critical thinking because this is a Christian movie . I don't mean it has a Christian subtext I mean it literally has Christian explanation for the events shown which sinks the film . Nigel Kneale used a very similar borrowing from the rapture in his 1979 QUATERMASS story but while that was about science versus faith with science winning in the end here faith wins out because ... well because .It'd be very easy to stick the boot in to THE MOMENT AFTER such as a character pulling out a bible and claiming " Everything in it is true " true that is except for God creating the Earth in seven days and the talking snake and Adam and Eve and everything else . Seeing as the hunted fugitive Jacob is a former Rabbi I'm a bit confused why he keeps referring to Christianity in such a knowledgeable manner since he's so recently converted . Yes Christianity is an off shoot of the Judiac religion as is Islam but that doesn't mean Jews view Jesus in the same way Christians do . They see Jesus as a mere prophet rather than the Son of God . I also wondered why Jacob needed to point out off camera and say " See this fir trees . They can't survive without God's love " .No they can't survive without photosynthesis . Try getting your nose out of the Bible or Talmud and read a book on basic plant biology JacobOh dearie me I starting to get a bit grumpy something I didn't mean to do but this sums up everything wrong about Christian films that leave no room at the Inn for either agnostics or atheists or even Deists . Nearly every scene revolves around the very real concept of God's existence which is a great pity because some of the ideas put forward are rather intriguing such as the American government putting micro-chips in people and the rise of an oppressive militia which would have somethingof an appeal to a mainstream secular audience . As it stands THE MOMENT AFTER only exists to spread the word to the converted 
tt0240732;  I have loved this movie from the moment I watched it the first time. It is an awesome witness for how things will be once we are out of here. The movie is thought provoking and well done. David White, Kevin Downes and Brad Heller are favorites--have seen other Christian movies they have been in.
