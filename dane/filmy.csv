tt0758746;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0758746/;Piatek 13.;2009;97 min; 22 May 2009 (Poland) ;Horror; A group of young adults set up tent near the abandoned summer camp where a series of gruesome murders are said to have taken place back in 1980. The perpetrator was a grieving mother, driven insane by the drowning of her child, Jason, whom she believed was neglected by the camp counselors. As legend has it, the last survivor of the attacks beheaded the woman. But then Jason came back, and now he is a vengeful and inexorable killer, wielding crossbows, swords, axes and other sharp instruments. The legend proves horribly true, as these campers quickly discover. Six months later, the brother of one of those campers distributes posters of his missing sister. The police believe she took off with her boyfriend, but he knows better. The brother crosses paths with an uptight young rich guy who is having his girlfriend and friends over at his parents' cabin. The brother ends up at the cabin himself just before his sister's attacker sets upon them all.                Written by J.

To boost ratings, her boss hires Mike Chadway, a local cable call-in host who promotes the ugly truth: sex is the only glue in a relationship, men can't change, and they only respond to women's looks.

Their pre-marital life did not include sex with each other. On the three day drive from New York to Miami Beach, where they plan on spending their honeymoon, Lenny begins to be bothered by every little thing about Lila, which makes him wonder whether he made a mistake in marrying her. His belief that the marriage is a mistake is strengthened when he meets university student Kelly Corcoran in Miami Beach. A beautiful blonde Midwesterner on vacation in Miami Beach with her wealthy WASP parents, flirtatious but at the same time somewhat standoffish Kelly leads Lenny on. Lenny does whatever he can to ditch Lila at every opportunity - which by circumstance is easy to do at the beginning - to spend time with Kelly, who he believes he was meant to be with for life. As Lenny pursues Kelly in the hopes of eventually marrying her, three things stand in his way: the fact that he is already married to Lila; whether or not Kelly feels the same way or if this liaison is just a vacation fling and game to her; and Mr. Corcoran, who hates everything about Lenny with every fiber of his being.              ;NA;NA;NA;Bill Ryan@Brendan Ryan;Matthew Aufdenspring@Mark Charpentier@John Davis@Ellen Dumouchel@Ted Field@Marc S.

Two women have the bad luck to fall for Yuddy. One is a quiet lass named Su Lizhen who works at a sports arena, while the other is a glitzy showgirl named Mimi.

William Blake travels to the extreme western frontiers of America sometime in the 2nd half of the 19th century. Lost and badly wounded, he encounters a very odd, outcast Native American, named "Nobody", who believes Blake is actually the dead English poet of the same name. The story, with Nobody's help, leads William Blake through situations that are in turn comical and violent. Contrary to his nature, circumstances transform Blake into a hunted outlaw, a killer, and a man whose physical existence is slowly slipping away.

Oliver is naturally a sullen man due to his growing up relationship with his parents (his mother who had a unique view on life) and watching his parents' cordial but somewhat distant relationship with each other, but is more so now because of his personal family loss. Oliver embarks on a relationship with Anna, a French actress. Oliver is hoping that his re-energized relationship with Hal following Georgia's death and Hal's new outlook on life during that time will show Oliver how to act in a loving relationship. After Georgia's death, Hal came out of the closet and began to live with a joie de vivre that did not exist before, which included an open relationship with a much younger man named Andy.

The initially friendly natives, who have no personal property concept, turn hostile after a 'theft' is 'punished' violently on the spot. During an armed exploration, Smith is captured, but spared when the chief's favorite daughter Pocahontas pleads for the stranger who soon becomes her lover and learns to love their naive 'savage' way of harmonious life. Ultimately he returns to the grim fort, which would starve hadn't she arranged for Indian generosity. Alas, each side soon brands their own lover a traitor, so she is banished and he flogged as introduction to slavish toiling. Changes turn again, leading Smith to accept a northern-more mission and anglicized Pocahontas, believing him dead, becoming the mother of aristocratic new lover John Rolfe's son. They'll meet again for a finale in England.

In 1890, a wealthy sheik invited an American, Frank T. Hopkins, and his horse to enter the race for the first time. During the course of his career, Hopkins was a cowboy and dispatch rider for the U.S. cavalry--and had once been billed as the greatest rider the West had ever known. The Sheik puts his claim to the test, pitting the American cowboy and his mustang, Hidalgo, against the world's greatest Arabian horses and Bedouin riders--some of whom are determined to prevent a foreigner from finishing the race. For Frank, the Ocean of Fire becomes not only a matter of pride and honor, but a race for his very survival as he and his horse attempt the impossible.                Written by Sujit R.

The feuding families become two warring New York City gangs- the white Jets led by Riff and the Puerto Rican Sharks, led by Bernardo. Their hatred escalates to a point where neither can coexist with any form of understanding. But when Riff's best friend (and former Jet) Tony and Bernardo's younger sister Maria meet at a dance, no one can do anything to stop their love. Maria and Tony begin meeting in secret, planning to run away. Then the Sharks and Jets plan a rumble under the highway - whoever wins gains control of the streets. Maria sends Tony to stop it, hoping it can end the violence. It goes terribly wrong, and before the lovers know what's happened, tragedy strikes and doesn't stop until the climactic and heartbreaking ending.

They board an airplane to Hong Kong. Hours later, they arrive in Hong Kong. On that night, they go to a Mah Jongg Parlor and go inside. Chad is approached by a blond haired woman who obviously thinks he's someone else, then a man who looks like Chad knocks Chad out cold. The man is Alex, and the woman is Alex's fiancée Danielle Wilde, who thought Chad was Alex. She, Chad, and Alex are all surprised to be told by Frank that Chad and Alex are brothers. Alex and Danielle have a hard time believing it. Frank explains that Paul supervised the construction of the Victoria Harbour Tunnel. Halfway into the project, Paul encountered financial problems, so he pulled in Nigel Griffith as an equity partner. Nigel got his money from a secret loan, courtesy of Hong Kong drug kingpin Raymond Zhang. When the tunnel was completed, and Paul's expertise was no longer needed, Nigel and Raymond had Paul and Katherine murdered by Moon's hit team. Chad and Alex were supposed to die, too, so they could not come back and claim what's rightfully theirs, what Nigel and Raymond stole from Paul, which was his business and the tunnel. Alex reluctantly believes Frank about this story, but Danielle continues to refuse to believe it. Alex, Chad, and Frank head out on Alex's boat. A few minutes after setting off, Alex's boat is approached by another boat. Alex allows three Chinese men aboard to look over a couple of cars that are on Alex's boat. As this is going on, two police boats approach. Alex throws the three Chinese men overboard, then while Alex heads to the boat's steering wheel, Chad and Frank send the cars overboard and blow the cars up. It seems that Alex is a smuggler. Later, Frank, Chad, Alex, and Danielle are at a restaurant, where Alex tells Chad and Frank that Danielle has been an employee of Nigel's company for the past 5 years. That's why Danielle refuses to believe Nigel's part in Paul and Katherine's murders. Chad takes a taxi cab out to the hotel where he and Frank have been staying, but before he can go inside, he is approached by a group of Chinese men who think he's Alex. Moon forces Chad into a car with Raymond, and taken to a boat yard. Raymond wants Alex's help in smuggling drugs, and he mistakenly has Moon place Chad in a cargo container and beat Chad up, trying to convince Alex to give in. Chad is then locked up in the container, taken downtown, and dumped out onto a street. After Chad is treated for his injuries, he and Alex decide that it's time to work together against Nigel and Raymond.              ;NA;NA;NA;Christopher Franke;Craig Baumgarten@Oliver Eberle@Donald Heitzer@Mario Kassar@Joel B.

He's killed on the US side of the border but it's clear that the bomb was planted on the Mexican side. As a result, Vargas delays his return to Mexico City where he has been mounting a case against the Grandi family crime and narcotics syndicate. Police Captain Hank Quinlan is in charge on the US side and he soon has a suspect, a Mexican named Manolo Sanchez.

He runs a small snack bar on the banks of the Han River and lives with his two sons, one daughter, and one granddaughter. The Parks seem to lead a quite ordinary and peaceful life, but maybe they are a bit poorer than the average Seoulite.

Nam-il is the youngest son, an unemployed grumbler, and daughter Nam-joo is an archery medalist and member of the national team.

Ill tempered Agent Woods is the secret service agent in charge of Luke. Woods is fired after mistreating Luke in front of the press. Woods is then replaced by former boxer Sam Simms, who won a boxing title in 1977. Sam is eager to take the job - even though no one else wants it. Everyone thinks that Luke is just a brat when the only thing Luke wants is to just fit in and be like every other kid at his school, the Georgetown Academy. Sam almost gets fired when Luke gets decked at school by school bully Rob MacArthur. This is when Sam decides to use his boxing expertise to teach Luke how to fight. Luke has his eyes on class-mate Katie Warren, but so does Rob. Katie agrees to go with Luke to an upcoming school dance, so Sam teaches Luke how to dance. Rob is also at the dance, but this time when Rob tries to deck Luke, Luke turns the tables and decks Rob. Sam is then fired for taking Luke to the dance without permission, although Luke had the permission of his parents, but secret service chief Morton didn't want Luke leaving the White House grounds while Luke's parents were on the campaign trail. Luke runs away anyway to meet a friend that he has been chatting on the internet with. The meeting is set to take place at a local mall where Luke discovers that his secret friend is a now psychotic Woods, who blames Luke for his firing and wants revenge on Luke, but not if Sam can help it.              ;NA;2;NA;David Newman;Michael Barnathan@Chris Columbus@Paula DuPré Pesmen@James Mulay@Mark Radcliffe@Richard Vane@Warren Zide;Arnold Schwarzenegger@Sinbad@Phil Hartman@Rita Wilson@Robert Conrad@Martin Mull@Jake Lloyd@James Belushi@E.J.

The story centers on an apartment building with a delicatessen on the ground floor. The owner of the eatery also owns the apartment building and he is in need of a new maintenance man since the original "mysteriously" disappeared. A former clown applies for the job and the butcher's intent is to have him work for a little while and then serve him to quirky tenants who pay the butcher in, of course, grain. The clown and butcher's daughter fall in love and she tries to foil her father's plans by contacting the "troglodytes", a grain eating sub-group of society who live entirely underground. The "trogs" are possibly the most sensible of the lot, as they see food as food and not money.

He dropped out of Harvard to become an inventor, he now with nine patents and six pending. He loves the US, but is disillusioned by what it has become in so many different facets. As such, he unilaterally decides to uproot his family - his wife who he affectionately calls "Mother", their two sons Charlie and Jerry, and their twin daughters April and Clover - from their comfortable New England life to move to the jungles of Central America, most specifically Mosquitia. There, he hopes to start from scratch to build a society closer to his own ideals - his utopia. He believes he is doing this not just for himself, but for his family, as he wants his children to learn from real life as opposed to from books. Allie will learn that he may have his own view of what he wants to achieve, but that there are external forces, both human and non-human, that may conspire against him. Outwardly, chief amongst his human obstacles is missionary, Reverend Spellgood, whose work Allie believes is solely narcissistic propaganda. In turn, Reverend Spellgood believes Allie is a communist. But what may be lurking underneath the surface as another obstacle is Allie's own family, who may ultimately rebel against something in which they had no input, especially as Allie has a policy of anyone being free to leave if they want, but be excommunicated from the family forever. Allie, too, will have to decide how far he will go to achieve his ultimate dream.              ;2;10;26;Maurice Jarre;David Bombyk@Edward S.

He only becomes flustered or angry at obtuse or offensive humans who try to disrupt his existence, or at troublesome gadgets, rodents, or insects. In most of his cartoons, he stumbles into a difficult situation and stoically endeavors to make the best of it. Episodes of this series feature three theatrical cartoons, two with the Pink Panther, and one featuring the Inspector, a cartoon version of the accident-prone, bumbling French detective, Inspector Clouseau, played in movies by Peter Sellers. The Inspector is often assisted by a Spanish gendarme, Sergeant Deux-Deux, and together they fallibly battle villains of all shapes and sizes in various parts of the world, always on the orders of the long-suffering Surete Commissioner.              ;NA;NA;4;Christophe Beck;Ira Shuman@Robert Simonds@Tracey Trench@Tim Hamilton@Aaron Wilder;Steve Martin@Kevin Kline@Jean Reno@Emily Mortimer@Henry Czerny@Kristin Chenoweth@Roger Rees@Beyoncé Knowles@Philip Goodwin@Henri Garcin@William Abadie@Daniel Sauli@Jean Dell@Anna Katarina@Nick Toren@Sally Leung Bayer@Charlotte Maier@Stéphane Boucher@Radu Spinghel@Scott Adkins@Yan-Sang Roussel@Boris McGiver@Stephen Rowe@Alice Taglioni@Gregory Salata@Stefan Elbaum@Charley Fouquet;Shawn Levy

Reynaldo Arenas has just gotten a job working at the National Library, although he really wants to be a writer, which he has showed great aptitude at since he was a child growing up in the countryside in Oriente province. He is just beginning to acknowledge his homosexual orientation. With the support of like-minded friends, Reinaldo begins to flourish both sexually and artistically, and he becomes a world renowned writer. But by the 1970s, he is feeling more and more repressed by the Cuban authorities, both for his work and his homosexuality, despite he having fought for the Castro led revolutionary forces when he was a teenager. Although he is able to smuggle manuscripts out of Cuba to get published, he himself has a more difficult time trying to get out. The police use any excuse to arrest, detain and or imprison him. In May 1980, he is finally able to leave to the US in a purge by Castro of anyone who doesn't support the regime. But in the US, Reinaldo is plagued by other demons.              ;NA;65;32;Alejandro Amenábar;Alejandro Amenábar@Fernando Bovaira@Emiliano Otegui;Javier Bardem@Belén Rueda@Lola Duenas@Mabel Rivera@Celso Bugallo@Clara Segura@Joan Dalmau@Alberto Jiménez@Tamar Novas@Francesc Garrido@Josep Maria Pou@Alberto Amarilla@Andrea Occhipinti@Federico Pérez Rey@Nicolás Fernández Luna@Raúl Lavisier@Xosé Manuel Olveira 'Pico'@César Cambeiro@Xosé Manuel Esperante@Yolanda Muinos@Adolfo Obregón@José Luis Rodríguez@Julio Jordán@Juan Manuel Vidal@Marta Larralde@Jordi Ballester;Alejandro Amenábar

Raymond hates her, not only for how she's treated him but equally because of his step-father, the ineffectual U.S. Senator John Iselin, who is intent on seeking higher office. When Marco learns that others in his Korean War unit have nightmares similar to his own, he realizes that something happened to all of them in Korea and that Raymond Shaw is the focal point.

Commander Finchhaven, a ghostly relic from the First World War, he had fallen down dead drunk on his first assignment and been consigned from the great beyond to sail the seas until a further opportunity arises to redeem his actions. During the Second World War, he is encountered by a quartet of American seamen that includes Lt. Morton Krim and cook W.J. Oglethorpe. A deal is completed whereby the men will help re-float Finchhaven's command in return for a passage to Australia. They raid a village to secure batteries for the engine and come upon the feisty Jennifer Winslow who offers them aid in return for a passage with the crew. Eventually they reach the open sea. Finchhaven's ghostly status is revealed and Lt. Krim and Jennifer help him to sink a Japanese cruiser.              ;2;7;4;David Amram;George Axelrod@John Frankenheimer@Howard W.

Branch Rickey is a Major League team executive with a bold idea. To that end, Rickey recruits Robinson to break the unspoken color line as the first modern African American Major League player. As both anticipate, this proves a major challenge for Robinson and his family as they endure unrelenting racist hostility on and off the field, from player and fan alike. As Jackie struggles against his nature to endure such abuse without complaint, he finds allies and hope where he least expects it.

When a UFO is sighted, it is called an encounter of the first kind. When evidence is collected, it is known as an encounter of the second kind. When contact is made with extraterrestrials, it is the third kind. The next level, abduction, is the fourth kind. Modern-day, Alaska, where-mysteriously since the 1960s-a disproportionate number of the population has been reported missing every year. Despite multiple FBI investigations of the region, the truth has never been discovered. Here in this remote region, psychologist Dr. Abigail Tyler began videotaping sessions with traumatized patients and unwittingly discovered some of the most disturbing evidence of alien abduction ever documented. The Fourth Kind exposes the terrified revelations of multiple witnesses. Their accounts of being visited by alien figures all share disturbingly identical details, the validity of which is investigated throughout the film.

Every other day, Hélene commutes to Paris and Charles suspects that she might be having an affair. He hires a private detective and a couple of days later, his suspicion is confirmed. The investigator tells him that Hélene is having a love affair with the writer Victor Pégala and delivers a picture of her lover with his address to him. Charles visits Victor at his apartment in Paris and introduces himself as Hélene's husband. He lies by telling him that he has an agreement with his wife to tell him about her encounters. Suddenly,and without warning, Charles hits Victor's head with a statue and kills him, and dumps the body in a lake before returning home. Detectives Duval and Gobet are assigned to investigate and interview Hélene, explaining that Victor is missing and her name is in her address book. When Hélene finds the picture of Victor in Charles' jacket pocket, she destroys the evidence and learns that her husband loves her.

Over his wife's objections, a man rises in the early morning and leaves her with their disabled daughter to meet two men. He's a Stalker, one of a handful who have the mental gifts (and who risk imprisonment) to lead people into the Zone to the Room, a place where one's secret hopes come true. His clients are a burned out popular writer, cynical, and questioning his talent, and a quiet scientist more concerned about his knapsack than the journey. In the deserted Zone, the approach to the Room must be indirect. As they draw near, the rules seem to change and the stalker faces a crisis.

Her mother is an alcoholic street singer, her father a circus performer, her paternal grandmother a madam. During childhood she lives with each of them. At 20, she's a street singer discovered by a club owner who's soon murdered, coached by a musician who brings her to concert halls, and then quickly famous. Constant companions are alcohol and heartache. The tragedies of her love affair with Marcel Cerdan and the death of her only child belie the words of one of her signature songs, "Non, je ne regrette rien."

Alexi Fradis is a gifted student at a music school in Riga, Latvia, U.S.S.R. From a working class family, Alexi is resting his future on getting into the music academy. Alexi likes Valentina Kirov, one of his classmates who comes from a privileged background and who does not have a natural talent for music like him, but who still dreams of becoming a concert pianist. From a trip to the west, Alexi's Uncle Dimitri, a seaman and violinist, illegally smuggles into the country some 45's for him. After listening to the records, Alexi has no idea what type of music it is, but he is invigorated by what he hears. It's rock and roll, banned music as it is deemed anti-Communist. Regardless, it begins to influence Alexi's musical direction, he and three friends who have thoughts of starting their own rock and roll band, which is again an illegal act. Alexi's best friend, Sasha Kostygin, has flooded the underground market with bootlegged copies of Alexi's records. The authorities find out about the recordings, the authorities who include Valentina's high ranking government diplomat father. As the authorities begin to clamp down on the perpetrators of promoting this banned music, Alexi has to decide if his want for free musical expression is worth the price of potentially not making it into the music academy and/or losing his freedom altogether.              ;NA;4;12;Mark Isham;Karim Abouobayd@Laurence Becsey@Emilio Diez Barroso@Erik Feig@David Garrett@Gregory J.

Simon has finally been able to get Carli D'Amato, who he has been in love with since they were children, to be his girlfriend. Largely because they will be going away to different schools in the fall, Carli breaks up with him. To get Simon's singularly focused mind off Carli, his three best mates decide to take him on vacation for two weeks to get some sun, sand and girls before they move onto the next chapter of their lives in the fall.

Simon Cooper, Jay Cartwright and Neil Sutherland have been friends for some time. Insecure Simon's main quest in life is to get long time friend, Carli D'Amato, to be his girlfriend. Jay is the big talker whose stories, especially about his sexual conquests, are more fantasy than reality. And slightly dim-witted Neil is generally two steps behind everyone else in comprehension of life, and who is always defending his father from beliefs that he's a closet homosexual. Into the group comes its fourth member, Will McKenzie, who met them when he transferred into their school, Rudge Park Comprehensive, at the start of sixth form, as Will's newly divorced mum could no longer afford his private school tuition. Nerdish and straight-laced Will, ridiculed for carrying a briefcase, insinuated himself in the group - not aiming his sights too high - as he tried not to be labeled as one of the freaks. Regardless, he is still the target of the school's "psycho bully", Mark Donovan, and the head of Rudge Park's sixth form, Mr. Gilbert. Will's initial saving grace in bonding with his new mates may have been that they all want to shag his pretty but protective mother, Polly.              ;NA;2;4;Mike Skinner;Shane Allen@Rhianna Andrews@Damon Beesley@Charles Hubbard@Caroline Leddy@Leo Martin@Iain Morris@Mike Morris@Rosa Romero@David Root@Christopher Young;Simon Bird@James Buckley@Blake Harrison@Joe Thomas@Emily Head@Lydia Rose Bewley@Laura Haddock@Tamla Kari@Jessica Knappett@Theo Barklem-Biggs@Theo James@Anthony Head@Victoria Willing@Greg Davies@Henry Lloyd-Hughes@Belinda Stewart-Wilson@Robin Weaver@Martin Trenaman@Alex Macqueen@David Schaal@Sophie Colquhoun@Carolin Stoltz@Etalia Turnball@Dominic Frisby;Ben Palmer

Gerson asks Frank to help but Frank still holds a grudge. But after some prodding he agrees but only if he and his team can go there so he can fix it.

The story follows the arc of their relationship and his interaction with her family. Told in flashback form, initially Hauer is seen as a libertine lothario collector, taking trophies from his sexual conquests and pasting them in a book. He sees a sculpture he made of his lost lover and goes into a flashback of his relationship with his wife. He meets the girl, falls in love with/marries her, and we meet her parents: a charming, well meaning, bumbling father, and his shrew of a wife, who's convinced Hauer's too much of a bohemian to make a good mate for her daughter. Eventually, the petty jealousies, the sexual hijinks, and the climactic vomit scene prove too much for the marriage, and sculptor and his lady fair separate. Flash forward several months, and Hauer finds the girl back in Holland after an American sojourn. Their reunion is short lived; the somewhat melodramatic ending mirrors "Love Story".              ;NA;15;18;Anne Dudley;Graham Begg@Jeroen Beker@Jeremy Burdek@Jamie Carmichael@Regina Frankenberger@Sara Giles@Andreas Grosch@Teun Hilte@Nadia Khamlichi@Micha Kovler@San Fu Maltha@Jindra Markus@Jens Meurer@Henning Molfenter@Marc Noyons@Justine Paauw@Adrian Politowski@Laurette Schillings@Andreas Schmid@Marcus Schöfer@Jos van der Linden@Frans van Gestel@Charlie Woebcken@Marc Wächter;Carice van Houten@Sebastian Koch@Thom Hoffman@Halina Reijn@Waldemar Kobus@Derek de Lint@Christian Berkel@Dolf de Vries@Peter Blok@Michiel Huisman@Ronald Armbrust@Frank Lammers@Matthias Schoenaerts@Johnny de Mol@Xander Straat@Diana Dobbelman@Rixt Leddy@Lidewij Mahler@Pieter Tiddens@Gijs Naber@Dirk Zeelenberg@Michiel de Jong@Jobst Schnibbe@Boris Saran@Jack Vecht@Jacqueline Blom@Seth Kamphuijs@Herman Boerman@Skip Goeree@Bert Luppes@Marisa Van Eyle@Heleen Mineur@Bas van der Horst;Paul Verhoeven

tt0335119;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335119/;Dziewczyna z perla;2003;100 min; 21 May 2004 (Poland) ;Biography@Drama@Romance; This film, adapted from a work of fiction by author Tracy Chevalier, tells a story about the events surrounding the creation of the painting "Girl With a Pearl Earring" by 17th century Dutch master Johannes Vermeer. Little is known about the girl in the painting, it is speculated that she was a maid who lived in the house of the painter along with his family and other servants, though there is no historical evidence. This masterful film attempts to recreate the mysterious girl's life. Griet, played by Scarlett Johansson, is a maid in the house of painter Johannes Vermeer, played by British actor Colin Firth. Vermeer's wealthy patron and sole means of support, Van Ruijven, commissions him to paint Griet with the intent that he will have her for himself before it is finished. She must somehow secretly pose for the crucial painting without the knowledge of Vermeer's wife, avoid Van Ruijven's grasp, and protect herself from the cruel gossip of the world of a 17th century servant.

When his wife Sarah falls off the wagon and dumps him for Jacques, a drug dealer, Frank tries to get her back by reporting her kidnapped, grabbing her from Jacques' car, and wailing for her to return. After watching Christian TV and having a vision, he becomes a superhero to fight evil. He sews a costume, finds a weapon (a pipe wrench) and looks for crimes to stop. He has problems: his wrench inflicts real injury, so the cops want him for being a vigilante, his sense of boundaries is flawed, and Jacques' gang has guns. Libby, a clerk at a comic book store, becomes his sidekick, and it's time to go save Sarah. What chance do they have?

His hellfire brand of comedy has rained verbal lightning bolts on American audiences and politicians for decades, yet you've probably never heard of him. But once you've experienced Bobcat Goldthwait's brilliant character portrait of him and heard Crimmins's secret, you will never forget him. From his unmistakable bullish frame came a scathingly ribald stand-up style that took early audiences by force. Through stark, smart observation and judo-like turns of phrase, Crimmins's rapid-fire comedy was a war on ignorance and complacency in '80s America at the height of an ill-considered foreign policy. Crimmins discusses another side of his character, revealing in detail a dark and painful past that inspired his life-changing campaign of activism in the hope of saving others from a similar experience. Interviews with comics like Margaret Cho and Marc Maron illustrate Crimmins's love affair with comedy and his role in discovering and supporting the development of many of today's stars. As a venerated member of America's comic community, Crimmins could be your newest national treasure.

K. is a comedy of ideas about a stranger in the city, who asks questions that no one has asked before. They are innocent, child-like questions, but they bring about catastrophic answers. People who are set in their ways for generations, are forced to reappraise their world when they see it from PK's innocent eyes. In the process PK makes loyal friends and powerful foes. Mends broken lives and angers the establishment. P. K.'s childlike curiosity transforms into a spiritual odyssey for him and millions of others. The film is an ambitious and uniquely original exploration of complex philosophies. It is also a simple and humane tale of love, laughter and letting-go.

The resulting publicity from Bei's heroism brings him to the attention of a private investigator who informs him that he is actually the long-lost son of a wealthy businessman.

This 16-minute short opens with a short (about 4 minutes) study of boxing's history, narrated by veteran newscaster Douglas Edwards in a no-nonsense, noir tone of voice. After this, we follow Walter (and his twin brother Vincent) through his day as he prepares for his 10:00 P.M. bout. After eating breakfast, going to early mass and eating lunch, he starts arranging his things for the fight at 4:00 P.M. By 8:00, he is waiting in his dressing room, where he undergoes a mental transformation, turning into the fighting machine the crowd clamors for. At 10:00, he faces James, and soon, he comes out victorious in a short match which was filmed live on April 17th, 1950.              ;NA;NA;NA;Gerald Fried;James B.

tt0975645;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0975645/;Hitchcock;2012;98 min; 1 March 2013 (Poland) ;Biography@Drama; In 1959, Alfred Hitchcock and his wife, Alma, are at the top of their creative game as filmmakers amid disquieting insinuations about it being time to retire. To recapture his youth's artistic daring, Alfred decides his next film will adapt the lurid horror novel, Psycho, over everyone's misgivings. Unfortunately, as Alfred self-finances and labors on this film, Alma finally loses patience with his roving eye and controlling habits with his actresses. When an ambitious friend lures her to collaborate on a work of their own, the resulting marital tension colors Alfred's work even as the novel's inspiration haunts his dreams.

They are already taxed to the bone by the British and their cronies, but when Jack Russell announces that he will double the Lagaan (tax) from all villagers, they decide to oppose it. Leading the villagers is a handsome young man named Bhuvan, who challenges them to a game of cricket, a game that is to be played by veteran British cricket players, versus villagers, including Bhuvan himself, who have never played this game before, and do not even know a bat from a piece of wood. As the challenge is accepted, the interest grows and attracts Indians from all over the region, as well as the British from all over the country - as everyone gathers to see the 'fair play' that the British will display against their counter-parts, who are aided by none other than the sister, Elizabeth, of Captain Rusell.

The film's theme of liberty is manifested in Julie's attempt to start life anew, free of personal commitments, belongings, grief or love. She intends to numb herself by withdrawing from the world and living completely independently, anonymously and in solitude in the Parisian metropolis. Despite her intentions, people from her former and present life intrude with their own needs. However, the reality created by the people who need and care about her, a surprising discovery and the music around which the film revolves heal Julie and draws her back to the land of the living.

With thin hands, and big frightened eyes. Mansur took her from her home to a faraway Moscow. Before the wedding Yildiz shed a few tears for she was afraid. She had never been in a big city before; what would it be like to live there among strangers? Uncle Mirza even lost his temper with her; from now on Mansur was her husband, he wouldn't do any harm, she had to obey him and not annoy him. She soon became used to her husband. He was kind. He would get her a Russian passport, would help her to learn the language, and would buy her nice dresses. She was nervous when he first did not return home at night. She was not angry when he did not show up for two days, and she just waited for him. Then she spent a whole week alone. She grew accustomed to eating small portions of food so that it would not run out. It was Mansur who had forbidden her to go out. It was dangerous. Once she had ventured outside she would be taken to a police station, and she would be raped and killed. And nobody would come looking for her, because she was a stranger here, a foreigner, and she had no passport. And then Mansur stopped returning home at all. She was not angry; for it was as it should be. She just kept counting the chocolates he had bought her the last time, one chocolate for each day that had passed. Then she ran out of chocolates. She did not try to go out. Only at night she would openi the front door to steal the leftovers that her neighbors used to feed a homeless cat, and each day Yildiz let that cat go hungry. It became dark and quite at home. The electricity and gas supply to here apartment was cut off.. Only the water tap still drip. And one day they came. Two Russians, evil and armed. They kept shouting: "Mansur, Mansur!". They cursed and beat her. She was unable to explain that Mansur had not had time to teach her Russian. How long had they been in her flat? A week, a month, a year? What did they need? When would they leave? She could not understand what they were saying. And suddenly uncle Mirza arrived. Yildiz thought that he had come for her. That he would take her back home from this scary city. But he paid no attention to her. He pushed her into the corner and shouted: "Where is your bastard husband? Where is my money?". But what did she know; for she knew nothing. She cried, covering her head with her hands. She did not see who was the first one to shoot. Cartridge cases clinked as they struck the floor. She was so scared that she fainted. When she came to, she was the only one alive in the apartment.. She was scared of the bodies, so she dragged them onto the balcony. For some reason she covered them with blankets. As if they could feel cold. And then Mansur came back. Old, thin, and scared. He was so tired he could not speak. She took him to the bedroom and covered him with a blanket. Then she sang him her grandmother's lullaby, so that he should slept soundly. She lay down next to him, snuggled up to him and hugged him. And whispered: "How cold you are...".              ;3;13;30;James Horner;Michael London@Shawn Lawrence Otto@Vadim Perelman@Nina R.

After persuading a mad wig salesman, known as the Scalper, to sell them his leads, the two embark on a series of house calls--always in neighborhoods that are dangerous for one or the other partner. Then they find out they may lose their exclusive wig distributorship to competitors. Through a series of comic twists, the pair are given large orders for wigs by both sides of the Protestant/Catholic conflict. Should they compromise their principles in order to keep their business? Will it destroy their friendship? Could one of their wigs in the hands of the IRA actually put one or both of them in jail or even get them killed?              ;NA;4;5;Christopher Young;Ashok Amritraj@Jim Andrino@Michele Berk@Michael Birnbaum@Stephen J.

tt0864761;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0864761/;Ksiezna;2008;110 min; 9 January 2009 (Poland) ;Biography@Drama@History; Georgiana Spencer became Duchess of Devonshire on her marriage to the Duke in 1774, at the height of the Georgian period, a period of fashion, decadence, and political change. Spirited and adored by the public at large she quickly found her marriage to be a disappointment, defined by her duty to produce a male heir and the Duke's philandering and callous indifference to her. She befriends Lady Bess but finds she is once again betrayed by her husband who wields his power with the three eventually living uncomfortably together. Against this background, and with the pressures of an unfaithful husband, strict social pressures and constant public scrutiny, Georgiana falls passionately in love with Charles Grey, a rising young Whig politician. However, despite his ongoing liaison with Lady Bess, the Duke refuses to allow her to continue the affair and threatens to take her children from her.

His girlfriend Veronica "Ronnie" Tate is a newspaper reporter. Scott and Carmen have a dog named Troy. While listening to a baseball game on his car stereo, Scott is called downtown where a man named Earl is holding 17 hostages in a bank. Scott rescues the hostages by shooting Earl. Scott is then assigned a partner -- sharpshooter Kevin McCall. That night, Scott takes his friend, Lieutenant Sam Baffert, to see a man named Michael Korda. Scott waits downstairs while Sam is in Korda's apartment. Sam asks Korda about a man who deals in stolen jewelry, because Sam suspects that some of the dealer's jewels came from Korda, who is a professional jewel thief. Sam's visit with Korda ends with Korda killing Sam. When Scott hears a woman in the building scream at the sight of Sam's body, Scott runs inside the building and sees the body. Scott wants revenge on Korda, but Captain Frank Solis refuses to let Scott work the case, so Scott decides to work the case on his own. Scott and Kevin go to a horse race track, where they win a bundle of money, then they are called to a downtown jewelry store where hostages are being held. When Scott notices that Korda is the hostage taker, Korda grabs a hostage and leaves in a truck. Scott and Kevin use Captain Solis's car to chase Korda. Korda wrecks the truck, and leaves the hostage behind when he gets out of the truck. Korda then boards a trolley car, and Scott and Kevin start chasing the trolley car. While up close, Scott jumps onto the trolley car, leaving Kevin to drive Solis's car. Scott and Kevin manage to stop the trolley car, and they chase Korda into a parking garage, where Korda tries to hit Scott with a car. Scott and Kevin still manage to grab Korda. During visitation at the jail with his cousin Clarence Teal, Korda orders Teal to kill Ronnie as a way to get revenge on Scott. Teal shows up at Ronnie's apartment that night and attacks Ronnie. Scott shows up and chases Teal down the fire escape, and Teal is hit and killed by a car. On the next morning, Korda escapes from the jail, and soon after escaping, Korda kidnaps Ronnie, luring Scott into a confrontation at an abandoned shipyard.              ;NA;NA;2;Nile Rodgers;Leslie Belzberg@Mark Lipsky@Catherine Meyers@Ray Murphy Jr.@Mace Neufeld@Robert Rehme;Eddie Murphy@Jon Tenney@Joey Travolta@Eugene Collier@Jimmy Ortega@Ousaun Elam@Ray Lykins@Tim Gilbert@Rick Avery@Gilbert R.

As he does everyday, Sal Fragione opens the pizza parlor he's owned for 25 years. The neighborhood has changed considerably in the time he's been there and is now composed primarily of African-Americans and Hispanics. His son Pino hates it there and would like nothing better than to relocate the eatery to their own neighborhood. For Sal however, the restaurant represents something that is part of his life and sees it as a part of the community. What begins as a simple complaint by one of his customers, Buggin Out - who wonders why he has only pictures of famous Italian-Americans on the wall when most of his customers are black - eventually disintegrates into violence as frustration seemingly brings out the worst in everyone.
