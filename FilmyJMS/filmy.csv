At the early age of 12, he witnessed the death of his father at the hands of local military authorities, during a well-meant attempt to hand-over a package of drugs he had incidentally found at sea while fishing. As a result of this experience, Julian develops a thirst for revenge that leads him to kill all those involved in his father's death. In the process he becomes a major drug lord and a very powerful headman within Dominican society. Nevertheless, despite his overwhelming power and easy access to everything and anything he could want out of life, he meets a woman who drives him to self-confrontation: Laura, who despite having experienced life events far more dramatic than those lived by Julian, decides to choose a path of love rather than one of vengeance. Ultimately, Julian carries-out his plan, which includes the murder of someone very dear to him, only to realize - through Laura - that his life is now far emptier than it ever was.              ;NA;NA;NA;PengBian Sang;Adrian Agramonte@Carlota Carretero@Rafael Cespedes@Rafael De Marchena@Richard Douglas@Victoria Kluge@Jose Lluberes@Archie Lopez@Luisito Marti@Lawrence Martin@Joseph Medina@Miguel Ángel Muniz@Elías Munoz@Manuel Pouerie;Luisito Marti@Caridad Ravelo@Raúl Carbonell@Rafael Villalona@Joel Garcia@Alfonso Zayas@Bersaida Vega@Rosalba Rolon@Manny Gironny@Ledesma@Rafael Decena@Graciela Mas@Carlota Carretero@Fermín Suárez@Rosmery 'Boquita' Almonte@Rina Mejia;Ángel Muniz

Since then, he met his current wife Kristine, they had a daughter Kathy, and he has tried to live his life on the straight and narrow... or so he says. San Francisco Police Inspector Mike Vido is certain that Eddie was one of two who recently held up a grocery store and in the process shot and killed its proprietress point blank, and used the moneys from the robbery to place a down payment on a fishing boat. Vido has been tracking Eddie for years - sometimes to the point of harassment - since Vido is also certain that it was Eddie who once shot him in the gut during a robbery, despite Vido having only seen the shooter's eyes. Vido's current harassment causes problems for Eddie in maintaining a job. Walter and the rest of the gang also reenter Eddie's life - which is against the stipulations of Eddie's parole - Walter who wants to enlist Eddie in one last big heist worth $1 million. These events place a strain on Eddie and Kristine's relationship. As Vido provides Eddie with some news about the grocery store hold-up, Eddie and Kristine individually make some decisions on how best to move forward in their lives.              ;NA;NA;NA;Carlo Rustichelli;Ralph Baum@Raymond Danon@Alain Delon;Alain Delon@Mireille Darc@Monica Guerritore@Marie Déa@Christian Barbier@André Falcon@Stefano Patrizi@Felice Andreasi@Michel Duchaussoy@Henri Attal@Baaron@Bhime Souaré@Philippe Brigaud@Geoffrey Carey@Suzanne Carra@Muriel Catalá@Lyne Chardonnet@Luc Delhumeau@André Dumas@Colette Duval;Édouard Molinaro

As such, in the night of November 26-27, 1940, the Death Teams executed forty political prisoners in the Jilava prison (in the movie, named "Viraga"), and next day, other two Teams arrested and shot the former minister Virgil Madgearu and the world famous historian Nicolae Iorga (in the movie: Costin Märgeanu and Nicolae Jugu). To squash down the political outcry, the Police Prefect Stefan Zävoianu (Visan Nävodeanu) conveniently assigns the cases to a commissioner from the "Morals Division" (prostitution, thieves), Tudor Moldovan, hoping that he will fail to get to the bottom of the case. However, Moldovan has communist sympathies, so he quickly comes under the influence of the Bolshevik Pîrvu, who had escaped during the Viraga massacre, only to be later apprehended again by the police. Pîrvu being an old friend and work mate of Moldovan's father, he feeds to the commissioner all the well-known soviet propaganda, during the interrogatories. Thus gained on the left side, Moldovan turns against the Iron Guards, in a short time gathering enough evidence to close the case. Hearing about this, the Iron Guard Senator Naumescu (Nae Ionescu) tries to bribe Moldovan - but the commissioner only accepts the money (one briefcase containing half a million lei, worth his salary for ten years) to use it for financing the communist party. He then delivers the file to the "Universul" newspaper, but the Legionnaire commissioner Paraipan, his arch enemy, retrieves it before going into print. Learning this, Naumescu orders Moldovan's dispatching. After a long and noisy series of shootouts and street action, Moldovan gradually shoots eight out of the new members of Paraipan's team, sparing only Tänäsescu, who had been assigned as his assistant during the investigation. Loyal to the cause, Tänäsescu informs Naumescu about Moldovan's whereabouts - so the Senator lays a trap for the commissioner, using Tänäsescu as bait. At the height of an unequal confrontation, in the heart of the Plumbuita slum, Moldovan is ridden with bullets by a few dozens of Legionnaires.              ;NA;NA;NA;George Grigoriu;Lidia Popita;Florin Piersic@Marga Barbu@Ion Marinescu@Iurie Darie@Remus Margineanu@Ernest Maftei@Toma Dimitriu@Petre Gheorghiu Dolj@Adrian Stefanescu@Ion Besoiu@Constantin Dinulescu@Vasile Constantinescu@Emil Coseru@Traian Stanescu@Ovidiu Schumacher@Nucu Paunescu@Constantin Diamandi@Ion Pascu@Adrian Horbaci@Eugeniu Ungureanu@Mihai Marta@Livia Baba@Anda Caropol;Doru Nastase
